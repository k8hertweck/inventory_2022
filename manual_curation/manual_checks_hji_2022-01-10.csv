29746699,RepeatsDB-lite: a web server for unit annotation of tandem repeat proteins.,"RepeatsDB-lite (http://protein.bio.unipd.it/repeatsdb-lite) is a web server for the prediction of repetitive structural elements and units in tandem repeat (TR) proteins. TRs are a widespread but poorly annotated class of non-globular proteins carrying heterogeneous functions. RepeatsDB-lite extends the prediction to all TR types and strongly improves the performance both in terms of computational time and accuracy over previous methods, with precision above 95% for solenoid structures. The algorithm exploits an improved TR unit library derived from the RepeatsDB database to perform an iterative structural search and assignment. The web interface provides tools for analyzing the evolutionary relationships between units and manually refine the prediction by changing unit positions and protein classification. An all-against-all structure-based sequence similarity matrix is calculated and visualized in real-time for every user edit. Reviewed predictions can be submitted to RepeatsDB for review and inclusion.",0,"affliated with a DB, but a server for it…"
24067102,DaGO-Fun: tool for Gene Ontology-based functional analysis using term information content measures.,"<h4>Background</h4>The use of Gene Ontology (GO) data in protein analyses have largely contributed to the improved outcomes of these analyses. Several GO semantic similarity measures have been proposed in recent years and provide tools that allow the integration of biological knowledge embedded in the GO structure into different biological analyses. There is a need for a unified tool that provides the scientific community with the opportunity to explore these different GO similarity measure approaches and their biological applications.<h4>Results</h4>We have developed DaGO-Fun, an online tool available at http://web.cbio.uct.ac.za/ITGOM, which incorporates many different GO similarity measures for exploring, analyzing and comparing GO terms and proteins within the context of GO. It uses GO data and UniProt proteins with their GO annotations as provided by the Gene Ontology Annotation (GOA) project to precompute GO term information content (IC), enabling rapid response to user queries.<h4>Conclusions</h4>The DaGO-Fun online tool presents the advantage of integrating all the relevant IC-based GO similarity measures, including topology- and annotation-based approaches to facilitate effective exploration of these measures, thus enabling users to choose the most relevant approach for their application. Furthermore, this tool includes several biological applications related to GO semantic similarity scores, including the retrieval of genes based on their GO annotations, the clustering of functionally related genes within a set, and term enrichment analysis.",0,analysis only I think…
30652085,PDB_Amyloid: an extended live amyloid structure list from the PDB.,"The Protein Data Bank (PDB) contains more than 135†000 entries at present. From these, relatively few amyloid structures can be identified, since amyloids are insoluble in water. Therefore, most amyloid structures deposited in the PDB are in the form of solid state NMR data. Based on the geometric analysis of these deposited structures, we have prepared an automatically updated web server, which generates a list of the deposited amyloid structures, and also entries of globular proteins that have amyloid-like substructures of given size and characteristics. We have found that by applying only appropriately selected geometric conditions, it is possible to identify deposited amyloid structures and a number of globular proteins with amyloid-like substructures. We have analyzed these globular proteins and have found proof in the literature that many of them form amyloids more easily than many other globular proteins. Our results relate to the method of Stankovic <i>et†al</i>. [Stankovic I <i>et†al</i>. (2017) IPSI BgD Tran Int Res 13, 47-51], who applied a hybrid textual-search and geometric approach for finding amyloids in the PDB. If one intends to identify a subset of the PDB for certain applications, the identification algorithm needs to be re-run periodically, since in 2017 on average 30 new entries per day were deposited in the data bank. Our web server is updated regularly and automatically, and the identified amyloid and partial amyloid structures can be viewed or their list can be downloaded from the following website https://pitgroup.org/amyloid.",1,based on PDB though

Although the body of published works is remarkable for a small nation, the faunistic data has remained too scattered for a thorough understanding of regional biotic diversity, for comparative and ecological research, and for informed conservation purposes. A national checklist is long overdue. Here, a critical review of all published records in any language is provided. The species list currently comprises 738 species, is published online at http://www.bioportal.si/katalog/araneae.php under the title Araneae Sloveniae, and will be updated in due course.

Using gene-set analysis on high throughput gene expression profiling controlled by various environmental factors is a commonly adopted technique used by the cancer research community. This work develops a comprehensive gene expression analysis tool (gene-set activity toolbox: (GAT)) that is implemented with data retriever, traditional data pre-processing, several gene-set analysis methods, network visualization and data mining tools. The gene-set analysis methods are used to identify subsets of phenotype-relevant genes that will be used to build a classification model. To evaluate GAT performance, we performed a cross-dataset validation study on three common cancers namely colorectal, breast and lung cancers. The results show that GAT can be used to build a reasonable disease diagnostic model and the predicted markers have biological relevance. GAT can be accessed from http://gat.sit.kmutt.ac.th where GAT's java library for gene-set analysis, simple classification and a database with three cancer benchmark datasets can be downloaded.",1,benchmark datasets
27551106,PPI4DOCK: large scale assessment of the use of homology models in free docking over more than 1000 realistic targets.,"<h4>Motivation</h4>Protein-protein docking methods are of great importance for understanding interactomes at the structural level. It has become increasingly appealing to use not only experimental structures but also homology models of unbound subunits as input for docking simulations. So far we are missing a large scale assessment of the success of rigid-body free docking methods on homology models.<h4>Results</h4>We explored how we could benefit from comparative modelling of unbound subunits to expand docking benchmark datasets. Starting from a collection of 3157 non-redundant, high X-ray resolution heterodimers, we developed the PPI4DOCK benchmark containing 1417 docking targets based on unbound homology models. Rigid-body docking by Zdock showed that for 1208 cases (85.2%), at least one correct decoy was generated, emphasizing the efficiency of rigid-body docking in generating correct assemblies. Overall, the PPI4DOCK benchmark contains a large set of realistic cases and provides new ground for assessing docking and scoring methodologies.<h4>Availability and implementation</h4>Benchmark sets can be downloaded from http://biodev.cea.fr/interevol/ppi4dock/ CONTACT: guerois@cea.frSupplementary information: Supplementary data are available at Bioinformatics online.",1,benchmarking data available
23664230,Application of the Bayesian approach for derivation of PDFs for concentration ratio values.,"Concentration ratios (CRs) are used to derive activity concentrations in wild plants and animals. Usually, compilations of CR values encompass a wide range of element-organism combinations, extracted from different studies with statistical information reported at varying degrees of detail. To produce a more robust estimation of distribution parameters, data from different studies are normally pooled using classical statistical methods. However, there is inherent subjectivity involved in pooling CR data in the sense that there is a tacit assumption that the CRs under any arbitrarily defined biota category belong to the same population. Here, Bayesian inference has been introduced as an alternative way of making estimates of distribution parameters of CRs. This approach, in contrast to classical methods, is more flexible and also allows us to define the various assumptions required, when combining data, in a more explicit manner. Taking selected data from the recently compiled wildlife transfer database (http://www.wildlifetransferdatabase.org/) as a working example, attempts are made to refine the pooling approaches previously used and to consider situations when empirical data are limited.",0,but usedful ref
34019885,Interventions to decrease complications after shoulder dystocia: a systematic review and Bayesian meta-analysis.,"<h4>Objective</h4>This study aimed to evaluate the outcomes associated with the implementation of simulation exercises to reduce the sequela of shoulder dystocia.<h4>Data sources</h4>Electronic databases (Ovid MEDLINE, Embase, the Cumulative Index to Nursing and Allied Health Literature database, and Scopus) were initially queried in June 2020 and updated in November 2020. The following 3 concepts were introduced and refined using the controlled vocabulary of the database: vaginal birth, shoulder dystocia, and simulation training. There were no limitations to the year of publication as part of the search strategy.<h4>Study eligibility criteria</h4>We included all studies that reported on the frequency of shoulder dystocia and the associated complications before and after the implementation of interventional exercises to improve outcomes.<h4>Methods</h4>Two authors independently assessed the abstracts and full-text articles of all studies for eligibility and evaluated the quality of the included studies using the Newcastle-Ottawa Scale. Any inconsistencies related to study evaluation or data extraction were resolved by a third author. The coprimary outcomes of this systematic review and meta-analysis were neonatal brachial plexus palsy diagnosed following deliveries complicated by shoulder dystocia and persistence of brachial palsy at 12 months or later. The secondary outcomes were the frequency of shoulder dystocia and cesarean delivery. Study effects were combined using a Bayesian meta-analysis and were reported as risk ratios and 95% credible intervals (Crs).<h4>Results</h4>Of the 372 articles reviewed, 16 publications, which included 428,552 deliveries with 217,713 (50.8%) deliveries during the preintervention and 210,839 (49.2%) deliveries during the postinterventional period, were included in the meta-analysis. The incidence of neonatal brachial plexus palsy after shoulder dystocia decreased from 12.1% to 5.7% (risk ratio, 0.37; 95% Cr, 0.26-0.57; probability of reduction 100%). The overall proportion of neonatal brachial plexus palsy decreased, but with less precision, from 0.3% to 0.1% (risk ratio, 0.53; 95% Cr, 0.21-1.26; probability of reduction 94%). Two studies followed newborns with brachial plexus palsy for at least 12 months. One study that reported on persistent neonatal brachial plexus palsy at 12 months among 1148 shoulder dystocia cases noted a reduction in persistent neonatal brachial plexus palsy from 1.9% to 0.2% of shoulder dystocia cases (risk ratio, 0.13; 95% confidence interval, 0.04-0.49). In contrast, the study that reported on persistent neonatal brachial plexus palsy at 12 months for all deliveries noted that it did not change significantly, namely from 0.3 to 0.2 per 1000 births (risk ratio, 0.77; 95% confidence interval, 0.31-1.90). Following the implementation of shoulder dystocia interventional exercises, the diagnosis of shoulder dystocia increased significantly from 1.2% to 1.7% of vaginal deliveries (risk ratio, 1.39; 95% Cr, 1.19-1.65; probability of increase 100%). Compared with the preimplementation period, the cesarean delivery rate increased postimplementation from 21.2% to 25.9% (risk ratio, 1.22; 95% Cr, 0.93-1.59; probability of increase 93%). We created an online tool (https://ccrebm-bell.shinyapps.io/sdmeta/) that permits calculation of the absolute risk reduction and absolute risk increase attributable to the intervention vis-‡-vis the incidence of shoulder dystocia, neonatal brachial plexus palsy, and cesarean deliveries.<h4>Conclusion</h4>Introduction of shoulder dystocia interventional exercises decreased the rate of neonatal brachial plexus palsy per shoulder dystocia case; the data on persistence of neonatal brachial plexus palsy beyond 12 months is limited and contradictory. Implementation of the interventions was associated with an increase in the diagnosis of shoulder dystocia and rate of cesarean deliveries.",0,calcualtion tool
30185806,Machine learning identified an Alzheimer's disease-related FDG-PET pattern which is also expressed in Lewy body dementia and Parkinson's disease dementia.,"Utilizing the publicly available neuroimaging database enabled by Alzheimer's disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI; http://adni.loni.usc.edu/ ), we have compared the performance of automated classification algorithms that differentiate AD vs. normal subjects using Positron Emission Tomography (PET) with fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG). General linear model, scaled subprofile modeling and support vector machines were examined. Among the tested classification methods, support vector machine with Iterative Single Data Algorithm produced the best performance, i.e., sensitivity (0.84) ◊ specificity (0.95), by 10-fold cross-validation. We have applied the same classification algorithm to four different datasets from ADNI, Health Science Centre (Winnipeg, Canada), Dong-A University Hospital (Busan, S. Korea) and Asan Medical Centre (Seoul, S. Korea). Our data analyses confirmed that the support vector machine with Iterative Single Data Algorithm showed the best performance in prediction of future development of AD from the prodromal stage (mild cognitive impairment), and that it was also sensitive to other types of dementia such as Parkinson's Disease Dementia and Dementia with Lewy Bodies, and that perfusion imaging using single photon emission computed tomography may achieve a similar accuracy to that of FDG-PET.",0,clinical
26435838,Improving preparedness of medical students and junior doctors to manage patients with diabetes.,"<h4>Objective</h4>New medical graduates are the front-line staff in many hospital settings and manage patients with diabetes frequently. Prescribing is an area of concern for junior doctors, however, with insulin prescribing reported as a particular weakness. This study aimed to produce an educational intervention which aimed to improve preparedness to manage patients with diabetes and evaluate it using a mixed methods approach.<h4>Research design and methods</h4>An e-resource (http://www.diabetesscenariosforjuniordoctors.co.uk) was created to contain commonplace and authentic diabetes decision-making scenarios. -32 junior doctors (n=20) and year 5 students (n=12) in South West England worked through the scenarios while 'thinking aloud' and then undertook a semistructured interview. Qualitative data were transcribed verbatim and analyzed thematically. Participant confidence to manage patients with diabetes before, immediately after, and 6 weeks after the educational intervention was also measured using a self-rating scale.<h4>Results</h4>Participants reported that patients with diabetes were daunting to manage because of the wide array of insulin products, their lack of confidence with chronic disease management and the difficulty of applying theory to practice. The e-resource was described as authentic, practical, and appropriate for the target audience. Junior doctors' self-rated confidence to manage patients with diabetes increased from 4.7 (of 10) before using the e-resource, to 6.4 immediately afterwards, and 6.8 6 weeks later. Medical students' confidence increased from 5.1 before, to 6.4 immediately afterwards, and 6.4 6 weeks later.<h4>Conclusions</h4>Providing opportunities to work with authentic scenarios in a safe environment can help to ameliorate junior doctors' lack of confidence to manage patients with diabetes.",0,clinical
27399597,Development of a Korean Fracture Risk Score (KFRS) for Predicting Osteoporotic Fracture Risk: Analysis of Data from the Korean National Health Insurance Service.,"<h4>Background</h4>Asian-specific prediction models for estimating individual risk of osteoporotic fractures are rare. We developed a Korean fracture risk prediction model using clinical risk factors and assessed validity of the final model.<h4>Methods</h4>A total of 718,306 Korean men and women aged 50-90 years were followed for 7 years in a national system-based cohort study. In total, 50% of the subjects were assigned randomly to the development dataset and 50% were assigned to the validation dataset. Clinical risk factors for osteoporotic fracture were assessed at the biennial health check. Data on osteoporotic fractures during the follow-up period were identified by ICD-10 codes and the nationwide database of the National Health Insurance Service (NHIS).<h4>Results</h4>During the follow-up period, 19,840 osteoporotic fractures were reported (4,889 in men and 14,951 in women) in the development dataset. The assessment tool called the Korean Fracture Risk Score (KFRS) is comprised of a set of nine variables, including age, body mass index, recent fragility fracture, current smoking, high alcohol intake, lack of regular exercise, recent use of oral glucocorticoid, rheumatoid arthritis, and other causes of secondary osteoporosis. The KFRS predicted osteoporotic fractures over the 7 years. This score was validated using an independent dataset. A close relationship with overall fracture rate was observed when we compared the mean predicted scores after applying the KFRS with the observed risks after 7 years within each 10th of predicted risk.<h4>Conclusion</h4>We developed a Korean specific prediction model for osteoporotic fractures. The KFRS was able to predict risk of fracture in the primary population without bone mineral density testing and is therefore suitable for use in both clinical setting and self-assessment.

Videos illustrated aspects of language, sophistication of play and socialisation, cognition, and motor progress. Expert commentary, teaching text and summaries were used. A randomised controlled trial evaluated the resource. Paediatric trainees were recruited from The Sydney Children's Hospitals Network. Outcome measures were repeated at three time points (pre-teaching, immediate-post and 1 month) and included self-rated attitudes, knowledge of markers of development and observational expertise. Qualitative data on teaching usefulness were obtained through open-ended questions.<h4>Results</h4>Fifty-six paediatric trainees (registrar 79%, women 82%; mean age 31 years) completed the pre-assessment, 46 the immediate-post and 45 the 1-month follow-up (20% attrition). Compared with the Control group, the Teaching group scored higher over time on markers of development (P = 0.006), observational expertise (P < 0.0001), confidence (P = 0.035) and satisfaction (P < 0.0001). Teaching participants valued the video and expert commentary and reported improvement in confidence and understanding and acquiring a more structured approach.<h4>Conclusions</h4>The 'Beyond Milestones' free online resource for medical professionals <http://learnpaediatrics.org/beyondmilestones/ password=cunningham> improves knowledge, increases confidence and is useful, providing a structured approach to developmental assessment. The techniques taught can be applied to every paediatric consultation.",0,clinical
PMC7776433,475. Describing the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on HIV care in Latin America,"Abstract <h4>Background</h4> The effects of the COVID-19 pandemic on people living with HIV (PWH) are unknown. Beyond SARS-CoV-2 co-infection, the pandemic may have devastating consequences for HIV care delivery. Understanding these is crucial as reduced antiretroviral therapy (ART) availability alone could lead to =500,000 AIDS-related deaths in 2020ñ2021. With Latin America now a focal point in the pandemic, we sought to describe the impact of COVID-19 on HIV care at Latin American clinical sites. <h4>Methods</h4> Caribbean, Central and South America network for HIV epidemiology (CCASAnet) and additional Brazilian HIV care sites in Argentina, Brazil, Chile, Haiti, Honduras, Mexico, and Peru were included. An electronic survey of COVID-19 effects on HIV clinic operations was administered in Spanish or English via phone and email, April 28-June 2, 2020. We also compared national COVID-19 case, mortality, and policy data from public sources. <h4>Results</h4> Brazilís and Mexicoís epidemics appear most pronounced, with >10,000 confirmed COVID-19-related deaths (Figure 1); countries implemented ìsocial distancingî policies at different times after initial cases, with Haiti earliest and Mexico latest (Figure 2). Nearly all 13 sites reported decreased hours and providers for HIV care. Twelve of 13 reported increased use of telehealth, suspension/postponements of routine HIV appointments, and/or suspension of HIV research. Eleven of 13 reported initiation of new COVID-19 research but suspension of community HIV testing, and nearly half provided additional ART supplies. Nearly 70% reported impacts on HIV viral load testing and nearly 40% reported personal protective equipment stock-outs (Table). All 13 sites experienced changes in resources/services in tandem with national policies; there was wide variation, however, in the number of economic and health supports implemented thus far (e.g., quarantines, tax deferrals, interest rate reductions, etc.), from 172 COVID-19-related policies in Brazil to only 30 in Mexico.

23088694,Timing is everything: when to consult palliative care.,"<h4>Purpose</h4>Consults promote additional perspectives and help with complex patient management. As the population ages and healthcare demands increase, providers are consulting palliative care (PC). Nurse practitioners (NPs) should understand when to consult PC.<h4>Data sources</h4>Information was obtained from an extensive search of the scientific literature to include Pallimed (http://www.pallimed.org/) and the author's clinical experience.<h4>Conclusions</h4>Based on the 2009 Clinical Practice Guidelines for Quality PC developed from the Hospice and PC Coalition, PC should be consulted at diagnosis. These findings have also been validated in a landmark randomized controlled trial by Temel et al. (2010). The goals of PC are to alleviate suffering and promote quality of life for people with illnesses. PC accepts and incorporates hospice philosophies, but is distinct.<h4>Implications for practice</h4>Many professional organizations are incorporating PC into their specialties and guidelines. In addition to incorporating PC at diagnosis, PC access needs to be improved. New and experienced NPs may appreciate collaborating with PC specialists. Such conversations and relationships will likely offer practical and supportive guidance to both patients and NPs. Overall, the future for PC is promising.",0,clinical

34036443,"BDD Knowledge, Attitude and Practice Among Aesthetic Plastic Surgeons Worldwide.","<h4>Background</h4>Body dysmorphic disorder (BDD) is a controversial topic in the field of plastic surgery.<h4>Objective</h4>Our aim was to determine whether BDD knowledge, attitude and practice (KAP) are affected by the experience of the surgeon in the field, sex of the surgeon, country of practice, and the number of patients the surgeon sees annually. We were particularly interested in uncovering any significant relations in KAP of BDD between plastic surgeons practicing in developed versus developing countries.<h4>Methods</h4>We created a two-page survey of 24 questions about the KAP of BDD. The survey was sent to aesthetic plastic surgeons worldwide via ISAPS global email list. The data were collected over a period of 20 days at the end of 2020.<h4>Results</h4>A total of 464 plastic surgeons completed the survey. The only factor that determines the awareness of BDD is the experience of the surgeon. The more experienced the surgeon is, the more likely he/she is to be familiar with the clinical picture of BDD. Although aware, the more experienced surgeons tend to dismiss the importance of referring BDD patients to psychiatrists/psychologists. Male surgeons tend to diagnose more patients with BDD than female surgeons. Surgeons who estimated the correct prevalence of BDD among patients seeking surgery acquired knowledge of BDD from scientific journals. The KAP is relatively similar between surgeons practicing in developed and developing countries, and the main statistically significant difference was in the questions used during the course of the interviews to diagnose BDD.<h4>Conclusion</h4>We can deduce from the results that most aesthetic surgeons worldwide have got knowledge of the presentation of BDD and are keen to diagnose the disorder in their practice. It is worth noting that surgeons usually have their unique approach in the management of BDD. Our study highlights the importance of not only raising awareness of the best management of BDD, but also of establishing a consensus that BDD is a contraindication to aesthetic treatment. The best methods to raise awareness are through journals and plastic surgery residency.<h4>Level of evidence v</h4>This journal requires that authors assign a level of evidence to each article.

25340248,"Head Injury: Triage, Assessment, Investigation and Early Management of Head Injury in Children, Young People and Adults","For the purposes of this guideline, head injury is defined as any trauma to the head other than superficial injuries to the face. Head injury is the commonest cause of death and disability in people aged 1ñ40 years in the UK. Data for head injury are recorded in the Hospital Episode Statistics (http://www.hscic.gov.uk/hes). Each year, 1.4 million people attend emergency departments in England and Wales with a recent head injury. Between 33% and 50% of these are children aged under 15 years. Annually, about 200,000 people are admitted to hospital with head injury. Of these, one-fifth have features suggesting skull fracture or have evidence of brain damage. Most patients recover without specific or specialist intervention, but others experience long-term disability or even die from the effects of complications that could potentially be minimised or avoided with early detection and appropriate treatment. The incidence of death from head injury is low, with as few as 0.2% of all patients attending emergency departments with a head injury dying as a result of this injury. Ninety five per cent of people who have sustained a head injury present with a normal or minimally impaired conscious level (Glasgow Coma Scale [GCS] greater than 12) but the majority of fatal outcomes are in the moderate (GCS 9ñ12) or severe (GCS 8 or less) head injury groups, which account for only 5% of attenders. Therefore, emergency departments see a large number of patients with minor or mild head injuries and need to identify the very small number who will go on to have serious acute intracranial complications. It is estimated that 25ñ30% of children aged under 2 years who are hospitalised with head injury have an abusive head injury. This guideline has updated some of the terminology used in relation to safeguarding children and vulnerable adults. The previous head injury guideline produced by NICE in 2003 (NICE clinical guideline 4) and updated in 2007 (NICE clinical guideline 56) resulted in CT scanning replacing skull radiography as the primary imaging modality for assessing head injury. It also led to an increase in the proportion of people with severe head injury having their care managed in specialist centres. This has been associated with a decline in fatality among patients with severe head injury. This update is needed because of the continuing importance of up-to-date evidence-based guidance on the initial assessment and early management of head injury. Appropriate guidance can enable early detection and treatment of life-threatening brain injury, where present, but also early discharge of patients with negligible risk of brain injury. It can therefore save lives while at the same time preventing needless crowding in emergency departments and observation wards. Further key NHS changes have driven the scope of this update. These include the introduction in 2012 of regional trauma networks with major trauma triage tools within NHS England; the extension of indications for anticoagulation therapy; the expanding use of biomarkers to guide emergent clinical management in other conditions, such as chest pain; and the establishment of local safeguarding boards. The last of these addresses the requirement for front-line clinical staff to assess not only the severity of the head injury but also why it occurred.",0,clinical
32368601,Liquid based-cytology Pap smear dataset for automated multi-class diagnosis of pre-cancerous and cervical cancer lesions.,"While a publicly available benchmark dataset provides a base for the development of new algorithms and comparison of results, hospital-based data collected from the real-world clinical setup is also very important in AI-based medical research for automated disease diagnosis, prediction or classifications as per standard protocol.

26241356,In the pursuit of a semantic similarity metric based on UMLS annotations for articles in PubMed Central Open Access.,"<h4>Motivation</h4>Although full-text articles are provided by the publishers in electronic formats, it remains a challenge to find related work beyond the title and abstract context. Identifying related articles based on their abstract is indeed a good starting point; this process is straightforward and does not consume as many resources as full-text based similarity would require. However, further analyses may require in-depth understanding of the full content. Two articles with highly related abstracts can be substantially different regarding the full content. How similarity differs when considering title-and-abstract versus full-text and which semantic similarity metric provides better results when dealing with full-text articles are the main issues addressed in this manuscript.<h4>Methods</h4>We have benchmarked three similarity metrics - BM25, PMRA, and Cosine, in order to determine which one performs best when using concept-based annotations on full-text documents. We also evaluated variations in similarity values based on title-and-abstract against those relying on full-text. Our test dataset comprises the Genomics track article collection from the 2005 Text Retrieval Conference. Initially, we used an entity recognition software to semantically annotate titles and abstracts as well as full-text with concepts defined in the Unified Medical Language System (UMLSÆ). For each article, we created a document profile, i.e., a set of identified concepts, term frequency, and inverse document frequency; we then applied various similarity metrics to those document profiles. We considered correlation, precision, recall, and F1 in order to determine which similarity metric performs best with concept-based annotations. For those full-text articles available in PubMed Central Open Access (PMC-OA), we also performed dispersion analyses in order to understand how similarity varies when considering full-text articles.<h4>Results</h4>We have found that the PubMed Related Articles similarity metric is the most suitable for full-text articles annotated with UMLS concepts. For similarity values above 0.8, all metrics exhibited an F1 around 0.2 and a recall around 0.1; BM25 showed the highest precision close to 1; in all cases the concept-based metrics performed better than the word-stem-based one. Our experiments show that similarity values vary when considering only title-and-abstract versus full-text similarity. Therefore, analyses based on full-text become useful when a given research requires going beyond title and abstract, particularly regarding connectivity across articles.<h4>Availability</h4>Visualization available at ljgarcia.github.io/semsim.benchmark/, data available at http://dx.doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.13323.",0,data available at Zenodo
21208984,Model selection in Bayesian segmentation of multiple DNA alignments.,"<h4>Motivation</h4>The analysis of multiple sequence alignments is allowing researchers to glean valuable insights into evolution, as well as identify genomic regions that may be functional, or discover novel classes of functional elements. Understanding the distribution of conservation levels that constitutes the evolutionary landscape is crucial to distinguishing functional regions from non-functional. Recent evidence suggests that a binary classification of evolutionary rates is inappropriate for this purpose and finds only highly conserved functional elements. Given that the distribution of evolutionary rates is multi-modal, determining the number of modes is of paramount concern. Through simulation, we evaluate the performance of a number of information criterion approaches derived from MCMC simulations in determining the dimension of a model.<h4>Results</h4>We utilize a deviance information criterion (DIC) approximation that is more robust than the approximations from other information criteria, and show our information criteria approximations do not produce superfluous modes when estimating conservation distributions under a variety of circumstances. We analyse the distribution of conservation for a multiple alignment comprising four primate species and mouse, and repeat this on two additional multiple alignments of similar species. We find evidence of six distinct classes of evolutionary rates that appear to be robust to the species used.<h4>Availability</h4>Source code and data are available at http://dl.dropbox.com/u/477240/changept.zip.",0,data available but on dropbox

32440109,Proteome Profiling of Lung Tissues in Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (COPD): Platelet and Macrophage Dysfunction Contribute to the Pathogenesis of COPD.,"<h4>Purpose</h4>Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) is a worldwide public health challenge due to its high prevalence and related disability and mortality; however, the pathogenesis of COPD remains unclear. In this study, we aimed to identify key proteins involved in the pathogenesis of COPD.<h4>Patients and methods</h4>We collected lung tissue from three patients with COPD who required thoracic surgery for lung transplantation in the China-Japan Friendship Hospital. Lung tissue from three donors who had no history of lung disease <U+FEFF>was collected as healthy controls through a whole-body donation program of Peking Union Medical College (China). We conducted a proteomic analysis of the protein expression profiles in the two groups using a combination of high-resolution liquid chromatography coupled with tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) and quantitative 6-plex tandem mass tag-labeling; these data were validated by Western blot analysis.<h4>Results</h4>A total of 4976 proteins were identi<U+FB01>ed and analyzed, of which 173 were significantly changed (118 downregulated and 55 upregulated). Gene ontology analysis and protein-protein interaction networks demonstrated that the significantly changed proteins, especially downregulated proteins, were involved in platelet and macrophage activation. The mass spectrometry proteomics data have been deposited to the ProteomeXchange Consortium (http://proteomecentral.proteomexchange.org) via the iProX partner repository with the dataset identifier PXD017158.<h4>Conclusion</h4>In our study, GP6, PF4, and THBS1, which are associated with platelet activation and wound healing, were significantly downregulated in COPD patients. These results indicate that patients with COPD are more likely to develop hemostasis disorders, which could impede the repair process of the lung tissues. Moreover, downregulation of CD163, MARCO and VSIG4, which are involved in dysfunction of alveolar macrophages in efferocytosis, may inhibit the resolution of inflammation and contribute to the pathogenesis of COPD.",0,data deposited as referenced
28711973,PIWI-interacting RNAs as novel regulators of pancreatic beta cell function.,"<h4>Aims/hypothesis</h4>P-element induced Wimpy testis (PIWI)-interacting RNAs (piRNAs) are small non-coding RNAs that interact with PIWI proteins and guide them to silence transposable elements. They are abundantly expressed in germline cells and play key roles in spermatogenesis. There is mounting evidence that piRNAs are also present in somatic cells, where they may accomplish additional regulatory tasks. The aim of this study was to identify the piRNAs expressed in pancreatic islets and to determine whether they are involved in the control of beta cell activities.<h4>Methods</h4>piRNA profiling of rat pancreatic islets was performed by microarray analysis. The functions of piRNAs were investigated by silencing the two main Piwi genes or by modulating the level of selected piRNAs in islet cells.<h4>Results</h4>We detected about 18,000 piRNAs in rat pancreatic islets, many of which were differentially expressed throughout islet postnatal development. Moreover, we identified changes in the level of several piRNAs in the islets of Goto-Kakizaki rats, a well-established animal model of type 2 diabetes. Silencing of Piwil2 or Piwil4 genes in adult rat islets caused a reduction in the level of several piRNAs and resulted in defective insulin secretion and increased resistance of the cells to cytokine-induced cell death. Furthermore, overexpression in the islets of control animals of two piRNAs that are upregulated in diabetic rats led to a selective defect in glucose-induced insulin release.<h4>Conclusions/interpretation</h4>Our results provide evidence for a role of PIWI proteins and their associated piRNAs in the control of beta cell functions, and suggest a possible involvement in the development of type 2 diabetes.<h4>Data availability</h4>Data have been deposited in Gene Expression Omnibus repository under the accession number GSE93792.

25555998,Fiber estimation and tractography in diffusion MRI: development of simulated brain images and comparison of multi-fiber analysis methods at clinical b-values.,"Advances in diffusion-weighted magnetic resonance imaging (DW-MRI) have led to many alternative diffusion sampling strategies and analysis methodologies. A common objective among methods is estimation of white matter fiber orientations within each voxel, as doing so permits in-vivo fiber-tracking and the ability to study brain connectivity and networks. Knowledge of how DW-MRI sampling schemes affect fiber estimation accuracy, tractography and the ability to recover complex white-matter pathways, differences between results due to choice of analysis method, and which method(s) perform optimally for specific data sets, all remain important problems, especially as tractography-based studies become common. In this work, we begin to address these concerns by developing sets of simulated diffusion-weighted brain images which we then use to quantitatively evaluate the performance of six DW-MRI analysis methods in terms of estimated fiber orientation accuracy, false-positive (spurious) and false-negative (missing) fiber rates, and fiber-tracking. The analysis methods studied are: 1) a two-compartment ""ball and stick"" model (BSM) (Behrens et al., 2003); 2) a non-negativity constrained spherical deconvolution (CSD) approach (Tournier et al., 2007); 3) analytical q-ball imaging (QBI) (Descoteaux et al., 2007); 4) q-ball imaging with Funk-Radon and Cosine Transform (FRACT) (Haldar and Leahy, 2013); 5) q-ball imaging within constant solid angle (CSA) (Aganj et al., 2010); and 6) a generalized Fourier transform approach known as generalized q-sampling imaging (GQI) (Yeh et al., 2010). We investigate these methods using 20, 30, 40, 60, 90 and 120 evenly distributed q-space samples of a single shell, and focus on a signal-to-noise ratio (SNR = 18) and diffusion-weighting (b = 1000 s/mm(2)) common to clinical studies. We found that the BSM and CSD methods consistently yielded the least fiber orientation error and simultaneously greatest detection rate of fibers. Fiber detection rate was found to be the most distinguishing characteristic between the methods, and a significant factor for complete recovery of tractography through complex white-matter pathways. For example, while all methods recovered similar tractography of prominent white matter pathways of limited fiber crossing, CSD (which had the highest fiber detection rate, especially for voxels containing three fibers) recovered the greatest number of fibers and largest fraction of correct tractography for complex three-fiber crossing regions.

Consequently, important aspects of seamount ecology and dynamics remain poorly studied. We present a data collection of ocean currents and raw acoustic backscatter from shipboard Acoustic Doppler Current Profiler (ADCP) measurements during six cruises between 2004 and 2015 in the tropical and subtropical Northeast Atlantic to narrow this gap. Measurements were conducted at seamount locations between the island of Madeira and the Portuguese mainland (AmpËre, Seine Seamount), as well as east of the Cape Verde archipelago (Senghor Seamount).

27030549,The advantage of laser-capture microdissection over whole tissue analysis in proteomic profiling studies.,"Laser-capture microdissection (LCM) offers a reliable cell population enrichment tool and has been successfully coupled to MS analysis. Despite this, most proteomic studies employ whole tissue lysate (WTL) analysis in the discovery of disease biomarkers and in profiling analyses. Furthermore, the influence of tissue heterogeneity in WTL analysis, nor its impact in biomarker discovery studies have been completely elucidated. In order to address this, we compared previously obtained high resolution MS data from a cohort of 38 breast cancer tissues, of which both LCM enriched tumor epithelial cells and WTL samples were analyzed. Label-free quantification (LFQ) analysis through MaxQuant software showed a significantly higher number of identified and quantified proteins in LCM enriched samples (3404) compared to WTLs (2837). Furthermore, WTL samples displayed a higher amount of missing data compared to LCM both at peptide and protein levels (p-value < 0.001). 2D analysis on co-expressed proteins revealed discrepant expression of immune system and lipid metabolisms related proteins between LCM and WTL samples. We hereby show that LCM better dissected the biology of breast tumor epithelial cells, possibly due to lower interference from surrounding tissues and highly abundant proteins.

23504016,Genomic reconstruction of the transcriptional regulatory network in Bacillus subtilis.,"The adaptation of microorganisms to their environment is controlled by complex transcriptional regulatory networks (TRNs), which are still only partially understood even for model species. Genome scale annotation of regulatory features of genes and TRN reconstruction are challenging tasks of microbial genomics. We used the knowledge-driven comparative-genomics approach implemented in the RegPredict Web server to infer TRN in the model Gram-positive bacterium Bacillus subtilis and 10 related Bacillales species. For transcription factor (TF) regulons, we combined the available information from the DBTBS database and the literature with bioinformatics tools, allowing inference of TF binding sites (TFBSs), comparative analysis of the genomic context of predicted TFBSs, functional assignment of target genes, and effector prediction. For RNA regulons, we used known RNA regulatory motifs collected in the Rfam database to scan genomes and analyze the genomic context of new RNA sites. The inferred TRN in B. subtilis comprises regulons for 129 TFs and 24 regulatory RNA families. First, we analyzed 66 TF regulons with previously known TFBSs in B. subtilis and projected them to other Bacillales genomes, resulting in refinement of TFBS motifs and identification of novel regulon members. Second, we inferred motifs and described regulons for 28 experimentally studied TFs with previously unknown TFBSs. Third, we discovered novel motifs and reconstructed regulons for 36 previously uncharacterized TFs. The inferred collection of regulons is available in the RegPrecise database (http://regprecise.lbl.gov/) and can be used in genetic experiments, metabolic modeling, and evolutionary analysis.",0,data deposited as referenced
30832735,Ultrasound Elastography supplement assessing nodal status of magnetic resonance imaging staged cervical N0 patients with nasopharyngeal carcinoma.,"<h4>Background</h4>To determine whether ultrasound elastography can distinguish reactive or metastatic small lymph nodes (sLN) of magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) staged cervical N0 patients with nasopharyngeal carcinoma (NPC).<h4>Methods</h4>A pilot study was performed involving the diagnostic performances of conventional high-frequency ultrasound (CHFU) and/or shear wave elastography (SWE) for predicting metastases in sLN of MRI-staged N0 NPC patients with reference to the histologically-proven ultrasound guided core needle biopsy (US-CNB). The diagnosis of CHFU was based on the superficial lymph node ultrasonic criteria with the five-point-scale (FPS). The mean (Emean), minimum (Emin) and maximum (Emax) of the elasticity indices were measured by SWE at the stiffest part of the sLN in kilopascal. Diagnostic performances were analyzed using a receiver operating curve (ROC) on a per-node basis. The authenticity of this article has been validated by uploading the key raw data onto the Research Data Deposit public platform ( http://www.researchdata.org.cn ), with the approval RDD number as RDDA2017000447.<h4>Results</h4>All 113 cervical sLN of 49 MRI-staged cervical N0 NPC patients underwent evaluation of CHFU and SWE; 38 sLN (FPS < 2) were regarded as benign, which were excluded from subsequent analysis due to none biopsy-proven. And 75 indeterminate sLN (FPS†=†2) were referred to US-CNB and revealed 15 (20%) metastases. All SWE elastic indices were significantly higher in malignant sLNs than in benign sLNs (p†< 0.05). Moreover, Emax exhibited the highest diagnostic value (AUC:0.733 ± 0.067, p†= 0.005) with excellent measurement reproducibility (ICC: 0.786; 95%CI: 0.684, 0.864). CHFU plus SWE was superior to CHFU or SWE alone for predicting metastases in sLN of MRI-staged N0 patients with NPC (p†< 0.001).<h4>Conclusions</h4>CHFU plus SWE is an optional non-invasive modality to supplement MRI in assessing cervical nodal status of patients with NPC.",0,data deposited as referenced
IND604793137,"Re‚Äêevolution of a morphological precursor of crypsis investment in the newly revised horned praying mantises (Insecta, Mantodea, Vatinae)","The Neotropical praying mantis tribe Vatini StÂl is revised using total evidence phylogenetic analysis based on molecular and coded morphological data. The subfamily Vatinae is redefined to only include Neotropical taxa with the removal of distantly related African and Asian lineages. A new tribe is erected under Vatinae (Heterovatini trib.n.) for two unique genera with historically unstable taxonomic placement (Heterovates Saussure and Chopardiella Giglio-Tos). Phylogenetic results and morphology support the synonymy of three genera (Lobovates Deeleman-Reinhold, Phyllovates Kirby, and Hagiotata Saussure & Zehntner) and the validity of Chopardiella Giglio-Tos, Heterovates Saussure, Callivates Roy, Pseudovates Saussure, Vates Burmeister, and Zoolea Audinet Serville. A new genus (Alangularis gen.n.) is created for a former species of Vates with unique morphology and separate phylogenetic placement. All genera are redescribed based on external morphology and the male genital complex. A key to genera for Vatinae is provided with dorsal habitus images of representatives for each genus. A distinct pattern of correlated evolution of morphological characters linked to crypsis was uncovered. Cuticular leg lobes within single leg segments are evolving as sets, and serially homologous lobes appear simultaneously or in close succession. The posteroventral lobes in the apical position on thoracic femora appear to be the precursors to multiple positive rate shifts in the evolutionary accumulation of cryptic features. One shift occurred early in the evolution of Vatinae while the second occurred much later, after the loss and re-evolution of the posteroventral lobes in the apical position on thoracic femora, a violation of Dollo's law.

29630775,PR-10 proteins as potential mediators of melatonin-cytokinin cross-talk in plants: crystallographic studies of LlPR-10.2B isoform from yellow lupine.,"LlPR-10.2B, a Pathogenesis-related class 10 (PR-10) protein from yellow lupine (Lupinus luteus) was crystallized in complex with melatonin, an emerging important plant regulator and antioxidant. The structure reveals two molecules of melatonin bound in the internal cavity of the protein, plus a very well-defined electron density near the cavity entrance, corresponding to an unknown ligand molecule comprised of two flat rings, which is most likely a product of melatonin transformation. In a separate LlPR-10.2B co-crystallization experiment with an equimolar mixture of melatonin and trans-zeatin, which is a cytokinin phytohormone well recognized as a PR-10-binding partner, a quaternary 1 : 1 : 1 : 1 complex was formed, in which one of the melatonin-binding sites has been substituted with trans-zeatin, whereas the binding of melatonin at the second binding site and binding of the unknown ligand are undisturbed. This unusual complex, when compared with the previously described PR-10/trans-zeatin complexes and with the emerging structural information about melatonin binding by PR-10 proteins, provides intriguing insights into the role of PR-10 proteins in phytohormone regulation in plants, especially with the involvement of melatonin, and implicates the PR-10 proteins as low-affinity melatonin binders under the conditions of elevated melatonin concentration.

26484228,Whole transcriptome microarrays identify long non-coding RNAs associated with cardiac hypertrophy.,"Long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) have recently emerged as a novel group of non-coding RNAs able to regulate gene expression. While their role in cardiac disease is only starting to be understood, their involvement in cardiac hypertrophy is poorly known. We studied the association between lncRNAs and left ventricular hypertrophy using whole transcriptome microarrays. Wild-type mice and mice overexpressing the adenosine A2A receptor were subjected to transverse aortic constriction (TAC) to induce left ventricular hypertrophy. Expression profiles of lncRNAs in the heart were characterized using genome-wide microarrays. An analytical pipeline was specifically developed to extract lncRNA data from microarrays. We identified 2 lncRNAs up-regulated and 3 lncRNAs down-regulated in the hearts of A2A-receptor overexpressing-mice subjected to TAC compared to wild-type mice. Differential expression of these 2 lncRNAs was validated by quantitative PCR.

24259518,Quantitative proteomic profiling reveals novel region-specific markers in the adult mouse brain.,"Despite major advances in neuroscience, a comprehensive understanding of the structural and functional components of the adult brain compartments remains to be fully elucidated at a quantitative molecular level. Indeed, over half of the soluble- and membrane-annotated proteins are currently unmapped within online digital brain atlases. In this study, two complementary approaches were used to assess the unique repertoire of proteins enriched within select regions of the adult mouse CNS, including the brain stem, cerebellum, and remaining brain hemispheres. Of the 1200 proteins visualized by 2D-DIGE, approximately 150 (including cytosolic and membrane proteins) were found to exhibit statistically significant changes in relative abundance thus representing putative region-specific brain markers. In addition to using a high-precision (18) O-labeling strategy for the quantitative LC-MS/MS mapping of membrane proteins isolated from myelin-enriched fractions, we have identified over 1000 proteins that have yet to be described in any other mammalian myelin proteome. A comparison of our myelin proteome was made to an existing transcriptome database containing mRNA abundance profiles during oligodendrocyte differentiation and has confirmed statistically significant abundance changes for ~500 of these newly mapped proteins, thus revealing new roles in oligodendrocyte and myelin biology. These data offer a resource for the neuroscience community studying the molecular basis for specialized neuronal activities in the CNS and myelin-related disorders.

23362108,Epigenetic regulation of the X-linked tumour suppressors BEX1 and LDOC1 in oral squamous cell carcinoma.,"The strong associations between oral squamous cell carcinoma (OSCC) and dietary habits such as alcohol consumption (A), betel quid chewing (B) and cigarette smoking (C) and its predominance in men have been well documented; however, systemic analysis of OSCC is limited. Our study applied high-throughput screening methods to identify causative epigenetic targets in a cohort of men with ABC-associated OSCC. We identified BEX1 and LDOC1 as two epigenetically silenced X-linked tumour suppressors and demonstrated a functional link between the transcription of BEX1 and LDOC1 and promoter hypermethylation. Methylation of the BEX1 and LDOC1 promoters was associated significantly (p < 0.0001) with OSCC and were detected in 75% (42/56) and 89% (50/56) of the samples, respectively. We observed concordant increases in the methylation of both genes in 71% (40/56) of the tumours, and potent in vitro and in vivo growth inhibitory effects in OSCC cells ectopically expressing BEX1 and/or LDOC1. Restored expression of BEX1 and LDOC1 suppressed the nuclear factor-<U+03BA>B (NF-<U+03BA>B) signalling pathway, which is the most frequently hyperactivated signalling pathway in OSCC. This suppression might result from decreased p50 and p65 expression. These findings suggest that silencing of BEX1 and LDOC1 by promoter hypermethylation might represent a critical event in the molecular pathogenesis of OSCC and account for the oncogenic effects of ABC exposure and the male predominance of OSCC occurrence.

A partial loss of the mature phenotype of adult beta cells may contribute to a reduction of functional beta cell mass and accelerate the onset of type 2 diabetes. We previously found that fetuin-A, a hepatokine increasingly secreted by the fatty liver and a determinant of type 2 diabetes, inhibits glucose-stimulated insulin secretion (GSIS) of human islets. Since fetuin-A is a ubiquitous fetal glycoprotein that declines peripartum, we examined here whether fetuin-A interferes with the functional maturity of beta cells.<h4>Methods</h4>The effects of fetuin-A were assessed during in vitro maturation of porcine neonatal islet cell clusters (NICCs) and in adult human islets. Expression alterations were examined via microarray, RNA sequencing and reverse transcription quantitative real-time PCR (qRT-PCR), proteins were analysed by western blotting and immunostaining, and insulin secretion was quantified in static incubations.<h4>Results</h4>NICC maturation was accompanied by the gain of glucose-responsive insulin secretion (twofold stimulation), backed up by mRNA upregulation of genes governing beta cell identity and function, such as NEUROD1, UCN3, ABCC8 and CASR (Log<sub>2</sub> fold change [Log<sub>2</sub>FC] > 1.6). An active TGFﬂ receptor (TGFBR)-SMAD2/3 pathway facilitates NICC maturation, since the TGFBR inhibitor SB431542 counteracted the upregulation of aforementioned genes and de-repressed ALDOB, a gene disallowed in mature beta cells. In fetuin-A-treated NICCs, upregulation of beta cell markers and the onset of glucose responsiveness were suppressed. Concomitantly, SMAD2/3 phosphorylation was inhibited. Transcriptome analysis confirmed inhibitory effects of fetuin-A and SB431542 on TGFﬂ-1- and SMAD2/3-regulated transcription. However, contrary to SB431542 and regardless of cMYC upregulation, fetuin-A inhibited beta cell proliferation (0.27 ± 0.08% vs 1.0  ± 0.1% Ki67-positive cells in control NICCs). This effect was sustained by reduced expression (Log<sub>2</sub>FC = -2.4) of FOXM1, CENPA, CDK1 or TOP2A. In agreement, the number of insulin-positive cells was lower in fetuin-A-treated NICCs than in control NICCs (14.4 ± 1.2% and 22.3 ± 1.1%, respectively). In adult human islets fetuin-A abolished glucose responsiveness, i.e. 1.7- and 1.1-fold change over 2.8†mmol/l glucose in control- and fetuin-A-cultured islets, respectively. In addition, fetuin-A reduced SMAD2/3 phosphorylation and suppressed expression of proliferative genes. Of note, in non-diabetic humans, plasma fetuin-A was negatively correlated (p = 0.013) with islet beta cell area.<h4>Conclusions/interpretation</h4>Our results suggest that the perinatal decline of fetuin-A relieves TGFBR signalling in islets, a process that facilitates functional maturation of neonatal beta cells. Functional maturity remains revocable in later life, and the occurrence of a metabolically unhealthy milieu, such as liver steatosis and elevated plasma fetuin-A, can impair both function and adaptive proliferation of beta cells.<h4>Data availability</h4>The RNAseq datasets and computer code produced in this study are available in the Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO): GSE144950; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/query/acc.cgi?acc=GSE144950.",0,data deposited as referenced
32391909,Global ocean resistome revealed: Exploring antibiotic resistance gene abundance and distribution in TARA Oceans samples.,"<h4>Background</h4>The rise of antibiotic resistance (AR) in clinical settings is of great concern. Therefore, the understanding of AR mechanisms, evolution, and global distribution is a priority for patient survival. Despite all efforts in the elucidation of AR mechanisms in clinical strains, little is known about its prevalence and evolution in environmental microorganisms. We used 293 metagenomic samples from the TARA Oceans project to detect and quantify environmental antibiotic resistance genes (ARGs) using machine learning tools.<h4>Results</h4>After manual curation of ARGs, their abundance and distribution in the global ocean are presented. Additionally, the potential of horizontal ARG transfer by plasmids and their correlation with environmental and geographical parameters is shown. A total of 99,205 environmental open reading frames (ORFs) were classified as 1 of 560 different ARGs conferring resistance to 26 antibiotic classes. We found 24,567 ORFs in putative plasmid sequences, suggesting the importance of mobile genetic elements in the dynamics of environmental ARG transmission. Moreover, 4,804 contigs with >=2 putative ARGs were found, including 2 plasmid-like contigs with 5 different ARGs, highlighting the potential presence of multi-resistant microorganisms in the natural ocean environment. Finally, we identified ARGs conferring resistance to some of the most relevant clinical antibiotics, revealing the presence of 15 ARGs similar to mobilized colistin resistance genes (mcr) with high abundance on polar biomes. Of these, 5 are assigned to Psychrobacter, a genus including opportunistic human pathogens.<h4>Conclusions</h4>This study uncovers the diversity and abundance of ARGs in the global ocean metagenome. Our results are available on Zenodo in MySQL database dump format, and all the code used for the analyses, including a Jupyter notebook js avaliable on Github. We also developed a dashboard web application (http://www.resistomedb.com) for data visualization.",0,data deposited as referenced
24307635,Comparative proteomics reveals key proteins recruited at the nucleoid of Deinococcus after irradiation-induced DNA damage.,"The nucleoids of radiation-resistant Deinococcus species show a high degree of compaction maintained after ionizing irradiation. We identified proteins recruited after irradiation in nucleoids of Deinococcus radiodurans and Deinococcus deserti by means of comparative proteomics. Proteins in nucleoid-enriched fractions from unirradiated and irradiated Deinococcus were identified and semiquantified by shotgun proteomics. The ssDNA-binding protein SSB, DNA gyrase subunits GyrA and GyrB, DNA topoisomerase I, RecA recombinase, UvrA excinuclease, RecQ helicase, DdrA, DdrB, and DdrD proteins were found in significantly higher amounts in irradiated nucleoids of both Deinococcus species. We observed, by immunofluorescence microscopy, the subcellular localization of these proteins in D. radiodurans, showing for the first time the recruitment of the DdrD protein into the D. radiodurans nucleoid. We specifically followed the kinetics of recruitment of RecA, DdrA, and DdrD to the nucleoid after irradiation. Remarkably, RecA proteins formed irregular filament-like structures 1 h after irradiation, before being redistributed throughout the cells by 3 h post-irradiation. Comparable dynamics of DdrD localization were observed, suggesting a possible functional interaction between RecA and DdrD. Several proteins involved in nucleotide synthesis were also seen in higher quantities in the nucleoids of irradiated cells, indicative of the existence of a mechanism for orchestrating the presence of proteins involved in DNA metabolism in nucleoids in response to massive DNA damage.

25475896,Proteomic analysis of three Borrelia burgdorferi sensu lato native species and disseminating clones: relevance for Lyme vaccine design.,"Lyme borreliosis is the most important vector-borne disease in the Northern hemisphere. It is caused by Borrelia burgdorferi sensu lato bacteria transmitted to humans by the bite of hard ticks, Ixodes spp. Although antibiotic treatments are efficient in the early stage of the infection, a significant number of patients develop disseminated manifestations (articular, neurological, and cutaneous) due to unnoticed or absence of erythema migrans, or to inappropriate treatment. Vaccine could be an efficient approach to decrease Lyme disease incidence. We have developed a proteomic approach based on a one dimensional gel electrophoresis followed by LC-MS/MS strategy to identify new vaccine candidates. We analyzed a disseminating clone and the associated wild-type strain for each major pathogenic Borrelia species: B. burgdorferi sensu stricto, B. garinii, and B. afzelii. We identified specific proteins and common proteins to the disseminating clones of the three main species. In parallel, we used a spectral counting strategy to identify upregulated proteins common to the clones. Finally, 40 proteins were found that could potentially be involved in bacterial virulence and of interest in the development of a new vaccine. We selected the three proteins specifically detected in the disseminating clones of the three Borrelia species and checked by RT-PCR whether they are expressed in mouse skin upon B. burgdorferi ss inoculation. Interestingly, BB0566 appears as a potential vaccine candidate.

30457571,Generation and quality control of lipidomics data for the alzheimer's disease neuroimaging initiative cohort.,"Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a major public health priority with a large socioeconomic burden and complex etiology. The Alzheimer Disease Metabolomics Consortium (ADMC) and the Alzheimer Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) aim to gain new biological insights in the disease etiology. We report here an untargeted lipidomics of serum specimens of 806 subjects within the ADNI1 cohort (188 AD, 392 mild cognitive impairment and 226 cognitively normal subjects) along with 83 quality control samples. Lipids were detected and measured using an ultra-high-performance liquid chromatography quadruple/time-of-flight mass spectrometry (UHPLC-QTOF MS) instrument operated in both negative and positive electrospray ionization modes. The dataset includes a total 513 unique lipid species out of which 341 are known lipids. For over 95% of the detected lipids, a relative standard deviation of better than 20% was achieved in the quality control samples, indicating high technical reproducibility. Association modeling of this dataset and available clinical, metabolomics and drug-use data will provide novel insights into the AD etiology.

27660521,AxIOM: Amphipod crustaceans from insular Posidonia oceanica seagrass meadows.,"<h4>Background</h4>The Neptune grass, Posidonia oceanica (L.) Delile, 1813, is the most widespread seagrass of the Mediterranean Sea. This foundation species forms large meadows that, through habitat and trophic services, act as biodiversity hotspots. In Neptune grass meadows, amphipod crustaceans are one of the dominant groups of vagile invertebrates, forming an abundant and diverse taxocenosis. They are key ecological components of the complex, pivotal, yet critically endangered Neptune grass ecosystems. Nevertheless, comprehensive qualitative and quantitative data about amphipod fauna found in Mediterranean Neptune grass meadows remain scarce, especially in insular locations.<h4>New information</h4>Here, we provide in-depth metadata about AxIOM, a sample-based dataset published on the GBIF portal. AxIOM is based on an extensive and spatially hierarchized sampling design with multiple years, seasons, day periods, and methods. Samples were taken along the coasts of Calvi Bay (Corsica, France) and of the Tavolara-Punta Coda Cavallo Marine Protected Area (Sardinia, Italy). In total, AxIOM contains 187 samples documenting occurrence (1775 records) and abundance (10720 specimens) of amphipod crustaceans belonging to 72 species spanning 29 families.

25871442,Monitoring matrix metalloproteinase activity at the epidermal-dermal interface by SILAC-iTRAQ-TAILS.,"Secreted proteases act on interstitial tissue secretomes released from multiple cell types. Thus, substrate proteins might be part of higher molecular complexes constituted by many proteins with diverse and potentially unknown cellular origin. In cell culture, these may be reconstituted by mixing native secretomes from different cell types prior to incubation with a test protease. Although current degradomics techniques could identify novel substrate proteins in these complexes, all information on the cellular origin is lost. To address this limitation, we combined iTRAQ-based terminal amine isotopic labeling of substrates (iTRAQ-TAILS) with SILAC to assign proteins to a specific cell type by MS1- and their cleavage by MS2-based quantification in the same experiment. We demonstrate the power of our newly established workflow by monitoring matrix metalloproteinase (MMP) 10 dependent cleavages in mixtures from light-labeled keratinocyte and heavy-labeled fibroblast secretomes. This analysis correctly assigned extracellular matrix components, such as laminins and collagens, to their respective cellular origins and revealed their processing in an MMP10-dependent manner. Hence, our newly devised degradomics workflow facilitates deeper insight into protease activity in complex intercellular compartments such as the epidermal-dermal interface by integrating multiple modes of quantification with positional proteomics.

34330087,ARTS: A novel In-vivo classifier of arteriolosclerosis for the older adult brain.,"Brain arteriolosclerosis, one of the main pathologies of cerebral small vessel disease, is common in older adults and has been linked to lower cognitive and motor function and higher odds of dementia. In spite of its frequency and associated morbidity, arteriolosclerosis can only be diagnosed at autopsy. Therefore, the purpose of this work was to develop an in-vivo classifier of arteriolosclerosis based on brain MRI. First, an ex-vivo classifier of arteriolosclerosis was developed based on features related to white matter hyperintensities, diffusion anisotropy and demographics by applying machine learning to ex-vivo MRI and pathology data from 119 participants of the Rush Memory and Aging Project (MAP) and Religious Orders Study (ROS), two longitudinal cohort studies of aging that recruit non-demented older adults. The ex-vivo classifier showed good performance in predicting the presence of arteriolosclerosis, with an average area under the receiver operating characteristic curve AUC†=†0.78. The ex-vivo classifier was then translated to in-vivo based on available in-vivo and ex-vivo MRI data on the same participants. The in-vivo classifier was named ARTS (short for ARTerioloSclerosis), is fully automated, and provides a score linked to the likelihood a person suffers from arteriolosclerosis. The performance of ARTS in predicting the presence of arteriolosclerosis in-vivo was tested in a separate, 91% dementia-free group of 79 MAP/ROS participants and exhibited an AUC†=†0.79 in persons with antemortem intervals shorter than 2.4†years. This level of performance in mostly non-demented older adults is notable considering that arteriolosclerosis can only be diagnosed at autopsy. The scan-rescan reproducibility of the ARTS score was excellent, with an intraclass correlation of 0.99, suggesting that application of ARTS in longitudinal studies may show high sensitivity in detecting small changes. Finally, higher ARTS scores in non-demented older adults were associated with greater decline in cognition two years after baseline MRI, especially in perceptual speed which has been linked to arteriolosclerosis and small vessel disease. This finding was shown in a separate group of 369 non-demented MAP/ROS participants and was validated in 72 non-demented Black participants of the Minority Aging Research Study (MARS) and also in 244 non-demented participants of the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative 2 and 3. The results of this work suggest that ARTS may have broad implications in the advancement of diagnosis, prevention and treatment of arteriolosclerosis.

32685640,Lipid profile dataset of optogenetics induced optic nerve regeneration.,"The optic nerve transfers visual information from the retina to the brain through the axons of retinal ganglion cells (RGCs). In adult mammals, optic nerve injuries and progressive degenerative diseases lead to the irreversible loss of RGCs, resulting in vision loss and blindness. Optogenetic models have proved useful in manipulating the growth of RGCs through expression and stimulation of channelrhodopsins (Chr2) in RGCs using the RGC-specific thy-1 promoter. Using transgenic Chr2 mouse (Thy1-ChR2-EYFP) as a model of regeneration, we profile the lipid changes which occur after traumatic optic nerve crush, light stimulation and forced RGC axonal growth. Thy1-ChR2-EYFP and control (C57BL/6) mice were divided in four groups each - 1) no crush and no stimulation, 2) no crush with stimulation, 3) crush and without stimulation, and 4) crush with stimulation. After euthanasia, the optic nerves were collected for lipidomic analysis. The Bligh and Dyer method was used for lipid extraction, followed by mass spectrometry lipid profiling with a Q-Exactive Orbitrap Liquid Chromatography-Mass Spectrometer (LC MS-MS). The raw scans were analysed with LipidSearch 4.1.3 and the statistical analysis was conducted through Metaboanalyst 4.0.

31168931,Proteome Dataset of Qualea grandiflora Mart. (Vochysiaceae) by LC-MS/MS Label-Free Identification in Response to Aluminum.,"This dataset brief is about the descriptive proteome of Qualea grandiflora plants by label free mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS). Q. grandiflora is a plant that accumulates aluminum (Al) in high quantities and requires it for growth and development. Although quite relevant for the understanding of Al effects on plants, the proteome of Q. grandiflora has not been studied yet. Therefore, the current proteome analysis identifies a total of 2010 proteins. Furthermore, the identified Q. grandiflora root proteins are associated with several crucial molecular functions, biological processes, and cellular sites. Hence, the proteome analysis of Q. grandiflora will contribute to unravel how plants evolved to cope with high levels of Al in soils.

31301205,The Generation of a Comprehensive Spectral Library for the Analysis of the Guinea Pig Proteome by SWATH-MS.,"Advances in liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry have facilitated the incorporation of proteomic studies to many biology experimental workflows. Data-independent acquisition platforms, such as sequential window acquisition of all theoretical mass spectra (SWATH-MS), offer several advantages for label-free quantitative assessment of complex proteomes over data-dependent acquisition (DDA) approaches. However, SWATH data interpretation requires spectral libraries as a detailed reference resource. The guinea pig (Cavia porcellus) is an excellent experimental model for translation to many aspects of human physiology and disease, yet there is limited experimental information regarding its proteome. To overcome this knowledge gap, a comprehensive spectral library of the guinea pig proteome is generated. Homogenates and tryptic digests are prepared from 16 tissues and subjected to >200 DDA runs. Analysis of >250†000 peptide-spectrum matches resulted in a library of 73†594 peptides from 7666 proteins. Library validation is provided by i) analyzing externally derived SWATH files (https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jprot.2018.03.023) and comparing peptide intensity quantifications; ii) merging of externally derived data to the base library. This furnishes the research community with a comprehensive proteomic resource that will facilitate future molecular-phenotypic studies using (re-engaging) the guinea pig as an experimental model of relevance to human biology.

31921518,A transcriptomic study of probenecid on injured spinal cords in mice.,"Background:Recent studies have found that probenecid has neuroprotective and reparative effects on central nervous system injuries. However, its effect on genome-wide transcription in acute spinal cord injury (SCI) remains unknown. In the present study, RNA sequencing (RNA-Seq) is used to analyze the effect of probenecid on the local expression of gene transcription 8 h after spinal injury. Methods:An Infinite Horizon impactor was used to perform contusive SCI in mice. The SCI model was made by using a rod (1.3 mm diameter) with a force of 50 Kdynes. Sham-operated mice only received a laminectomy without contusive injury. The injured mice were randomly assigned into either the control (SCI_C) or probenecid injection (SCI_P) group. In the latter group, the probenecid drug was intraperitoneally injected (0.5 mg/kg) immediately following injury. Eight hours after the injury or laminectomy, the spinal cords were removed from the mice in both groups. The total RNAs were extracted and purified for library preparation and transcriptome sequencing. Differential gene expressions (DEGs) of the three groups-sham, SCI_C and SCI_P-were analyzed using a DESeq software. Gene Ontology (GO) and Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) enrichment analysis of DEGs were performed using a GOseq R package and KOBAS software. Real-time quantitative reverse-transcriptase polymerase chain reaction was used to validate RNA-Seq results. Results:RNA-Seq showed that, compared to the SCI_C group, the number of DEGs was 641 in the SCI_P group (286 upregulated and 355 downregulated). According to GO analysis, DEGs were most enriched in extracellular matrix (ECM), collagen trimer, protein bounding and sequence specific DNA binding. KEGG analysis showed that the most enriched pathways included: cell adhesion molecules, Leukocyte transendothelial migration, ECM-receptor interactions, PI3K-Akt signaling pathways, hematopoietic cell lineages, focal adhesions, the Rap1 signaling pathway, etc. The sequence data have been deposited into the Sequence Read Archive (https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/sra/PRJNA554464).",0,data deposited as referenced
32043185,Metabolic alterations in immune cells associate with progression to type 1 diabetes.,"<h4>Aims/hypothesis</h4>Previous metabolomics studies suggest that type 1 diabetes is preceded by specific metabolic disturbances. The aim of this study was to investigate whether distinct metabolic patterns occur in peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) of children who later develop pancreatic beta cell autoimmunity or overt type 1 diabetes.<h4>Methods</h4>In a longitudinal cohort setting, PBMC metabolomic analysis was applied in children who (1) progressed to type 1 diabetes (PT1D, n = 34), (2) seroconverted to =1 islet autoantibody without progressing to type 1 diabetes (P1Ab, n = 27) or (3) remained autoantibody negative during follow-up (CTRL, n = 10).<h4>Results</h4>During the first year of life, levels of most lipids and polar metabolites were lower in the PT1D and P1Ab groups compared with the CTRL group. Pathway over-representation analysis suggested alanine, aspartate, glutamate, glycerophospholipid and sphingolipid metabolism were over-represented in PT1D. Genome-scale metabolic models of PBMCs during type 1 diabetes progression were developed by using publicly available transcriptomics data and constrained with metabolomics data from our study. Metabolic modelling confirmed altered ceramide pathways, known to play an important role in immune regulation, as specifically associated with type 1 diabetes progression.<h4>Conclusions/interpretation</h4>Our data suggest that systemic dysregulation of lipid metabolism, as observed in plasma, may impact the metabolism and function of immune cells during progression to overt type 1 diabetes.<h4>Data availability</h4>The GEMs for PBMCs have been submitted to BioModels (www.ebi.ac.uk/biomodels/), under accession number MODEL1905270001.

28462382,GATA4 Is Sufficient to Establish Jejunal Versus Ileal Identity in the Small Intestine.,"<h4>Background & aims</h4>Patterning of the small intestinal epithelium along its cephalocaudal axis establishes three functionally distinct regions: duodenum, jejunum, and ileum. Efficient nutrient assimilation and growth depend on the proper spatial patterning of specialized digestive and absorptive functions performed by duodenal, jejunal, and ileal enterocytes. When enterocyte function is disrupted by disease or injury, intestinal failure can occur. One approach to alleviate intestinal failure would be to restore lost enterocyte functions. The molecular mechanisms determining regionally defined enterocyte functions, however, are poorly delineated. We previously showed that GATA binding protein 4 (GATA4) is essential to define jejunal enterocytes. The goal of this study was to test the hypothesis that GATA4 is sufficient to confer jejunal identity within the intestinal epithelium.<h4>Methods</h4>To test this hypothesis, we generated a novel <i>Gata4</i> conditional knock-in mouse line and expressed GATA4 in the ileum, where it is absent.<h4>Results</h4>We found that GATA4-expressing ileum lost ileal identity. The global gene expression profile of GATA4-expressing ileal epithelium aligned more closely with jejunum and duodenum rather than ileum. Focusing on jejunal vs ileal identity, we defined sets of jejunal and ileal genes likely to be regulated directly by GATA4 to suppress ileal identity and promote jejunal identity. Furthermore, our study implicates GATA4 as a transcriptional repressor of <i>fibroblast growth factor 15 (Fgf15)</i>, which encodes an enterokine that has been implicated in an increasing number of human diseases.<h4>Conclusions</h4>Overall, this study refines our understanding of an important GATA4-dependent molecular mechanism to pattern the intestinal epithelium along its cephalocaudal axis by elaborating on GATA4's function as a crucial dominant molecular determinant of jejunal enterocyte identity.

29524011,HIVprotI: an integrated web based platform for prediction and design of HIV proteins inhibitors.,"A number of anti-retroviral drugs are being used for treating Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV) infection. Due to emergence of drug resistant strains, there is a constant quest to discover more effective anti-HIV compounds. In this endeavor, computational tools have proven useful in accelerating drug discovery. Although methods were published to design a class of compounds against a specific HIV protein, but an integrated web server for the same is lacking. Therefore, we have developed support vector machine based regression models using experimentally validated data from ChEMBL repository. Quantitative structure activity relationship based features were selected for predicting inhibition activity of a compound against HIV proteins namely protease (PR), reverse transcriptase (RT) and integrase (IN). The models presented a maximum Pearson correlation coefficient of 0.78, 0.76, 0.74 and 0.76, 0.68, 0.72 during tenfold cross-validation on IC50 and percent inhibition datasets of PR, RT, IN respectively. These models performed equally well on the independent datasets. Chemical space mapping, applicability domain analyses and other statistical tests further support robustness of the predictive models. Currently, we have identified a number of chemical descriptors that are imperative in predicting the compound inhibition potential.

24467687,Non-synonymous variations in cancer and their effects on the human proteome: workflow for NGS data biocuration and proteome-wide analysis of TCGA data.,"<h4>Background</h4>Next-generation sequencing (NGS) technologies have resulted in petabytes of scattered data, decentralized in archives, databases and sometimes in isolated hard-disks which are inaccessible for browsing and analysis. It is expected that curated secondary databases will help organize some of this Big Data thereby allowing users better navigate, search and compute on it.<h4>Results</h4>To address the above challenge, we have implemented a NGS biocuration workflow and are analyzing short read sequences and associated metadata from cancer patients to better understand the human variome. Curation of variation and other related information from control (normal tissue) and case (tumor) samples will provide comprehensive background information that can be used in genomic medicine research and application studies. Our approach includes a CloudBioLinux Virtual Machine which is used upstream of an integrated High-performance Integrated Virtual Environment (HIVE) that encapsulates Curated Short Read archive (CSR) and a proteome-wide variation effect analysis tool (SNVDis). As a proof-of-concept, we have curated and analyzed control and case breast cancer datasets from the NCI cancer genomics program - The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA). Our efforts include reviewing and recording in CSR available clinical information on patients, mapping of the reads to the reference followed by identification of non-synonymous Single Nucleotide Variations (nsSNVs) and integrating the data with tools that allow analysis of effect nsSNVs on the human proteome. Furthermore, we have also developed a novel phylogenetic analysis algorithm that uses SNV positions and can be used to classify the patient population. The workflow described here lays the foundation for analysis of short read sequence data to identify rare and novel SNVs that are not present in dbSNP and therefore provides a more comprehensive understanding of the human variome. Variation results for single genes as well as the entire study are available from the CSR website (http://hive.biochemistry.gwu.edu/dna.cgi?cmd=csr).<h4>Conclusions</h4>Availability of thousands of sequenced samples from patients provides a rich repository of sequence information that can be utilized to identify individual level SNVs and their effect on the human proteome beyond what the dbSNP database provides.",1,database but password protected

29270816,"Arctic berry extracts target the gut-liver axis to alleviate metabolic endotoxaemia, insulin resistance and hepatic steatosis in diet-induced obese mice.","<h4>Aims/hypothesis</h4>There is growing evidence that fruit polyphenols exert beneficial effects on the metabolic syndrome, but the underlying mechanisms remain poorly understood. In the present study, we aimed to analyse the effects of polyphenolic extracts from five types of Arctic berries in a model of diet-induced obesity.<h4>Methods</h4>Male C57BL/6†J mice were fed a high-fat/high-sucrose (HFHS) diet and orally treated with extracts of bog blueberry (BBE), cloudberry (CLE), crowberry (CRE), alpine bearberry (ABE), lingonberry (LGE) or vehicle (HFHS) for 8†weeks. An additional group of standard-chow-fed, vehicle-treated mice was included as a reference control for diet-induced obesity. OGTTs and insulin tolerance tests were conducted, and both plasma insulin and C-peptide were assessed throughout the OGTT. Quantitative PCR, western blot analysis and ELISAs were used to assess enterohepatic immunometabolic features. Faecal DNA was extracted and 16S rRNA gene-based analysis was used to profile the gut microbiota.<h4>Results</h4>Treatment with CLE, ABE and LGE, but not with BBE or CRE, prevented both fasting hyperinsulinaemia (mean ± SEM [pmol/l]: chow 67.2 ± 12.3, HFHS 153.9 ± 19.3, BBE 114.4 ± 14.3, CLE 82.5 ± 13.0, CRE 152.3 ± 24.4, ABE 90.6 ± 18.0, LGE 95.4 ± 10.5) and postprandial hyperinsulinaemia (mean ± SEM AUC [pmol/l ◊ min]: chow 14.3 ± 1.4, HFHS 31.4 ± 3.1, BBE 27.2 ± 4.0, CLE 17.7 ± 2.2, CRE 32.6 ± 6.3, ABE 22.7 ± 18.0, LGE 23.9 ± 2.5). None of the berry extracts affected C-peptide levels or body weight gain. Levels of hepatic serine phosphorylated Akt were 1.6-, 1.5- and 1.2-fold higher with CLE, ABE and LGE treatment, respectively, and hepatic carcinoembryonic antigen-related cell adhesion molecule (CEACAM)-1 tyrosine phosphorylation was 0.6-, 0.7- and 0.9-fold increased in these mice vs vehicle-treated, HFHS-fed mice. These changes were associated with reduced liver triacylglycerol deposition, lower circulating endotoxins, alleviated hepatic and intestinal inflammation, and major gut microbial alterations (e.g. bloom of Akkermansia muciniphila, Turicibacter and Oscillibacter) in CLE-, ABE- and LGE-treated mice.<h4>Conclusions/interpretation</h4>Our findings reveal novel mechanisms by which polyphenolic extracts from ABE, LGE and especially CLE target the gut-liver axis to protect diet-induced obese mice against metabolic endotoxaemia, insulin resistance and hepatic steatosis, which importantly improves hepatic insulin clearance. These results support the potential benefits of these Arctic berries and their integration into health programmes to help attenuate obesity-related chronic inflammation and metabolic disorders.<h4>Data availability</h4>All raw sequences have been deposited in the public European Nucleotide Archive server under accession number PRJEB19783 ( https://www.ebi.ac.uk/ena/data/view/PRJEB19783 ).",0,deposited data
31031918,Future temperature and salinity do not exert selection pressure on cyst germination of a toxic phytoplankton species.,"Environmental conditions regulate the germination of phytoplankton resting stages. While some factors lead to synchronous germination, others stimulate germination of only a small fraction of the resting stages. This suggests that habitat filters may act on the germination level and thus affect selection of blooming strains. Benthic ""seed banks"" of the toxic dinoflagellate <i>Alexandrium ostenfeldii</i> from the Baltic Sea are genetically and phenotypically diverse, indicating a high potential for adaptation by selection on standing genetic variation. Here, we experimentally tested the role of climate-related salinity and temperature as selection filters during germination and subsequent establishment of <i>A.†ostenfeldii</i> strains. A representative resting cyst population was isolated from sediment samples, and germination and reciprocal transplantation experiments were carried out, including four treatments: Average present day germination conditions and three potential future conditions: high temperature, low salinity, and high temperature in combination with low salinity. We found that the final germination success of <i>A.†ostenfeldii</i> resting cysts was unaffected by temperature and salinity in the range tested. A high germination success of more than 80% in all treatments indicates that strains are not selected by temperature and salinity during germination, but selection becomes more important shortly after germination, in the vegetative stage of the life cycle. Moreover, strains were not adapted to germination conditions. Instead, highly plastic responses occurred after transplantation and significantly higher growth rates were observed at higher temperature. High variability of strain-specific responses has probably masked the overall effect of the treatments, highlighting the importance of testing the effect of environmental factors on many strains. It is likely that <i>A.†ostenfeldii</i> populations can persist in the future, because suitable strains, which are able to germinate and grow well at potential future climate conditions, are part of the highly diverse cyst population.<h4>Open research badges</h4>This article has earned an Open Data Badge for making publicly available the digitally-shareable data necessary to reproduce the reported results.

21624157,How orthogonal are the OBO Foundry ontologies?,"<h4>Background</h4>Ontologies in biomedicine facilitate information integration, data exchange, search and query of biomedical data, and other critical knowledge-intensive tasks. The OBO Foundry is a collaborative effort to establish a set of principles for ontology development with the eventual goal of creating a set of interoperable reference ontologies in the domain of biomedicine. One of the key requirements to achieve this goal is to ensure that ontology developers reuse term definitions that others have already created rather than create their own definitions, thereby making the ontologies orthogonal.<h4>Methods</h4>We used a simple lexical algorithm to analyze the extent to which the set of OBO Foundry candidate ontologies identified from September 2009 to September 2010 conforms to this vision. Specifically, we analyzed (1) the level of explicit term reuse in this set of ontologies, (2) the level of overlap, where two ontologies define similar terms independently, and (3) how the levels of reuse and overlap changed during the course of this year.<h4>Results</h4>We found that 30% of the ontologies reuse terms from other Foundry candidates and 96% of the candidate ontologies contain terms that overlap with terms from the other ontologies. We found that while term reuse increased among the ontologies between September 2009 and September 2010, the level of overlap among the ontologies remained relatively constant. Additionally, we analyzed the six ontologies announced as OBO Foundry members on March 5, 2010, and identified that the level of overlap was extremely low, but, notably, so was the level of term reuse.<h4>Conclusions</h4>We have created a prototype web application that allows OBO Foundry ontology developers to see which classes from their ontologies overlap with classes from other ontologies in the OBO Foundry (http://obomap.bioontology.org). From our analysis, we conclude that while the OBO Foundry has made significant progress toward orthogonality during the period of this study through increased adoption of explicit term reuse, a large amount of overlap remains among these ontologies. Furthermore, the characteristics of the identified overlap, such as the terms it comprises and its distribution among the ontologies, indicate that the achieving orthogonality will be exceptionally difficult, if not impossible.",0,for analysis only it seems

32110491,DISNET: a framework for extracting phenotypic disease information from public sources.,"Background:Within the global endeavour of improving population health, one major challenge is the identification and integration of medical knowledge spread through several information sources. The creation of a comprehensive dataset of diseases and their clinical manifestations based on information from public sources is an interesting approach that allows one not only to complement and merge medical knowledge but also to increase it and thereby to interconnect existing data and analyse and relate diseases to each other. In this paper, we present DISNET (http://disnet.ctb.upm.es/), a web-based system designed to periodically extract the knowledge from signs and symptoms retrieved from medical databases, and to enable the creation of customisable disease networks. Methods:We here present the main features of the DISNET system. We describe how information on diseases and their phenotypic manifestations is extracted from Wikipedia and PubMed websites; specifically, texts from these sources are processed through a combination of text mining and natural language processing techniques. Results:We further present the validation of our system on Wikipedia and PubMed texts, obtaining the relevant accuracy. The final output includes the creation of a comprehensive symptoms-disease dataset, shared (free access) through the system's API. We finally describe, with some simple use cases, how a user can interact with it and extract information that could be used for subsequent analyses. Discussion:DISNET allows retrieving knowledge about the signs, symptoms and diagnostic tests associated with a disease. It is not limited to a specific category (all the categories that the selected sources of information offer us) and clinical diagnosis terms. It further allows to track the evolution of those terms through time, being thus an opportunity to analyse and observe the progress of human knowledge on diseases. We further discussed the validation of the system, suggesting that it is good enough to be used to extract diseases and diagnostically-relevant terms. At the same time, the evaluation also revealed that improvements could be introduced to enhance the system's reliability.",0,"good, but too clinical I think"

Findings from analyses of whole-genome sequences show great promise for informing strategies to mitigate risks from diseases caused by phytopathogens. Genomic approaches can be used to dramatically shorten response times to outbreaks and inform disease management in novel ways. However, the use of these approaches requires expertise in working with big, complex data sets and an understanding of their pitfalls and limitations to infer well-supported conclusions. We suggest using an evolutionary framework to guide the use of genomic approaches in epidemiology and diagnostics of plant pathogens.

27350137,Analysis of Transitional and Turbulent Flow Through the FDA Benchmark Nozzle Model Using Laser Doppler Velocimetry.,"Transitional and turbulent flow through a simplified medical device model is analyzed as part of the FDA's Critical Path Initiative, designed to improve the process of bringing medical products to market. Computational predictions are often used in the development of devices and reliable in vitro data is needed to validate computational results, particularly estimations of the Reynolds stresses that could play a role in damaging blood elements. The high spatial resolution of laser Doppler velocimetry (LDV) is used to collect two component velocity data within the FDA benchmark nozzle model. Two flow conditions are used to produce flow encompassing laminar, transitional, and turbulent regimes, and viscous stresses, principal Reynolds stresses, and turbulence intensities are calculated from the measured LDV velocities. Axial velocities and viscous stresses are compared to data from a prior inter-laboratory study conducted with particle image velocimetry. Large velocity gradients are observed near the wall in the nozzle throat and in the jet shear layer located in the expansion downstream of the throat, with axial velocity changing as much as 4.5†m/s over 200†µm. Additionally, maximum Reynolds shear stresses of 1000-2000†Pa are calculated in the high shear regions, which are an order of magnitude higher than the peak viscous shear stresses (<100†Pa). It is important to consider the effects of both viscous and turbulent stresses when simulating flow through medical devices. Reynolds stresses above commonly accepted hemolysis thresholds are measured in the nozzle model, indicating that hemolysis may occur under certain flow conditions. As such, the presented turbulence quantities from LDV, which are also available for download at https://fdacfd.nci.nih.gov/ , provide an ideal validation test for computational simulations that seek to characterize the flow field and to predict hemolysis within the FDA nozzle geometry.",1,iffy

29990255,Meta-Path Methods for Prioritizing Candidate Disease miRNAs.,"MicroRNAs (miRNAs) play critical roles in regulating gene expression at post-transcriptional levels. Numerous experimental studies indicate that alterations and dysregulations in miRNAs are associated with important complex diseases, especially cancers. Predicting potential miRNA-disease association is beneficial not only to explore the pathogenesis of diseases, but also to understand biological processes. In this work, we propose two methods that can effectively predict potential miRNA-disease associations using our reconstructed miRNA and disease similarity networks, which are based on the latest experimental data. We reconstruct a miRNA functional similarity network using the following biological information: the miRNA family information, miRNA cluster information, experimentally valid miRNA-target association and disease-miRNA information. We also reconstruct a disease similarity network using disease functional information and disease semantic information. We present Katz with specific weights and Katz with machine learning, on the comprehensive heterogeneous network. These methods, which achieve corresponding AUC values of 0.897 and 0.919, exhibit performance superior to the existing methods. Comprehensive data networks and reasonable considerations guarantee the high performance of our methods.

32277449,Choice of the Promoter for Tissue and Developmental Stage-Specific Gene Expression.,"Transgenic technologies belong to important tools of reverse genetics and biotechnology in plants. Targeted genetic modifications can reveal functions of genes of interest, change metabolic and regulatory pathways, or result in accumulation of valuable proteins or metabolites. However, to be efficient in targeted genetic modification, the chimeric gene construct should be designed properly. In particular, the promoters used to control transgene expression need to be carefully chosen. Most promoters in widely used vectors belong to strong and constitutively expressed variants. However, in many cases transgene expression has to be restricted to certain tissue, stage of development, or response to some internal or external stimuli. In turn, a large variety of tissue-specific promoters have been studied and information on their characteristics may be recovered from the literature. An appropriate promoter may be selected and used in genetic construct to optimize the transgene transcription pattern. We have previously designed the TGP database (TransGene Promoters, http://wwwmgs.bionet.nsc.ru/mgs/dbases/tgp/home.html ) collecting information from the publications in this field.

23368677,Identifying cross-category relations in gene ontology and constructing genome-specific term association networks.,"<h4>Background</h4>Gene Ontology (GO) has been widely used in biological databases, annotation projects, and computational analyses. Although the three GO categories are structured as independent ontologies, the biological relationships across the categories are not negligible for biological reasoning and knowledge integration. However, the existing cross-category ontology term similarity measures are either developed by utilizing the GO data only or based on manually curated term name similarities, ignoring the fact that GO is evolving quickly and the gene annotations are far from complete.<h4>Results</h4>In this paper we introduce a new cross-category similarity measurement called CroGO by incorporating genome-specific gene co-function network data. The performance study showed that our measurement outperforms the existing algorithms. We also generated genome-specific term association networks for yeast and human. An enrichment based test showed our networks are better than those generated by the other measures.<h4>Conclusions</h4>The genome-specific term association networks constructed using CroGO provided a platform to enable a more consistent use of GO. In the networks, the frequently occurred MF-centered hub indicates that a molecular function may be shared by different genes in multiple biological processes, or a set of genes with the same functions may participate in distinct biological processes. And common subgraphs in multiple organisms also revealed conserved GO term relationships. Software and data are available online at http://www.msu.edu/~jinchen/CroGO.",0,iffy

Here, we report H-DROP, an SVM-based Helical Domain linker pRediction using OPtimal features. H-DROP is, to the best of our knowledge, the first predictor for specifically and effectively identifying helical linkers. This was made possible first because a large training dataset became available from IS-Dom, and second because we selected a small number of optimal features from a huge number of potential ones. The training helical linker dataset, which included 261 helical linkers, was constructed by detecting helical residues at the boundary regions of two independent structural domains listed in our previously reported IS-Dom dataset. 45 optimal feature candidates were selected from 3,000 features by random forest, which were further reduced to 26 optimal features by stepwise selection. The prediction sensitivity and precision of H-DROP were 35.2 and 38.8%, respectively. These values were over 10.7% higher than those of control methods including our previously developed DROP, which is a coil linker predictor, and PPRODO, which is trained with un-differentiated domain boundary sequences. Overall, these results indicated that helical linkers can be predicted from sequence information alone by using a strictly curated training data set for helical linkers and carefully selected set of optimal features.

24372041,miRror2.0: a platform for assessing the joint action of microRNAs in cell regulation.,"microRNAs (miRNAs) are short, noncoding RNAs that negatively regulate the levels of mRNA post-transcriptionally.

These results raised the notion of miRNAs teamwork for a wide range of cellular context. miRror2.0 utilizes the miRNA-target predictions from over a dozen programs and resources and unifies them under a common statistical basis. The platform, called miRror2.0, considers the combinatorial regulation by miRNAs in different tissues, cell lines and under a broad range of conditions. A flexible setting permits the selection of the preferred combination of miRNA-target prediction resources as well as the statistical parameters for the analysis. miRror2.0 covers six major model organisms including human and mouse. Importantly, the system is capable of analyzing hundreds of genes that were subjected to miRNAs' regulation. Activating miRror2.0 by introducing thousands of genes from miRNA overexpression experiments successfully identified the objective miRNAs. The output from miRror2.0 is a list of genes that is optimally regulated by a defined set of miRNAs. A symmetric application of miRror2.0 starts with a set of miRNAs, and the system then seeks the preferred set of genes that are regulated by that miRNA composition. The results from miRror2.0 are empowered by an iterative procedure called PSI-miRror. PSI-miRror tests the robustness of miRror2.0 prediction. It allows a refinement of the initial list of genes in view of the miRNAs that optimally regulate this list.

Behaviours including cigarette smoking, physical inactivity and alcohol misuse, as well as certain dietary behaviours, contribute to deaths and disability by increasing the risk of cancers, cardiovascular diseases and diabetes. Interventions have been designed to change these health behaviours with a view to reducing these health risks. However, the effectiveness of these interventions has been quite variable and further information is needed to enhance their success. More information is needed about the specific processes that underlie the effectiveness of intervention strategies.<h4>Aim</h4>Researchers have developed a taxonomy of 93 behaviour change techniques (i.e. the active components of an intervention that bring about behavioural change), but little is known regarding their potential mechanisms of action (i.e. the processes through which a behaviour change technique affects behaviour). We therefore aimed to examine links between behaviour change techniques and mechanisms of action.<h4>Method</h4>First, we conducted a literature synthesis study of 277 behaviour change intervention studies, from which we extracted information on links, described by authors, between behaviour change techniques and mechanisms of action, and identified an average of 10 links per intervention report. Second, behaviour change experts (n = 105) were engaged in a three-round consensus study in which they discussed and rated their confidence in the presence/absence of ëlinksí and ënon-linksí between commonly used behaviour change techniques (n = 61) and a set of mechanisms of action (n = 26). Ninety links and 460 ënon-linksí reached the pre-set threshold of 80% agreement. To enhance the validity of these results, a third study was conducted that triangulated the findings of the first two studies. Discrepancies and uncertainties between the studies were included in a reconciliation consensus study with a new group of experts (n = 25). The final results identified 92 definite behaviour change techniqueñmechanism of action links and 465 definite non-links. In a fourth study, we examined whether or not groups of behaviour change techniques used together frequently across interventions revealed shared theoretical underpinnings. We found that experts agreed on the underlying theory for three groups of behaviour change techniques.<h4>Results</h4>Our results are potentially useful to policy-makers and practitioners in selecting behaviour change techniques to include in behaviour change interventions. However, our data do not demonstrate that the behaviour change techniques are effective in targeting the mechanism of action; rather, the links identified may be the ëbest betsí for interventions that are effective in changing mechanisms of action, and the non-links are unlikely to be effective. Researchers examining effectiveness of interventions in either primary studies or evidence syntheses may consider these links for further investigation.<h4>Conclusion</h4>To make our results usable by researchers, practitioners and policy-makers, they are available in an online interactive tool, which enables discussion and collaboration (https://theoryandtechniquetool.humanbehaviourchange.org/); accessed 1 March 2020. This work, building on previous work to develop the behaviour change technique taxonomy, is part of an ongoing programme of work: the Human Behaviour Change Project (www.humanbehaviourchange.org/; accessed 1 March 2020).<h4>Funding</h4>This project was funded by the Medical Research Council via its Methodology Panel: ëDeveloping methodology for designing and evaluating theory-based complex interventions: an ontology for linking behaviour change techniques to theoryí (reference MR/L011115/1).",0,iffy 
29155427,PDB-wide identification of biological assemblies from conserved quaternary structure geometry.,"Protein structures are key to understanding biomolecular mechanisms and diseases, yet their interpretation is hampered by limited knowledge of their biologically relevant quaternary structure (QS). A critical challenge in inferring QS information from crystallographic data is distinguishing biological interfaces from fortuitous crystal-packing contacts. Here, we tackled this problem by developing strategies for aligning and comparing QS states across both homologs and data repositories. QS conservation across homologs proved remarkably strong at predicting biological relevance and is implemented in two methods, QSalign and anti-QSalign, for annotating homo-oligomers and monomers, respectively. QS conservation across repositories is implemented in QSbio (http://www.QSbio.org), which approaches the accuracy of manual curation and allowed us to predict >100,000 QS states across the Protein Data Bank. Based on this high-quality data set, we analyzed pairs of structurally conserved interfaces, and this analysis revealed a striking plasticity whereby evolutionary distant interfaces maintain similar interaction geometries through widely divergent chemical properties.",1,iffy   
34135895,Transcriptomic Signature Differences Between¬†SARS-CoV-2 and Influenza Virus Infected Patients.,"The reason why most individuals with COVID-19 have relatively limited symptoms while other develop respiratory distress with life-threatening complications remains unknown. Increasing evidence suggests that COVID-19 associated adverse outcomes mainly rely on dysregulated immunity.†Here, we compared transcriptomic profiles of blood cells from 103 patients with different severity levels of COVID-19 with that of 27 healthy and 22 influenza-infected individuals. Data provided a complete overview of SARS-CoV-2-induced immune signature, including a dramatic defect in IFN responses, a reduction of toxicity-related molecules in NK cells, an increased degranulation of neutrophils, a dysregulation of T cells, a dramatic increase in B cell function and immunoglobulin production, as well as an important over-expression of genes involved in metabolism and cell cycle in patients infected with SARS-CoV-2 compared to those infected with influenza viruses. These features also differed according to COVID-19 severity. Overall and specific gene expression patterns across groups can be visualized on an interactive website (https://bix.unil.ch/covid/).

To provide a framework for this assembly, it would be a great advantage to have a dense map of the tammar wallaby genome. However, only limited mapping data are available for this non-model species, comprising a physical map and a linkage map.<h4>Results</h4>We combined all available tammar wallaby mapping data to create a tammar wallaby integrated map, using the Location DataBase (LDB) strategy. This first-generation integrated map combines all available information from the second-generation tammar wallaby linkage map with 148 loci, and extensive FISH mapping data for 492 loci, especially for genes likely to be located at the ends of wallaby chromosomes or at evolutionary breakpoints inferred from comparative information. For loci whose positions are only approximately known, their location in the integrated map was refined on the basis of comparative information from opossum (Monodelphis domestica) and human. Interpolation of segments from the opossum and human assemblies into the integrated map enabled the subsequent construction of a tammar wallaby first-generation virtual genome map, which comprises 14336 markers, including 13783 genes recruited from opossum and human assemblies. Both maps are freely available at http://compldb.angis.org.au.<h4>Conclusions</h4>The first-generation integrated map and the first-generation virtual genome map provide a backbone for the chromosome assembly of the tammar wallaby genome sequence. For example, 78% of the 10257 gene-scaffolds in the Ensembl annotation of the tammar wallaby genome sequence (including 10522 protein-coding genes) can now be given a chromosome location in the tammar wallaby virtual genome map.",1,"iffy - data from elsewhere, but integrated, may count then… not available so will fall out later"

22479706,Network-based functional enrichment.,"<h4>Background</h4>Many methods have been developed to infer and reason about molecular interaction networks. These approaches often yield networks with hundreds or thousands of nodes and up to an order of magnitude more edges. It is often desirable to summarize the biological information in such networks. A very common approach is to use gene function enrichment analysis for this task. A major drawback of this method is that it ignores information about the edges in the network being analyzed, i.e., it treats the network simply as a set of genes. In this paper, we introduce a novel method for functional enrichment that explicitly takes network interactions into account.<h4>Results</h4>Our approach naturally generalizes Fisher's exact test, a gene set-based technique. Given a function of interest, we compute the subgraph of the network induced by genes annotated to this function. We use the sequence of sizes of the connected components of this sub-network to estimate its connectivity. We estimate the statistical significance of the connectivity empirically by a permutation test. We present three applications of our method: i) determine which functions are enriched in a given network, ii) given a network and an interesting subnetwork of genes within that network, determine which functions are enriched in the sub-network, and iii) given two networks, determine the functions for which the connectivity improves when we merge the second network into the first. Through these applications, we show that our approach is a natural alternative to network clustering algorithms.<h4>Conclusions</h4>We presented a novel approach to functional enrichment that takes into account the pairwise relationships among genes annotated by a particular function. Each of the three applications discovers highly relevant functions. We used our methods to study biological data from three different organisms. Our results demonstrate the wide applicability of our methods. Our algorithms are implemented in C++ and are freely available under the GNU General Public License at our supplementary website.

21303543,An EST-based analysis identifies new genes and reveals distinctive gene expression features of Coffea arabica and Coffea canephora.,"<h4>Background</h4>Coffee is one of the world's most important crops; it is consumed worldwide and plays a significant role in the economy of producing countries. Coffea arabica and C. canephora are responsible for 70 and 30% of commercial production, respectively. C. arabica is an allotetraploid from a recent hybridization of the diploid species, C. canephora and C. eugenioides. C. arabica has lower genetic diversity and results in a higher quality beverage than C. canephora. Research initiatives have been launched to produce genomic and transcriptomic data about Coffea spp. as a strategy to improve breeding efficiency.<h4>Results</h4>Assembling the expressed sequence tags (ESTs) of C. arabica and C. canephora produced by the Brazilian Coffee Genome Project and the NestlÈ-Cornell Consortium revealed 32,007 clusters of C. arabica and 16,665 clusters of C. canephora. We detected different GC3 profiles between these species that are related to their genome structure and mating system. BLAST analysis revealed similarities between coffee and grape (Vitis vinifera) genes. Using KA/KS analysis, we identified coffee genes under purifying and positive selection. Protein domain and gene ontology analyses suggested differences between Coffea spp. data, mainly in relation to complex sugar synthases and nucleotide binding proteins. OrthoMCL was used to identify specific and prevalent coffee protein families when compared to five other plant species. Among the interesting families annotated are new cystatins, glycine-rich proteins and RALF-like peptides. Hierarchical clustering was used to independently group C. arabica and C. canephora expression clusters according to expression data extracted from EST libraries, resulting in the identification of differentially expressed genes. Based on these results, we emphasize gene annotation and discuss plant defenses, abiotic stress and cup quality-related functional categories.<h4>Conclusion</h4>We present the first comprehensive genome-wide transcript profile study of C. arabica and C. canephora, which can be freely assessed by the scientific community at http://www.lge.ibi.unicamp.br/coffea. Our data reveal the presence of species-specific/prevalent genes in coffee that may help to explain particular characteristics of these two crops. The identification of differentially expressed transcripts offers a starting point for the correlation between gene expression profiles and Coffea spp. developmental traits, providing valuable insights for coffee breeding and biotechnology, especially concerning sugar metabolism and stress tolerance.",1,iffy - project website but aggregated and value add… looks like it'd be in risk if the data aren't elsewhere
31886876,Prognostic model for multiple myeloma progression integrating gene expression and clinical features.,"BACKGROUND:Multiple myeloma (MM) is a hematological cancer caused by abnormal accumulation of monoclonal plasma cells in bone marrow. With the increase in treatment options, risk-adapted therapy is becoming more and more important. Survival analysis is commonly applied to study progression or other events of interest and stratify the risk of patients. RESULTS:In this study, we present the current state-of-the-art model for MM prognosis and the molecular biomarker set for stratification: the winning algorithm in the 2017 Multiple Myeloma DREAM Challenge, Sub-Challenge 3. Specifically, we built a non-parametric complete hazard ranking model to map the right-censored data into a linear space, where commonplace machine learning techniques, such as Gaussian process regression and random forests, can play their roles. Our model integrated both the gene expression profile and clinical features to predict the progression of MM. Compared with conventional models, such as Cox model and random survival forests, our model achieved higher accuracy in 3 within-cohort predictions. In addition, it showed robust predictive power in cross-cohort validations. Key molecular signatures related to MM progression were identified from our model, which may function as the core determinants of MM progression and provide important guidance for future research and clinical practice. Functional enrichment analysis and mammalian gene-gene interaction network revealed crucial biological processes and pathways involved in MM progression. The model is dockerized and publicly available at https://www.synapse.org/#!Synapse:syn11459638. Both data and reproducible code are included in the docker.

We recognize ten species previously attributed to a single Neotropical species, Cales noacki Howard, which in the strict sense is a species broadly disseminated to control woolly whitefly. A neotype is designated for C. noacki, and it is redescribed based on specimens molecularly determined to be conspecific with the neotype. Newly described species include: C. bicolor Mottern, n.sp., C. breviclava Mottern, n.sp., C. brevisensillum Mottern n.sp., C. curvigladius Mottern, n.sp., C. longiseta Mottern, n.sp., C. multisensillum Mottern n.sp., C. noyesi Mottern, n.sp., C. parvigladius Mottern, n.sp. and C. rosei Mottern, n.sp. Species are delimited based on a combination of morphological and molecular data (28S-D2 rDNA and COI). Additional specimens are included in the phylogenetic analyses and although these likely represent several new species, we lack sufficient specimen sampling to describe them at this time. Cales are highly morphologically conserved and character-poor, resulting in several cryptic species.

This view is not easily obtained: it requires the integration of context-specific protein list or expression data with up-to-date data of protein interactions that are typically spread across multiple databases. The MyProteinNet web server allows users to easily create such context-sensitive protein interaction networks. Users can automatically gather and consolidate data from up to 11 different databases to create a generic protein interaction network (interactome). They can score the interactions based on reliability and filter them by user-defined contexts including molecular expression and protein annotation. The output of MyProteinNet includes the generic and filtered interactome files, together with a summary of their network attributes. MyProteinNet is particularly geared toward building human tissue interactomes, by maintaining tissue expression profiles from multiple resources. The ability of MyProteinNet to facilitate the construction of up-to-date, context-specific interactomes and its applicability to 11 different organisms and to tens of human tissues, make it a powerful tool in meaningful analysis of protein networks.

23771137,Secondary structure and domain architecture of the 23S and 5S rRNAs.,"We present a de novo re-determination of the secondary (2∞) structure and domain architecture of the 23S and 5S rRNAs, using 3D structures, determined by X-ray diffraction, as input. In the traditional 2∞ structure, the center of the 23S rRNA is an extended single strand, which in 3D is seen to be compact and double helical. Accurately assigning nucleotides to helices compels a revision of the 23S rRNA 2∞ structure. Unlike the traditional 2∞ structure, the revised 2∞ structure of the 23S rRNA shows architectural similarity with the 16S rRNA. The revised 2∞ structure also reveals a clear relationship with the 3D structure and is generalizable to rRNAs of other species from all three domains of life. The 2∞ structure revision required us to reconsider the domain architecture. We partitioned the 23S rRNA into domains through analysis of molecular interactions, calculations of 2D folding propensities and compactness. The best domain model for the 23S rRNA contains seven domains, not six as previously ascribed. Domain 0 forms the core of the 23S rRNA, to which the other six domains are rooted.

29743053,PDXliver: a database of liver cancer patient derived xenograft mouse models.,"<h4>Background</h4>Liver cancer is the second leading cause of cancer-related deaths and characterized by heterogeneity and drug resistance. Patient-derived xenograft (PDX) models have been widely used in cancer research because they reproduce the characteristics of original tumors. However, the current studies of liver cancer PDX mice are scattered and the number of available PDX models are too small to represent the heterogeneity of liver cancer patients. To improve this situation and to complement available PDX models related resources, here we constructed a comprehensive database, PDXliver, to integrate and analyze liver cancer PDX models.<h4>Description</h4>Currently, PDXliver contains 116 PDX models from Chinese liver cancer patients, 51 of them were established by the in-house PDX platform and others were curated from the public literatures. These models are annotated with complete information, including clinical characteristics of patients, genome-wide expression profiles, germline variations, somatic mutations and copy number alterations. Analysis of expression subtypes and mutated genes show that PDXliver represents the diversity of human patients. Another feature of PDXliver is storing drug response data of PDX mice, which makes it possible to explore the association between molecular profiles and drug sensitivity. All data can be accessed via the Browse and Search pages. Additionally, two tools are provided to interactively visualize the omics data of selected PDXs or to compare two groups†of PDXs.<h4>Conclusion</h4>As far as we known, PDXliver is the first public database of liver cancer PDX models.

However, ongoing debates exist regarding their relationship with hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) whose incidence is widely debated among investigators. This study was conducted to identify host pharmacogenetic factors that may influence HCC incidence upon using HCV DAAs.<h4>Materials and methods</h4>Details regarding 16 HCV DAAs were collected from literature and DrugBank database. Digital structures of these drugs were fed into the pharmacogenomics/pharmacovigilance <i>in</i> <i>-</i> <i>silico</i> pipeline (PHARMIP) to predict the genetic factors that may underpin HCC development.<h4>Results</h4>We identified 184 unique genes and 40 unique variants that may have key answers for the DAA/HCC paradox. These findings could be used in different methods to aid in the precise application of HCV DAAs and minimize the proposed risk for HCC. All results could be accessed at: https://doi.org/10.17632/8ws8258hn3.2.<h4>Discussion</h4>All the identified factors are evidence related to HCC and significantly predicted by PHARMIP as DAA targets. We discuss some examples of the methods of using these results to address the DAA/HCC controversy based on the following three primary levels: 1 - individual DAA drug, 2 - DAA subclass, and 3 - the entire DAA class.

IND606755271,Visual features based automated identification of fish species using deep convolutional neural networks,"Morphological based fish species identification is an erroneous and time-consuming process. There are numerous fish species and due to their close resemblance with each other, it is difficult to classify them by external characters. Recently, computer vision and deep learning-based identification of different animal species is being widely used by the researchers. Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) is one of the most analytically powerful tools in deep learning architecture for the image classification based on visual features. This work aims to propose a deep learning framework based on the CNN method for fish species identification. The proposed CNN architecture contains 32 deep layers that are considerably deep to derive valuable and discriminating features from the image. The deep supervision is inflicted on the VGGNet architecture to increase the classification performance by instantly adding four convolutional layers to the training of each level in the network. To test the performance of proposed 32-Layer CNN architecture, we developed a dataset termed as Fish-Pak and is publicly available at Mendeley data (Fish-Pak: https://doi.org/10.17632/n3ydw29sbz.3#folder-6b024354-bae3-460a-a758-352685ba0e38).

The 3D structures of complex proteins are reliable source of domain-domain interaction (DDI) but the number of proven structures is very limited. Several resources for the computationally predicted DDI have been generated but they are scattered in various places and their prediction show erratic performances. A well-organized PPI and DDI analysis system integrating these data with fair scoring system is necessary.<h4>Method</h4>We integrated three structure-based DDI datasets and twenty computationally predicted DDI datasets and constructed an interaction analysis system, named IDDI, which enables to browse protein and domain interactions with their relationships. To integrate heterogeneous DDI information, a novel scoring scheme is introduced to determine the reliability of DDI by considering the prediction scores of each DDI and the confidence levels of each prediction method in the datasets, and independencies between predicted datasets. In addition, we connected this DDI information to the comprehensive PPI information and developed a unified interface for the interaction analysis exploring interaction networks at both protein and domain level.<h4>Result</h4>IDDI provides 204,705 DDIs among total 7,351 Pfam domains in the current version. The result presents that total number of DDIs is increased eight times more than that of previous studies. Due to the increment of data, 50.4% of PPIs could be correlated with DDIs which is more than twice of previous resources. Newly designed scoring scheme outperformed the previous system in its accuracy too. User interface of IDDI system provides interactive investigation of proteins and domains in interactions with interconnected way.

23703214,PiDNA: Predicting protein-DNA interactions with structural models.,"Predicting binding sites of a transcription factor in the genome is an important, but challenging, issue in studying gene regulation. In the past decade, a large number of protein-DNA co-crystallized structures available in the Protein Data Bank have facilitated the understanding of interacting mechanisms between transcription factors and their binding sites. Recent studies have shown that both physics-based and knowledge-based potential functions can be applied to protein-DNA complex structures to deliver position weight matrices (PWMs) that are consistent with the experimental data. To further use the available structural models, the proposed Web server, PiDNA, aims at first constructing reliable PWMs by applying an atomic-level knowledge-based scoring function on numerous in silico mutated complex structures, and then using the PWM constructed by the structure models with small energy changes to predict the interaction between proteins and DNA sequences. With PiDNA, the users can easily predict the relative preference of all the DNA sequences with limited mutations from the native sequence co-crystallized in the model in a single run. More predictions on sequences with unlimited mutations can be realized by additional requests or file uploading. Three types of information can be downloaded after prediction: (i) the ranked list of mutated sequences, (ii) the PWM constructed by the favourable mutated structures, and (iii) any mutated protein-DNA complex structure models specified by the user. This study first shows that the constructed PWMs are similar to the annotated PWMs collected from databases or literature. Second, the prediction accuracy of PiDNA in detecting relatively high-specificity sites is evaluated by comparing the ranked lists against in vitro experiments from protein-binding microarrays. Finally, PiDNA is shown to be able to select the experimentally validated binding sites from 10,000 random sites with high accuracy. With PiDNA, the users can design biological experiments based on the predicted sequence specificity and/or request mutated structure models for further protein design. As well, it is expected that PiDNA can be incorporated with chromatin immunoprecipitation data to refine large-scale inference of in vivo protein-DNA interactions.

The tool is available from http://bionetworkbench.sourceforge.net/ Background The emergence of high-throughput technologies has allowed many biological investigators to collect a great deal of information about the behavior of genes and gene products over time or during a particular disease state. Gene and protein networks offer a powerful approach for integration of the disparate yet complimentary types of data that result from such high-throughput analyses.

21988420,"Pain, analgesia and genetics.","<h4>Objectives</h4>In the clinical setting, there is marked intersubject variability in the intensity of pain reported by patients with apparently similar pain states, as well as widely differing analgesic dosing requirements between individuals to produce satisfactory pain relief with tolerable side-effects. Genetic and environmental factors as well as their interaction are implicated, and these are discussed in this review.<h4>Key findings</h4>Pioneering work undertaken in mice more than a decade ago, showed a strong genetic contribution to levels of nociception/hypersensitivity as well as levels of antinociception produced by commonly available analgesic agents. To date more than 300 candidate 'pain' genes have been identified as potentially contributing to heritable differences in pain sensitivity and analgesic responsiveness in animals and humans, with this information available in a publicly accessible database http://www.jbldesign.com/jmogil/enter.html. Since then, many genetic association studies have been conducted in humans to investigate the possibility that single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in an individual gene may explain drug inefficacy or excessive toxicity experienced by a small subset of the whole population who have the rare allele for a particular SNP.<h4>Summary</h4>Despite the fact that SNPs in more than 20 genes that affect pain sensitivity or contribute to interindividual variability in responses to analgesic medications have been identified in the human genome, much of the data is conflicting. Apart from deficiencies in the design and conduct of human genetic association studies, recent research from other fields has implicated epigenetic mechanisms that facilitate dynamic gene-environment communication, as a possible explanation.",0,not about the resource

IMPLEMENTATION OF METHYLATION PROFILING FOR CNS TUMOR DIAGNOSIS IN THE PRINCESS M√ÅXIMA CENTER FOR PEDIATRIC ONCOLOGY, THE NETHERLANDS","Abstract <h4>BACKGROUND</h4> Since the fall of 2016, in the Netherlands diagnosis and treatment of children with CNS tumors is increasingly concentrated in the Princess M·xima Center (PMC), i.e. the newly established, national center for pediatric oncology. Because of its potential as a support tool for CNS tumor diagnosis, Infinium MethylationEPIC BeadChip analysis was readily implemented and ëroutinelyí performed on pediatric CNS tumor samples in the PMC. AIM: To identify the challenges and opportunities of methylation profiling as a support tool for the diagnosis of pediatric CNS tumors. PATIENTS AND <h4>METHODS</h4> We have now analyzed >150 pediatric (formalin-fixed/paraffin-embedded) CNS tumor samples using methylation profiling and matched the profiles with the ëHeidelberg databaseí (https://www.molecularneuropathology.org/mnp). <h4>RESULTS</h4> In > 90% of analyzed cases, the suggested methylation class corresponded very well with the pathological (histological +/- molecular) diagnosis. In some other cases, the suggested methylation class was not very helpful because the reliability score of the test was (too) low, or because the suggested class not adequately reflected the actual presence of a tumor (e.g. ëreactive/inflammatory changesí) or was not (yet) as precise as desired (e.g. ëdiffuse glioma/glioblastoma, IDH-wildtype, midline type (but not H3-mutant)í). However, in many other cases the tool was very helpful for reaching a more precise diagnosis (esp. so for medulloblastomas, ependymomas) or directed towards the right diagnosis. <h4>CONCLUSIONS</h4> Methylation profiling is a very powerful tool to confirm, fine-tune and/or direct pediatric CNS tumor diagnostics.

28817627,Analysing researchers' outreach efforts and the association with publication metrics: A case study of Kudos.,"With the growth of scholarly collaboration networks and social communication platforms, members of the scholarly community are experimenting with their approach to disseminating research outputs, in an effort to increase their audience and outreach. However, from a researcher's point of view, it is difficult to determine whether efforts to make work more visible are worthwhile (in terms of the association with publication metrics) and within that, difficult to assess which platform or network is most effective for sharing work and connecting to a wider audience. We undertook a case study of Kudos (https://www.growkudos.com), a web-based service that claims to help researchers increase the outreach of their publications, to examine the most effective tools for sharing publications online, and to investigate which actions are associated with improved metrics. We extracted a dataset from Kudos of 830,565 unique publications claimed by authors, for which 20,775 had actions taken to explain or share via Kudos, and for 4,867 of these full text download data from publishers was available. Findings show that researchers are most likely to share their work on Facebook, but links shared on Twitter are more likely to be clicked on. A Mann-Whitney U test revealed that a treatment group (publications having actions in Kudos) had a significantly higher median average of 149 full text downloads (23.1% more) per publication as compared to a control group (having no actions in Kudos) with a median average of 121 full text downloads per publication. These findings suggest that performing actions on publications, such as sharing, explaining, or enriching, could help to increase the number of full text downloads of a publication.",0,not about the resource
24799331,Allergen cross-reactivity in allergic rhinitis and oral-allergy syndrome: a bioinformatic protein sequence analysis.,"<h4>Background</h4>Clinical allergy cross-reactivity that is seen with related inhalant allergens or between unrelated inhalant allergens and foods in oral allergy syndrome (OAS) remains poorly understood. The goal of this study is to determine whether clinical cross-reactivity can be identified from primary protein sequences in allergy epitopes and food proteins.<h4>Methods</h4>High-throughput analysis was performed by assembling all known allergy epitopes within the Immune Epitope Database (IEDB; http://www.iedb.org) for 5 common species from 5 inhalant allergen subclasses and comparing their protein sequences to each other, as well as to sequences of intact proteins from known cross-reactive foods in the European Molecular Biology Laboratory-European Bioinformatics Institute (EMBL-EBI) protein database (http://www.uniprot.org) that have been implicated in OAS. Computational methods were employed to allow for exact matching, gaps, and similar amino acids using multiple algorithms. A phylogenetic tree was created to determine evolutionary relationships between cross-reactive epitopes in OAS.<h4>Results</h4>Twenty-three common inhalant allergens had 4429 unique epitopes; the 19 foods implicated in OAS had 9497 protein sequences. The Basic Local Alignment Search Tool (BLAST) algorithm identified interclass and intraclass sequence similarities for the 5 inhalant allergy classes with high similarity for mites, grasses, and trees. Analysis of OAS proteins identified 104 matches to inhalant allergy epitopes that are known to cross-react. The phylogenetic tree displayed relationships that mostly followed organism phylogeny.<h4>Conclusion</h4>Use of primary protein sequences was successful in explaining clinical allergy cross-reactivity. Clinical correlation is needed for use of these epitopes as diagnostic or therapeutic entities for patients with cross-reactive allergic disease.",0,not about the resource

However, there is still no consensus for the use of biomarkers in clinical acute spinal cord injury (SCI). The aims of this review are (1) to evaluate the current status of neurochemical biomarkers and (2) to discuss their potential acute diagnostic role in SCI by reviewing the literature.<h4>Methods</h4>PubMed (http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed) was searched up to 2012 to identify publications concerning diagnostic biomarkers in SCI. To support more knowledge, we also checked secondary references in the primarily retrieved literature.<h4>Results</h4>Neurofilaments, cleaved-Tau, microtubule-associated protein 2, myelin basic protein, neuron-specific enolase, S100ﬂ, and glial fibrillary acidic protein were identified as structural protein biomarkers in SCI by this review process. We could not find reports relating ubiquitin C-terminal hydrolase-L1 and a-II spectrin breakdown products, which are widely researched in other central nervous system injuries. Therefore, we present our preliminary data relating to these two biomarkers. Some of biomarkers showed promising results for SCI diagnosis and outcome prediction; however, there were unresolved issues relating to accuracy and their accessibility.<h4>Conclusion</h4>Currently, there still are not many reports focused on diagnostic biomarkers in SCI. This fact warranted the need for greater efforts to innovate sensitive and reliable biomarkers for SCI.",0,not about the resource

22859915,Assessing drug target association using semantic linked data.,"The rapidly increasing amount of public data in chemistry and biology provides new opportunities for large-scale data mining for drug discovery. Systematic integration of these heterogeneous sets and provision of algorithms to data mine the integrated sets would permit investigation of complex mechanisms of action of drugs. In this work we integrated and annotated data from public datasets relating to drugs, chemical compounds, protein targets, diseases, side effects and pathways, building a semantic linked network consisting of over 290,000 nodes and 720,000 edges. We developed a statistical model to assess the association of drug target pairs based on their relation with other linked objects. Validation experiments demonstrate the model can correctly identify known direct drug target pairs with high precision. Indirect drug target pairs (for example drugs which change gene expression level) are also identified but not as strongly as direct pairs. We further calculated the association scores for 157 drugs from 10 disease areas against 1683 human targets, and measured their similarity using a [Formula: see text] score matrix. The similarity network indicates that drugs from the same disease area tend to cluster together in ways that are not captured by structural similarity, with several potential new drug pairings being identified.

24564522,Incorporating substrate sequence motifs and spatial amino acid composition to identify kinase-specific phosphorylation sites on protein three-dimensional structures.,"<h4>Background</h4>Protein phosphorylation catalyzed by kinases plays crucial regulatory roles in cellular processes. Given the high-throughput mass spectrometry-based experiments, the desire to annotate the catalytic kinases for in vivo phosphorylation sites has motivated. Thus, a variety of computational methods have been developed for performing a large-scale prediction of kinase-specific phosphorylation sites. However, most of the proposed methods solely rely on the local amino acid sequences surrounding the phosphorylation sites. An increasing number of three-dimensional structures make it possible to physically investigate the structural environment of phosphorylation sites.<h4>Results</h4>In this work, all of the experimental phosphorylation sites are mapped to the protein entries of Protein Data Bank by sequence identity. It resulted in a total of 4508 phosphorylation sites containing the protein three-dimensional (3D) structures. To identify phosphorylation sites on protein 3D structures, this work incorporates support vector machines (SVMs) with the information of linear motifs and spatial amino acid composition, which is determined for each kinase group by calculating the relative frequencies of 20 amino acid types within a specific radial distance from central phosphorylated amino acid residue. After the cross-validation evaluation, most of the kinase-specific models trained with the consideration of structural information outperform the models considering only the sequence information. Furthermore, the independent testing set which is not included in training set has demonstrated that the proposed method could provide a comparable performance to other popular tools.<h4>Conclusion</h4>The proposed method is shown to be capable of predicting kinase-specific phosphorylation sites on 3D structures and has been implemented as a web server which is freely accessible at http://csb.cse.yzu.edu.tw/PhosK3D/. Due to the difficulty of identifying the kinase-specific phosphorylation sites with similar sequenced motifs, this work also integrates the 3D structural information to improve the cross classifying specificity.",0,not found

Using the method, continuous real-value prediction as well as two-state and three-state discrete predictions can be obtained. The method utilizes the z-score value of the distance measure in the feature vector space to estimate the relative contribution among the k-nearest neighbors for prediction of the discrete and continuous solvent accessibility. The Solvent accessibility database is constructed from 5717 proteins extracted from PISCES culling server with the cutoff of 25% sequence identities. Using optimal parameters, the prediction accuracies (for discrete predictions) of 78.38% (two-state prediction with the threshold of 25%), 65.1% (three-state prediction with the thresholds of 9 and 36%), and the Pearson correlation coefficient (between the predicted and true RSA's for continuous prediction) of 0.676 are achieved An independent benchmark test was performed with the CASP8 targets where we find that the proposed method outperforms existing methods. The prediction accuracies are 80.89% (for two state prediction with the threshold of 25%), 67.58% (three-state prediction), and the Pearson correlation coefficient of 0.727 (for continuous prediction) with mean absolute error of 0.148.

As data collection is increasingly streamlined and ubiquitous, data exploration, discovery and analytics get considerably harder. Exploratory querying of heterogeneous and multi-source information is both difficult and necessary to advance our knowledge about the world around us.<h4>Research design</h4>We developed a mechanism to integrate dispersed multi-source data and service the mashed information via human and machine interfaces in a secure, scalable manner. This process facilitates the exploration of subtle associations between variables, population strata, or clusters of data elements, which may be opaque to standard independent inspection of the individual sources. This a new platform includes a device agnostic tool (Dashboard webapp, http://socr.umich.edu/HTML5/Dashboard/) for graphical querying, navigating and exploring the multivariate associations in complex heterogeneous datasets.<h4>Results</h4>The paper illustrates this core functionality and serviceoriented infrastructure using healthcare data (e.g., US data from the 2010 Census, Demographic and Economic surveys, Bureau of Labor Statistics, and Center for Medicare Services) as well as Parkinson's Disease neuroimaging data. Both the back-end data archive and the front-end dashboard interfaces are continuously expanded to include additional data elements and new ways to customize the human and machine interactions.<h4>Conclusions</h4>A client-side data import utility allows for easy and intuitive integration of user-supplied datasets.

24655548,Analysis of growth factor signaling in genetically diverse breast cancer lines.,"<h4>Background</h4>Soluble growth factors present in the microenvironment play a major role in tumor development, invasion, metastasis, and responsiveness to targeted therapies. While the biochemistry of growth factor-dependent signal transduction has been studied extensively in individual cell types, relatively little systematic data are available across genetically diverse cell lines.<h4>Results</h4>We describe a quantitative and comparative dataset focused on immediate-early signaling that regulates the AKT (AKT1/2/3) and ERK (MAPK1/3) pathways in a canonical panel of well-characterized breast cancer lines. We also provide interactive web-based tools to facilitate follow-on analysis of the data. Our findings show that breast cancers are diverse with respect to ligand sensitivity and signaling biochemistry. Surprisingly, triple negative breast cancers (TNBCs; which express low levels of ErbB2, progesterone and estrogen receptors) are the most broadly responsive to growth factors and HER2amp cancers (which overexpress ErbB2) the least. The ratio of ERK to AKT activation varies with ligand and subtype, with a systematic bias in favor of ERK in hormone receptor positive (HR+) cells. The factors that correlate with growth factor responsiveness depend on whether fold-change or absolute activity is considered the key biological variable, and they differ between ERK and AKT pathways.<h4>Conclusions</h4>Responses to growth factors are highly diverse across breast cancer cell lines, even within the same subtype. A simple four-part heuristic suggests that diversity arises from variation in receptor abundance, an ERK/AKT bias that depends on ligand identity, a set of factors common to all receptors that varies in abundance or activity with cell line, and an ""indirect negative regulation"" by ErbB2. This analysis sets the stage for the development of a mechanistic and predictive model of growth factor signaling in diverse cancer lines.

32078592,"Characteristics and Health Status of Informal Unpaid Caregivers - 44 States, District of Columbia, and Puerto Rico, 2015-2017.","In 2015, an estimated 17.7 million U.S. persons were informal caregivers who provided substantial services through in-home, unpaid assistance to their family members and friends (1). Caregiving can have many benefits, such as enhancing the bond between caregiver and recipient, but it can also place an emotional and physical strain on caregivers, leading to higher rates of depression, lower quality of life, and poorer overall health (2). As the U.S. population continues to age (3), the need for informal caregivers will likely increase. However, little nationally representative information on prevalence of caregivers is available. This study examined demographic characteristics and health status of informal caregivers from 44 states,* the District of Columbia (DC), and Puerto Rico, based on data from the Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System (BRFSS) collected during 2015-2017. Overall, approximately one in five adults reported that they had provided care to a family member or friend in the preceding 30 days. Fifty-eight percent of caregivers were women, and a majority were non-Hispanic white, with at least some college education, and married or living with a partner. Across all states, 19.2% of caregivers reported being in fair or poor health, although significant state-to-state variation occurred. Caregivers provide important support to family members, friends, and the health care system and might compromise their own health to provide this support (1,2). Better understanding of caregivers and the challenges they face could inform implementation of improvements in support systems that could enhance not only the health of the caregiver, but that of the care recipient as well. For example, additional data regarding demographics at the state level might aid in more effective planning and support of caregivers with evidence-based programs and assistance (https://www.cdc.gov/aging/publications/features/caring-for-yourself.html).",0,public health
21624162,Developing a kidney and urinary pathway knowledge base.,"<h4>Background</h4>Chronic renal disease is a global health problem. The identification of suitable biomarkers could facilitate early detection and diagnosis and allow better understanding of the underlying pathology. One of the challenges in meeting this goal is the necessary integration of experimental results from multiple biological levels for further analysis by data mining. Data integration in the life science is still a struggle, and many groups are looking to the benefits promised by the Semantic Web for data integration.<h4>Results</h4>We present a Semantic Web approach to developing a knowledge base that integrates data from high-throughput experiments on kidney and urine. A specialised KUP ontology is used to tie the various layers together, whilst background knowledge from external databases is incorporated by conversion into RDF. Using SPARQL as a query mechanism, we are able to query for proteins expressed in urine and place these back into the context of genes expressed in regions of the kidney.<h4>Conclusions</h4>The KUPKB gives KUP biologists the means to ask queries across many resources in order to aggregate knowledge that is necessary for answering biological questions. The Semantic Web technologies we use, together with the background knowledge from the domain's ontologies, allows both rapid conversion and integration of this knowledge base. The KUPKB is still relatively small, but questions remain about scalability, maintenance and availability of the knowledge itself.<h4>Availability</h4>The KUPKB may be accessed via http://www.e-lico.eu/kupkb.",1,read this

We first downloaded a gene expression profile dataset GSE29721 (10 HCC and 10 control samples) from Gene Expression Omnibus database (http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/). Differentially expressed genes (DEGs) were identified by the paired t-test using limma package. Pathway and functional enrichment analyses were performed with DAVID tools. Transcription factors were annotated with TRANSFAC database and tumor associated genes (TAGs) were annotated with TAG and TSGene databases. Protein-protein interaction (PPI) network was conducted using STRING online tool and function module was further identified with BioNet package. Totally, 527 up-regulated DEGs and 587 down-regulated DEGs were identified. GO functional and KEGG pathway enrichment analyses showed that the up-regulated DEGs were mainly related to cell division and cell cycle, while the down-regulated DEGs were largely related to material metabolism, especially secondary metabolism. Proteins encoded by DEGs CDK1, BUB1, CDC20, NCAPG, NDC80, CDCA8, MAD2L1, CCNB1, CCNA2 and BIRC5 were hub genes with high degrees in the PPI network; further module analysis detected a subnetwork consisting of 55 proteins, such as CYP2B6, ACAA1, BHMT and ALDH2. Taken together, aberrant expression of cell cycle related genes (e.g., CDK1, CCNA2, CCNB1, BUB1, MAD2L1 and CDC20) and material metabolism related genes (e.g., CYP2B6, ACAA1, BHMT and ALDH2) may contribute to HCC occurrence.",0,references other data resource

H. vitripennis is highly polyphagous and voracious, feeding on at least 100 plant species and consuming up to 100 times its weight in xylem fluid daily. The insect is a vector of the phytopathogen Xylella fastidiosa (Wells), which is the causative agent of Pierce's disease in grapevines. To evaluate the microbial flora associated with H. vitripennis, total DNA extracts from hemolymph, alimentary canal excretions, and whole insect bodies were subjected to 16S rDNA pyrosequencing using the bTEFAP methodology and the resulting sequences (370-520 bp in length) were compared with a curated high quality 16S database derived from GenBank http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov. Species from the genera Wolbachia, Delftia (formerly Pseudomonas), Pectobacterium, Moraxella, Serratia, Bacillus, and many others were detected and a comprehensive picture of the microbiome associated with H. vitripennis was established. Some of the bacteria identified in this report are initial discoveries; providing a breadth of knowledge to the microbial flora of this insect pest can serve as a reservoir of information for developing biological control strategies.",0,references other data resource
33976872,Analysis of tRNA <sup>Cys</sup> processing under salt stress in <i>Bacillus subtilis</i> spore outgrowth using RNA sequencing data.,"<b>Background:</b> In spore-forming bacteria, the molecular mechanisms of accumulation of transfer RNA (tRNA) during sporulation must be a priority as tRNAs play an essential role in protein synthesis during spore germination and outgrowth. However, tRNA processing has not been extensively studied in these conditions, and knowledge of these mechanisms is important to understand long-term stress survival.††† <b>Methods:</b>To gain further insight into tRNA processing during spore germination and outgrowth, the expression of the single copy tRNA <sup>Cys</sup> gene was analyzed in the presence and absence of 1.2 M NaCl in <i>Bacillus subtilis</i> using RNA-Seq data obtained from the Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) database. The CLC Genomics work bench 12.0.2 (CLC Bio, Aarhus, Denmark, https://www.qiagenbioinformatics.com/) was used to analyze reads from the tRNA <sup>Cys</sup> gene.† <b>Results:</b>The results show that spores store different populations of tRNA <sup>Cys</sup>-related molecules.† One such population, representing 60% of total tRNA <sup>Cys</sup>, was composed of tRNA <sup>Cys</sup> fragments.† Half of these fragments (3¥-tRF) possessed CC, CCA or incorrect additions at the 3¥end. tRNA <sup>Cys</sup> with correct CCA addition at the 3¥end represented 23% of total tRNA <sup>Cys</sup>, while with CC addition represented 9% of the total and with incorrect addition represented 7%. While an accumulation of tRNA <sup>Cys</sup> precursors was induced by upregulation of the <i>rrnD</i> operon under the control of† s <sup>A</sup> -dependent promoters under both conditions investigated, salt stress produced only a modest effect on tRNA <sup>Cys</sup> expression and the accumulation of tRNA <sup>Cys</sup> related species. <b>Conclusions</b>:The results demonstrate that tRNA <sup>Cys</sup> molecules resident in spores undergo dynamic processing to produce functional molecules that may play an essential role during protein synthesis.",0,references other data resource
25840970,Global Transcriptional Changes Following Statin Treatment in Breast Cancer.,"<h4>Background</h4>Statins purportedly exert antitumoral effects, but the underlying mechanisms are currently not fully elucidated. The aim of this study was to explore potential statin-induced effects on global gene expression profiles in primary breast cancer.<h4>Experimental design</h4>This window-of-opportunity phase II trial enrolled 50 newly diagnosed breast cancer patients prescribed atorvastatin (80 mg/day) for 2 weeks presurgically. Pre- and posttreatment tumor samples were analyzed using Significance Analysis of Microarrays (SAM) to identify differentially expressed genes. Similarly, SAM and gene ontology analyses were applied to gene expression data derived from atorvastatin-treated breast cancer cell lines (MCF7, BT474, SKBR3, and MDAMB231) comparing treated and untreated cells. The Systematic Motif Analysis Retrieval Tool (SMART) was used to identify enriched transcription factor-binding sites. Literature Vector Analysis (LitVAn) identified gene module functionality, and pathway analysis was performed using GeneGo Pathways Software (MetaCore; https://portal.genego.com/).<h4>Results</h4>Comparative analysis of gene expression profiles in paired clinical samples revealed 407 significantly differentially expressed genes (FDR = 0); 32 upregulated and 375 downregulated genes. Restricted filtration (fold change =1.49) resulted in 21 upregulated and 46 downregulated genes. Significantly upregulated genes included DUSP1, RHOB1, GADD45B, and RGS1. Pooled results from gene ontology, LitVAn and SMART analyses identified statin-induced effects on the apoptotic and MAPK pathways among others. Comparative analyses of gene expression profiles in breast cancer cell lines showed significant upregulation of the mevalonate and proapoptotic pathways following atorvastatin treatment.<h4>Conclusions</h4>We report potential statin-induced changes in global tumor gene expression profiles, indicating MAPK pathway inhibition and proapoptotic events.",0,references other data resource
26981408,De novo transcriptome assembly of two contrasting pumpkin cultivars.,"Cucurbita pepo (squash, pumpkin, gourd), a worldwide-cultivated vegetable of American origin, is extremely variable in fruit characteristics. However, the information associated with genes and genetic markers for pumpkin is very limited. In order to identify new genes and to develop genetic markers, we performed a transcriptome analysis (RNA-Seq) of two contrasting pumpkin cultivars. Leaves and female flowers of cultivars, 'Big Moose' with large round fruits and 'Munchkin' with small round fruits, were harvested for total RNA extraction. We obtained a total of 6†GB (Big Moose; http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/Traces/sra/?run=SRR3056882) and 5†GB (Munchkin; http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/Traces/sra/?run=SRR3056883) sequence data (NCBI SRA database SRX1502732 and SRX1502735, respectively), which correspond to 18,055,786 and 14,824,292 150-base reads. After quality assessment, the clean sequences where 17,995,932 and 14,774,486 respectively. The numbers of total transcripts for 'Big Moose' and 'Munchkin' were 84,727 and 68,051, respectively. TransDecoder identified possible coding regions in assembled transcripts.

Online miRNA database (http://www.bioguo.org) was utilized to explore gene polymorphism in MMP9 3'UTR that might break the interaction between MMP9 and miRNA. Luciferase assay was utilized to confirm the miRNA targeted MMP9. Real-time PCR, western†blot analysis and immunohistochemistry were carried out to understand the roles of MMP9 in PU as well as how rs1056629 in MMP9 3'UTR compromises the interaction between MMP9 and miR-491. rs1056629 in MMP9 3'UTR that compromised the interaction between MMP9 and four miRNAs including miR-194-3p, miR-491, miR-1915-3p and miR-941, and only miR-491 among miR-194-3p, miR-491, miR-1915-3p and miR-941 decreased luciferase activity of wild-type MMP9 3'UTR, and luciferase activities of mutant-3 and mutant-4 MMP9 3'UTR in miR-491 overexpressing cells was comparable with scramble control. miR-194-3p, miR-491, miR-1915-3p and miR-941 levels in PU group was comparable with healthy control, and miR-194-3p, miR-491, miR-1915-3p and miR-941 in subjects carrying AA genotype was similar with those in AC and CC groups. MMP9 mRNA and protein, and histology score in subjects with PU were much higher, and were also much higher in AA group. Only miR-491 mimic among miR-194-3p, miR-491, miR-1915-3p and miR-941 mimics downregulated the MMP9 level, and only miR-491 inhibitor among miR-194-3p, miR-491, miR-1915-3p and miR-941 inhibitors upregulated the MMP9 level. Our study indicated that rs1056629 polymorphism could be a novel biomarker for predicting the occurrence of PU after a hip fracture.",0,references other data resource
22417303,Infrequent p53 gene mutation but UV gradient-like p53 protein positivity in keloids.,"Keloids are characterized by extreme fibroblastic overgrowth of unknown pathogenesis after skin injury. Previous studies, mostly in non-Caucasian populations, suggest that p53 mutations may be involved. To substantiate this, we performed DNA sequence analysis of exons 4-8 of the p53 gene and immunohistochemical staining of p53 protein in archived keloidal tissue samples from 23 Caucasian patients. In contrast to previous reports, we found mutated p53 in keloidal tissue in a minority of cases (2/23; 12%). The G allele frequency and C allele frequency at the p53 polymorphic codon 72 were 0.72 (33/46) and 0.28 (13/46), respectively, in our study, a finding that was similar to the 0.77 (184/240) vs. 0.23 (56/240) (P = 0.4580; chi-squared test) observed in the Hap Map data of a European population but statistically significantly different from the 0.43 (547/1258) vs. 0.57 (711/1258) (P = 0.0002; chi-squared test) observed in the 1000 Genome project [Database of Single Nucleotide Polymorphisms (dbSNP).

Available from: (http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/SNP/] a difference most likely due to the different genetic background of the populations enrolled. However, one-third of the keloidal samples showed lesional nuclear p53 staining with a UV penetration gradient-like positivity (P = 0.0084). Staining with an anti-cyclobutane pyrimidine dimer antibody revealed the total absence of short-term photoproducts in the epidermis as well as keloidal tissue. Furthermore, all fibroblasts expressing p53 stained negative for Ki-67, indicating that these cells were in a quiescent stage and p53 upregulation did not contribute to keloidal proliferation. We conclude that p53 plays no major role in the pathogenesis of keloids in the Caucasian population.",0,references other data resource
30560246,Glioma and Alzheimer's Disease.,"Background:Cancer mortality and Alzheimer's disease (AD) mortality increase with age, but some studies have shown an inverse relationship of the two diseases, that is, older persons with cancer have a reduced risk of AD and vice versa. However, other analyses suggest that AD and brain tumor might be positively correlated. Objective:In the current study, we wished to determine the relationship of AD mortality to malignant brain tumor mortality in US states and counties. Methods:Data and maps of malignant brain tumor mortality and Alzheimer's disease mortality (1999-2016) are from the CDC Wonder tool (https://wonder.cdc.gov/cmf-icd10.html). Data on malignant brain tumor types and their frequencies are from the Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results Program (SEER, https://seer.cancer.gov). Data on the genetics of lower grade glioma are from the TCGA Lower Grade Glioma (LGG) dataset in TCGA (The Cancer Genome Atlas). Results:SEER data indicate that astrocytomas make up 58.2% of malignant brain tumors in patients 65 and older; glioblastoma and anaplastic astrocytoma make up 41.6%. We found a significant positive correlation between AD mortality rate and malignant brain tumor mortality rate 1999-2016 in persons age 65 and older in A) 1,101 US counties, p <  0.001 and B) 50 US states, p <  0.001. Conclusion:Adult malignant brain tumors may share some environmental risks with AD. Malignant brain tumors and AD also have some genes in common: TREM2, SPI1, CD33, and INPP5D. The interaction of environment and genetics is complex and overlaps in malignant brain tumors and AD.",0,references other data resource
24889386,Imported Plasmodium vivax malaria ex Pakistan.,"<h4>Background</h4>According to WHO, 1.5 million cases of malaria are reported annually in Pakistan. Malaria distribution in Pakistan is heterogeneous, and some areas, including Punjab, are considered at low risk for malaria. The aim of this study is to describe the trend of imported malaria cases from Pakistan reported to the international surveillance systems from 2005 to 2012.<h4>Methods</h4>Clinics reporting malaria cases acquired after a stay in Pakistan between January 1, 2005, and December 31, 2012, were identified from the GeoSentinel (http://www.geosentinel.org) and EuroTravNet (http://www.Eurotravnet.eu) networks. Demographic and travel-related information was retrieved from the database and further information such as areas of destination within Pakistan was obtained directly from the reporting sites. Standard linear regression models were used to assess the statistical significance of the time trend.<h4>Results</h4>From January 2005 to December 2012, a total of 63 cases of malaria acquired in Pakistan were retrieved in six countries over three continents. A statistically significant increasing trend in imported Plasmodium vivax malaria cases acquired in Pakistan, particularly for those exposed in Punjab, was observed over time (p = 0.006).<h4>Conclusions</h4>Our observation may herald a variation in malaria incidence in the Punjab province of Pakistan. This is in contrast with the previously described decreasing incidence of malaria in travelers to the Indian subcontinent, and with reports that describe Punjab as a low risk area for malaria. Nevertheless, this event is considered plausible by international organizations. This has potential implications for changes in chemoprophylaxis options and reinforces the need for increased surveillance, also considering the risk of introduction of autochthonous P. vivax malaria in areas where competent vectors are present, such as Europe.",0,references other data resource
28787666,ERas is constitutively expressed in full term placenta of pregnant cows.,"ERas is a new gene recently found in mouse embryonic stem (ES) cells and localized on the X chromosome. It plays a role in mouse ES cell survival and is constitutively active without any mutations. It was also found to be responsible for the maintenance of quiescence of the hepatic stellate cells (HSCs), liver-resident mesenchymal stem cells, the activation of which results in liver fibrosis. This gene was not present in human ES cells. ERas was found to be activated in a significant population of human gastric cancer, where ERAS may play a crucial role in gastric cancer cell survival and metastases to liver via down-regulation of E-cadherin. ERas gene has been found to be expressed both in ES cells and adult tissues of cynomolgus monkey. Cynomolgus ERAS did not promote cell proliferation or induce tumor formation. ERAS was also detected in normal and neoplastic urothelium of the urinary bladder in cattle, where bovine ERAS formed a constitutive complex with platelet derived growth factor ﬂ receptor (PDGFﬂR) resulting in the activation of AKT signaling. Here, molecular and morphological findings of ERAS in the full term placenta of pregnant cows have been investigated for the first time. ERAS was studied by reverse transcriptase PCR (RT-PCR). Alignment of the sequence detects a 100% identity with all transcript variant bovine ERas mRNAs, present in the GenBank database (http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov). Furthermore, ERAS was detected by Western blot and investigated by real time PCR that revealed an amount of ERAS more than ERAS found in normal bovine urothelium but less than ERAS present in the liver. Immunohistochemical examination revealed the presence of ERAS protein both at the level of plasma membrane and in cytoplasm of epithelial cells lining caruncular crypts and in trophoblasts of villi. An evident ERAS immunoreactivity was also seen throughout the chorionic and uterine gland epithelium. Although this is not a functional study and further investigations will be warranted, it is conceivable that ERAS may have pleiotropic effects in the placenta, some of which, like normal urothelial cells, might lead to activation of AKT pathway. We speculate that ERAS may play a key role in cellular processes such as cell differentiation and movement. Accordingly, we believe it may be an important factor involved in trophoblast invasiveness via AKT signaling pathway. Therefore, ERas gene is a functional gene which contributes to homeostasis of bovine placenta.",0,references other data resource

To ensure that data for retail beef cuts in USDA's National Nutrient Database for Standard Reference (SR) are current, a comprehensive, nationwide, multi-phase study was conducted. Samples were collected and analyzed in three phases based on primal category. Using a statistically based sampling plan, 72 beef carcasses per phase were obtained with nationally representative quality and yield grades, genders and genetic types. Retail cuts were fabricated, cooked and dissected to obtain component weights. Nutrient values were determined by validated laboratories using quality assurance procedures. Full nutrient profiles were made available in SR (http://www.ars.usda.gov/nutrientdata). Results for 16 beef retail cuts were compared for cooking yield and protein, fat and moisture concentrations. For example, cooked fat levels differed among three roasted cuts and among three grilled cuts from chuck, rib and loin (p<0.01). Cooking yield for roasted ribeye (76%) was lower (p<0.001) than for grilled ribeye (83%) or for chuck eye grilled (80%) or roasted (84%). This study demonstrates the importance of maintaining data for a variety of retail beef cuts due to their unique properties and different cooking methods.",0,references other data resource

Resulting HCC modulated genes were subsequently compared with different non-tumor tissue samples. Two related signatures were identified, namely ""HCC-associated"" and ""HCC-specific"". Expression data were validated by RNA-Seq analysis carried out on unrelated HCC samples and protein expression was confirmed according to The Human Protein Atlas"" (http://proteinatlas.org/), a public repository of immunohistochemistry data. Among all, aldo-keto reductase family 1 member B10, and IGF2 mRNA-binding protein 3 were found strictly HCC-specific with no expression in 18/20 normal tissues. Target peptides for vaccine design were predicted for both proteins associated with the most prevalent HLA-class I and II alleles. The described novel strategy showed to be feasible for identification of HCC-specific proteins as highly potential target for HCC immunotherapy.",0,references other data resource
34210950,Exploration of the Important Role of Microfibril-Associated Protein 4 Gene in Oral Squamous Cell Carcinoma.,"BACKGROUND Oral squamous cell carcinoma (OSCC) is a common tumor of the head and neck. Its treatment usually requires multiple modalities. Currently, there are no molecular biomarkers to guide these treatment strategies. Studies have shown that microfibril-associated protein 4 (MFAP4) is potentially useful for non-invasive assessment of various diseases; however, its biological function in tumors is still unknown. In this study, we propose that MFAP4 is a new prognostic target for OSCC. MATERIAL AND METHODS First, we collected OSCC data (GSE25099 and GSE30784 datasets) from the Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) database and compared the differential expression of MFAP4 gene between the patients (tumor) and normal (control) groups. The comparison was done with University of California Santa Cruz Xena (https://xenabrowser.net/Datapages/), and we calculated the difference in MFAP4 gene expression between normal and tumor tissues in a pan-cancer analysis. Then, we compared the 2 groups with high and low expression of MFAP4 gene in terms of tumor mutation burden (TMB), miRNA regulation, and immune cell infiltration. RESULTS We found that the expression of MFAP4 gene was significantly decreased in tumors. Our research also showed that high expression of MFAP4 was related to better prognosis of patients and may be related to tumor gene mutation, miRNA regulation, and infiltration of different immune cells. CONCLUSIONS Our work provides evidence that expression of MFAP4 can be used as a prognostic biomarker for risk stratification of OSCC patients and elaborates on its relation with the regulation of TMB, miRNAs, and immune cell infiltration.",0,references other data resource
26631838,"Relative Prognostic and Predictive Value of Gene Signature and Histologic Grade in Estrogen Receptor-Positive, HER2-Negative Breast Cancer.","<h4>Background</h4>In estrogen receptor (ER)-positive, human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2)-negative breast cancer, first-generation genomic signatures serve predominately as prognostic biomarkers and secondarily as predictors of response to chemotherapy. We compared both the prognostic and predictive value of histologic grades and genomic markers.<h4>Methods</h4>We retrieved publicly available cDNA microarray data from 1373 primary ER(+)/HER2(-) breast cancers and developed a genomic signature simulated from Recurrence Online (http://www.recurrenceonline.com/) to calculate the recurrence score and risk using predefined sets of genes in the cDNA microarray. We then compared the prognostic and predictive information provided by histologic grade and genomic signature.<h4>Results</h4>Based on genomic signatures, 55%, 28%, and 17% of breast cancers were classified as low, intermediate, and high risk, respectively, whereas the histologic grades were I, II, and III in 22%, 59%, and 19% of breast cancers, respectively. Univariate analysis in the untreated cohort revealed that both histologic grade (overall P = .007) and genomic signature (P < .001) could predict prognosis. Results were similar using the genomic signature, with pathologic complete response rates of 4.6%, 5.7%, and 16.5% for low-, intermediate-, and high-risk cancers, respectively. Neither biomarker was statistically significant in multivariate analysis for predictive response to neoadjuvant chemotherapy (NAC).<h4>Conclusion</h4>Genomic signature was better at identifying low-risk cases compared to histologic grade alone, but both markers had similar predictive values for NAC response. Better predictive biomarkers for NAC response are still needed.",0,references other data resource
24678734,Research resource: EPSLiM: ensemble predictor for short linear motifs in nuclear hormone receptors.,"Nuclear receptors (NRs) are a superfamily of transcription factors central to regulating many biological processes, including cell growth, death, metabolism, and immune responses. NR-mediated gene expression can be modulated by coactivators and corepressors through direct physical interaction or protein complexes with functional domains in NRs. One class of these domains includes short linear motifs (SLiMs), which facilitate protein-protein interactions, phosphorylation, and ligand binding primarily in the intrinsically disordered regions (IDRs) of proteins. Across all proteins, the number of known SLiMs is limited due to the difficulty in studying IDRs experimentally. Computational tools provide a systematic and data-driven approach for predicting functional motifs that can be used to prioritize experimental efforts. Accordingly, several tools have been developed based on sequence conservation or biophysical features; however, discrepancies in predictions make it difficult to determine the true candidate SLiMs. In this work, we present the ensemble predictor for short linear motifs (EPSLiM), a novel strategy to prioritize the residues that are most likely to be SLiMs in IDRs. EPSLiM applies a generalized linear model to integrate predictions from individual methodologies. We show that EPSLiM outperforms individual predictors, and we apply our method to NRs. The androgen receptor is an example with an N-terminal domain of 559 disordered amino acids that contains several validated SLiMs important for transcriptional activation. We use the androgen receptor to illustrate the predictive performance of EPSLiM and make the results of all human and mouse NRs publically available through the web service http://epslim.bwh.harvard.edu.",1,resulting data is what's available
25161233,TEMPI: probabilistic modeling time-evolving differential PPI networks with multiPle information.,"<h4>Motivation</h4>Time-evolving differential protein-protein interaction (PPI) networks are essential to understand serial activation of differentially regulated (up- or downregulated) cellular processes (DRPs) and their interplays over time. Despite developments in the network inference, current methods are still limited in identifying temporal transition of structures of PPI networks, DRPs associated with the structural transition and the interplays among the DRPs over time.<h4>Results</h4>Here, we present a probabilistic model for estimating Time-Evolving differential PPI networks with MultiPle Information (TEMPI). This model describes probabilistic relationships among network structures, time-course gene expression data and Gene Ontology biological processes (GOBPs). By maximizing the likelihood of the probabilistic model, TEMPI estimates jointly the time-evolving differential PPI networks (TDNs) describing temporal transition of PPI network structures together with serial activation of DRPs associated with transiting networks. This joint estimation enables us to interpret the TDNs in terms of temporal transition of the DRPs. To demonstrate the utility of TEMPI, we applied it to two time-course datasets. TEMPI identified the TDNs that correctly delineated temporal transition of DRPs and time-dependent associations between the DRPs. These TDNs provide hypotheses for mechanisms underlying serial activation of key DRPs and their temporal associations.<h4>Availability and implementation</h4>Source code and sample data files are available at http://sbm.postech.ac.kr/tempi/sources.zip.<h4>Supplementary information</h4>Supplementary data are available at Bioinformatics online.",0,sample data only
34003431,The C-BIG Repository: an Institution-Level Open Science Platform.,"In January 2016, the Montreal Neurological Institute-Hospital (The Neuro) declared itself an Open Science organization. This vision extends beyond efforts by individual scientists seeking to release individual datasets, software tools, or building platforms that provide for the free dissemination of such information. It involves multiple stakeholders and an infrastructure that considers governance, ethics, computational resourcing, physical design, workflows, training, education, and intra-institutional reporting structures. The C-BIG repository was built in response as The Neuro's institutional biospecimen and clinical data repository, and collects biospecimens as well as clinical, imaging, and genetic data from patients with neurological disease and healthy controls. It is aimed at helping scientific investigators, in both academia and industry, advance our understanding of neurological diseases and accelerate the development of treatments. As many neurological diseases are quite rare, they present several challenges to researchers due to their small patient populations. Overcoming these challenges required the aggregation of datasets from various projects and locations. The C-BIG repository achieves this goal and stands as a scalable working model for institutions to collect, track, curate, archive, and disseminate multimodal data from patients. In November 2020, a Registered Access layer was made available to the wider research community at https://cbigr-open.loris.ca , and in May†2021 fully open data will be released to complement the Registered Access data. This article outlines many of the aspects of The Neuro's transition to Open Science by describing the data to be released, C-BIG's full capabilities, and the design aspects that were implemented for effective data sharing.",0,scope

Pore-lining residues (PLRs) that make direct contacts to the substrates have a crucial impact on the function of the protein and, hence, their identification is a key step in mechanistic studies. Here, we established a nonredundant data set containing the three-dimensional (3D) structures of 90 a-helical transmembrane proteins and annotated the PLRs of these proteins by a pore identification software. A support vector machine was then trained to distinguish PLRs from other residues based on the protein sequence alone. Using sixfold cross-validation, our best performing predictor gave a Matthews's correlation coefficient of 0.41 with an accuracy of 0.86, sensitivity of 0.61, and specificity of 0.89, respectively.

A nested phylogenetic reconstruction approach provides scalable resolution in the eukaryotic Tree Of Life. PeerJ PrePrints 2:223) Our study reveals that each species tree suggests a different phylogeny: 87 of the 146 (60%) possible splits of a dichotomous and rooted tree are congruent, while all other splits are incongruent in at least one of the species trees. Topological differences are observed not only at deep speciation events, but also within younger clades, such as Hominidae, Rodentia, Laurasiatheria, or rosids. The evolutionary relationships of 27 archaea and bacteria are highly inconsistent. By assessing 458,108 gene trees from 65 genomes, we show that consistent species topologies are more often supported by gene phylogenies than contradicting ones.

It is an updated version of AlgPred developed in 2006. The dataset used for training, testing and validation consists of 10†075 allergens and 10†075 non-allergens. In addition, 10†451 experimentally validated immunoglobulin E (IgE) epitopes were used to identify antigenic regions in a protein. All models were trained on 80% of data called training dataset, and the performance of models was evaluated using 5-fold cross-validation technique. The performance of the final model trained on the training dataset was evaluated on 20% of data called validation dataset; no two proteins in any two sets have more than 40% similarity. First, a Basic Local Alignment Search Tool (BLAST) search has been performed against the dataset, and allergens were predicted based on the level of similarity with known allergens. Second, IgE epitopes obtained from the IEDB database were searched in the dataset to predict allergens based on their presence in a protein. Third, motif-based approaches like multiple EM for motif elicitation/motif alignment and search tool have been used to predict allergens. Fourth, allergen prediction models have been developed using a wide range of machine learning techniques. Finally, the ensemble approach has been used for predicting allergenic protein by combining prediction scores of different approaches. Our best model achieved maximum performance in terms of area under receiver operating characteristic curve 0.98 with Matthew's correlation coefficient 0.85 on the validation dataset.

27554092,Training and evaluation corpora for the extraction of causal relationships encoded in biological expression language (BEL).,"Success in extracting biological relationships is mainly dependent on the complexity of the task as well as the availability of high-quality training data. Here, we describe the new corpora in the systems biology modeling language BEL for training and testing biological relationship extraction systems that we prepared for the BioCreative V BEL track. BEL was designed to capture relationships not only between proteins or chemicals, but also complex events such as biological processes or disease states. A BEL nanopub is the smallest unit of information and represents a biological relationship with its provenance. In BEL relationships (called BEL statements), the entities are normalized to defined namespaces mainly derived from public repositories, such as sequence databases, MeSH or publicly available ontologies. In the BEL nanopubs, the BEL statements are associated with citation information and supportive evidence such as a text excerpt. To enable the training of extraction tools, we prepared BEL resources and made them available to the community. We selected a subset of these resources focusing on a reduced set of namespaces, namely, human and mouse genes, ChEBI chemicals, MeSH diseases and GO biological processes, as well as relationship types 'increases' and 'decreases'. The published training corpus contains 11 000 BEL statements from over 6000 supportive text excerpts. For method evaluation, we selected and re-annotated two smaller subcorpora containing 100 text excerpts. For this re-annotation, the inter-annotator agreement was measured by the BEL track evaluation environment and resulted in a maximal F-score of 91.18% for full statement agreement. In addition, for a set of 100 BEL statements, we do not only provide the gold standard expert annotations, but also text excerpts pre-selected by two automated systems. Those text excerpts were evaluated and manually annotated as true or false supportive in the course of the BioCreative V BEL track task.Database URL: http://wiki.openbel.org/display/BIOC/Datasets.",1,value add and available
27484196,iLIR database: A web resource for LIR motif-containing proteins in eukaryotes.,"Atg8-family proteins are the best-studied proteins of the core autophagic machinery. They are essential for the elongation and closure of the phagophore into a proper autophagosome. Moreover, Atg8-family proteins are associated with the phagophore from the initiation of the autophagic process to, or just prior to, the fusion between autophagosomes with lysosomes. In addition to their implication in autophagosome biogenesis, they are crucial for selective autophagy through their ability to interact with selective autophagy receptor proteins necessary for the specific targeting of substrates for autophagic degradation. In the past few years it has been revealed that Atg8-interacting proteins include not only receptors but also components of the core autophagic machinery, proteins associated with vesicles and their transport, and specific proteins that are selectively degraded by autophagy. Atg8-interacting proteins contain a short linear LC3-interacting region/LC3 recognition sequence/Atg8-interacting motif (LIR/LRS/AIM) motif which is responsible for their interaction with Atg8-family proteins. These proteins are referred to as LIR-containing proteins (LIRCPs). So far, many experimental efforts have been carried out to identify new LIRCPs, leading to the characterization of some of them in the past 10†years. Given the need for the identification of LIRCPs in various organisms, we developed the iLIR database ( https://ilir.warwick.ac.uk ) as a freely available web resource, listing all the putative canonical LIRCPs identified in silico in the proteomes of 8 model organisms using the iLIR server, combined with a Gene Ontology (GO) term analysis. Additionally, a curated text-mining analysis of the literature permitted us to identify novel putative LICRPs in mammals that have not previously been associated with autophagy.",1,value add and available
29161266,Knowledge-based prediction of protein backbone conformation using a structural alphabet.,"Libraries of structural prototypes that abstract protein local structures are known as structural alphabets and have proven to be very useful in various aspects of protein structure analyses and predictions. One such library, Protein Blocks, is composed of 16 standard 5-residues long structural prototypes. This form of analyzing proteins involves drafting its structure as a string of Protein Blocks. Predicting the local structure of a protein in terms of protein blocks is the general objective of this work. A new approach, PB-kPRED is proposed towards this aim. It involves (i) organizing the structural knowledge in the form of a database of pentapeptide fragments extracted from all protein structures in the PDB and (ii) applying a knowledge-based algorithm that does not rely on any secondary structure predictions and/or sequence alignment profiles, to scan this database and predict most probable backbone conformations for the protein local structures. Though PB-kPRED uses the structural information from homologues in preference, if available. The predictions were evaluated rigorously on 15,544 query proteins representing a non-redundant subset of the PDB filtered at 30% sequence identity cut-off. We have shown that the kPRED method was able to achieve mean accuracies ranging from 40.8% to 66.3% depending on the availability of homologues. The impact of the different strategies for scanning the database on the prediction was evaluated and is discussed. Our results highlight the usefulness of the method in the context of proteins without any known structural homologues. A scoring function that gives a good estimate of the accuracy of prediction was further developed. This score estimates very well the accuracy of the algorithm (R2 of 0.82).

QIIME 2 facilitates comprehensive and fully reproducible microbiome data science, improving accessibility to diverse users by adding multiple user interfaces. QIIME 2 can be combined with Qiita, an open-source web-based platform, to re-use available data for meta-analysis. The following basic protocol describes how to install QIIME 2 on a single computer and analyze microbiome sequence data, from processing of raw DNA sequence reads through generating publishable interactive figures. These interactive figures allow readers of a study to interact with data with the same ease as its authors, advancing microbiome science transparency and reproducibility. We also show how plug-ins developed by the community to add analysis capabilities can be installed and used with QIIME 2, enhancing various aspects of microbiome analyses-e.g., improving taxonomic classification accuracy. Finally, we illustrate how users can perform meta-analyses combining different datasets using readily available public data through Qiita. In this tutorial, we analyze a subset of the Early Childhood Antibiotics and the Microbiome (ECAM) study, which tracked the microbiome composition and development of 43 infants in the United States from birth to 2 years of age, identifying microbiome associations with antibiotic exposure, delivery mode, and diet.

33789926,A Novel Three-Choice Touchscreen Task to Examine Spatial Attention and Orienting Responses in Rodents.,"Mammalian orienting behavior consists of coordinated movements of the eyes, head, pinnae, vibrissae, or body to attend to an external stimulus. The present study aimed to develop a novel operant task using a touch-screen system to measure spatial attention. In this task, rats were trained to nose-poke a light stimulus presented in one of three locations. The stimulus was presented more frequently in the center location to develop spatial attention bias toward the center stimulus. Changes in orienting responses were detected by measuring the animals' response accuracy and latency to stimuli at the lateral locations, following reversible unilateral chemogenetic inactivation of the superior colliculus (SC). Additionally, spontaneous turning and rotation behavior was measured using an open-field test (OFT). Our results show that right SC inactivation significantly increased the whole body turn angle in the OFT, in line with previous literature that indicated an ipsiversive orientating bias and the presence of contralateral neglect following unilateral SC lesions. In the touch screen orienting task, unilateral SC inactivation significantly increased bias toward the ipsilateral side, as measured by response frequency in various experimental conditions, and a very large left-shift of a respective psychometric function. Our results demonstrate that this novel touchscreen task is able to detect changes in spatial attention and orienting responses because of e.g. experimental manipulations or injury with very high sensitivity, while taking advantage of the touch screen technology that allows for high transferability of the task between labs and for open-source data sharing through https://www.mousebytes.ca.",1,"yes,  not well conveyed in the abstract"
21998156,Extraction of data deposition statements from the literature: a method for automatically tracking research results.,"<h4>Motivation</h4>Research in the biomedical domain can have a major impact through open sharing of the data produced. For this reason, it is important to be able to identify instances of data production and deposition for potential re-use. Herein, we report on the automatic identification of data deposition statements in research articles.<h4>Results</h4>We apply machine learning algorithms to sentences extracted from full-text articles in PubMed Central in order to automatically determine whether a given article contains a data deposition statement, and retrieve the specific statements. With an Support Vector Machine classifier using conditional random field determined deposition features, articles containing deposition statements are correctly identified with 81% F-measure. An error analysis shows that almost half of the articles classified as containing a deposition statement by our method but not by the gold standard do indeed contain a deposition statement. In addition, our system was used to process articles in PubMed Central, predicting that a total of 52 932 articles report data deposition, many of which are not currently included in the Secondary Source Identifier [si] field for MEDLINE citations.<h4>Availability</h4>All annotated datasets described in this study are freely available from the NLM/NCBI website at http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/CBBresearch/Fellows/Neveol/DepositionDataSets.zip<h4>Contact</h4>aurelie.neveol@nih.gov; john.wilbur@nih.gov; zhiyong.lu@nih.gov<h4>Supplementary information</h4>Supplementary data are available at Bioinformatics online.",0,zip
23271269,Inference of gene regulatory networks from genome-wide knockout fitness data.,"<h4>Motivation</h4>Genome-wide fitness is an emerging type of high-throughput biological data generated for individual organisms by creating libraries of knockouts, subjecting them to broad ranges of environmental conditions, and measuring the resulting clone-specific fitnesses. Since fitness is an organism-scale measure of gene regulatory network behaviour, it may offer certain advantages when insights into such phenotypical and functional features are of primary interest over individual gene expression. Previous works have shown that genome-wide fitness data can be used to uncover novel gene regulatory interactions, when compared with results of more conventional gene expression analysis. Yet, to date, few algorithms have been proposed for systematically using genome-wide mutant fitness data for gene regulatory network inference.<h4>Results</h4>In this article, we describe a model and propose an inference algorithm for using fitness data from knockout libraries to identify underlying gene regulatory networks. Unlike most prior methods, the presented approach captures not only structural, but also dynamical and non-linear nature of biomolecular systems involved. A state-space model with non-linear basis is used for dynamically describing gene regulatory networks. Network structure is then elucidated by estimating unknown model parameters. Unscented Kalman filter is used to cope with the non-linearities introduced in the model, which also enables the algorithm to run in on-line mode for practical use. Here, we demonstrate that the algorithm provides satisfying results for both synthetic data as well as empirical measurements of GAL network in yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae and TyrR-LiuR network in bacteria Shewanella oneidensis.<h4>Availability</h4>MATLAB code and datasets are available to download at http://www.duke.edu/~lw174/Fitness.zip and http://genomics.lbl.gov/supplemental/fitness-bioinf/",0,zip file
23180799,PGDD: a database of gene and genome duplication in plants.,"Genome duplication (GD) has permanently shaped the architecture and function of many higher eukaryotic genomes. The angiosperms (flowering plants) are outstanding models in which to elucidate consequences of GD for higher eukaryotes, owing to their propensity for chromosomal duplication or even triplication in a few cases. Duplicated genome structures often require both intra- and inter-genome alignments to unravel their evolutionary history, also providing the means to deduce both obvious and otherwise-cryptic orthology, paralogy and other relationships among genes. The burgeoning sets of angiosperm genome sequences provide the foundation for a host of investigations into the functional and evolutionary consequences of gene and GD. To provide genome alignments from a single resource based on uniform standards that have been validated by empirical studies, we built the Plant Genome Duplication Database (PGDD; freely available at http://chibba.agtec.uga.edu/duplication/), a web service providing synteny information in terms of colinearity between chromosomes. At present, PGDD contains data for 26 plants including bryophytes and chlorophyta, as well as angiosperms with draft genome sequences. In addition to the inclusion of new genomes as they become available, we are preparing new functions to enhance PGDD.",1,

It is possible that participant's characteristics measured at baseline can identify people with chronic low back pain who would respond best to a treatment based on the Movement System Impairment model.<h4>Objectives</h4>To assess if specific characteristics of people with chronic low back pain measured at baseline can modify the effects of a treatment based on the Movement System Impairment model on pain and disability.<h4>Methods</h4>Four variables assessed at baseline that could potentially modify the treatment effects of the treatment based on the Movement System Impairment model were selected (age, educational status, physical activity status and STarT back tool classification). Separate univariate models were used to investigate a possible modifier treatment effect of baseline participant's characteristics on pain and disability after the treatment. Findings of interaction values above 1 point for the outcome mean pain intensity or above 3 points for disability (Roland Morris questionnaire) were considered clinically relevant.<h4>Results</h4>Linear regression analyses for the outcomes of pain and disability did not show interaction values considered clinically relevant for age, educational status, physical activity status and STarT back tool classification.<h4>Conclusion</h4>Age, educational status, physical activity status and STarT back tool classification did not modify the effects of an 8-week treatment based on the Movement System Impairment model in patients with chronic low back pain.

23732274,AuthorReward: increasing community curation in biological knowledge wikis through automated authorship quantification.,"<h4>Summary</h4>Community curation-harnessing community intelligence in knowledge curation, bears great promise in dealing with the flood of biological knowledge. To exploit the full potential of the scientific community for knowledge curation, multiple biological wikis (bio-wikis) have been built to date. However, none of them have achieved a substantial impact on knowledge curation. One of the major limitations in bio-wikis is insufficient community participation, which is intrinsically because of lack of explicit authorship and thus no credit for community curation. To increase community curation in bio-wikis, here we develop AuthorReward, an extension to MediaWiki, to reward community-curated efforts in knowledge curation. AuthorReward quantifies researchers' contributions by properly factoring both edit quantity and quality and yields automated explicit authorship according to their quantitative contributions. AuthorReward provides bio-wikis with an authorship metric, helpful to increase community participation in bio-wikis and to achieve community curation of massive biological knowledge.<h4>Availability</h4>http://cbb.big.ac.cn/software.<h4>Contact</h4>zhangzhang@big.ac.cn<h4>Supplementary information</h4>Supplementary data are available at Bioinformatics online.",0,

Here, we survey the field of high-throughput methods for 3-D structure prediction and set up new target specifications for the next generation of methods. We then introduce COSMOS, a novel data-driven prediction method that utilizes libraries of fragment and torsion angle parameters. We illustrate COSMOS using parameters extracted from the Cambridge Structural Database (CSD) by analyzing their distribution and then evaluating the system's performance in terms of speed, coverage, and accuracy. Results show that COSMOS represents a significant improvement when compared to state-of-the-art prediction methods, particularly in terms of coverage of complex molecular structures, including metal-organics. COSMOS can predict structures for 96.4% of the molecules in the CSD (99.6% organic, 94.6% metal-organic), whereas the widely used commercial method CORINA predicts structures for 68.5% (98.5% organic, 51.6% metal-organic). On the common subset of molecules predicted by both methods, COSMOS makes predictions with an average speed per molecule of 0.15 s (0.10 s organic, 0.21 s metal-organic) and an average rmsd of 1.57 ≈ (1.26 ≈ organic, 1.90 ≈ metal-organic), and CORINA makes predictions with an average speed per molecule of 0.13s (0.18s organic, 0.08s metal-organic) and an average rmsd of 1.60 ≈ (1.13 ≈ organic, 2.11 ≈ metal-organic).

33951459,Hotspot identifies informative gene modules across modalities of single-cell genomics.,"Two fundamental aims that emerge when analyzing single-cell RNA-seq data are identifying which genes vary in an informative manner and determining how these genes organize into modules. Here, we propose a general approach to these problems, called ""Hotspot,"" that operates directly on a given metric of cell-cell similarity, allowing for its integration with any method (linear or non-linear) for identifying the primary axes of transcriptional variation between cells. In addition, we show that when using multimodal data, Hotspot can be used to identify genes whose expression reflects alternative notions of similarity between cells, such as physical proximity in a tissue or clonal relatedness in a cell lineage tree. In this manner, we demonstrate that while Hotspot is capable of identifying genes that reflect nuanced transcriptional variability between T helper cells, it can also identify spatially dependent patterns of gene expression in the cerebellum as well as developmentally heritable expression programs during embryogenesis. Hotspot is implemented as an open-source Python package and is available for use at http://www.github.com/yoseflab/hotspot.

The <i>PDX Details</i> module provides comprehensive information on the patient details in table format and can be searched and visualized. Overall, ZenoFishDb v1.1 enables researchers to effectively search, list, and visualize different technical and biological attributes of zebrafish xenotransplantation studies particularly focusing on the new trends that make use of reporters, RNA interference, overexpression, or mutant gene constructs of transplanted cancer cells, stem cells, and PDXs, as well as distinguished host modifications.",1,
29738769,Neutrophils infiltrating pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma indicate higher malignancy and worse prognosis.,"CD177 is considered to represent neutrophils. We analyzed mRNA expression level of CD177 and clinical follow-up survey of PDAC to estimate overall survival (OS) from Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) dataset (GSE21501, containing samples from 102 PDAC patients) by R2 platform (http://r2.amc.nl). We also analyzed correlated genes of CD177 by Gene Ontology (GO) and Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) analysis to predict the potential relationship between neutrophils and prognosis of PDAC. We then performed hematoxylin and eosin (H&E) staining and immunohistochemical staining of surgical specimens to verify infiltration of neutrophils in PDAC tissues. After analyzing mRNA expression data and clinical follow-up survey provided in the GEO dataset (GSE21501, containing samples from 102 PDAC patients) and clinicopathological data of 23 PDAC patients, we demonstrated that CD177 was correlated with poor prognosis. The univariate Kaplan-Meier survival analysis revealed that OS was inversely associated with increased expression of CD177 (P†=†0.012). Expression of phosphodiesterase (PDE)4D was positively related to CD177 in gene correlation analysis (R†=†0.413, P†<†0.001) by R2 platform. H&E staining and immunohistochemistry of CD177 in 23 PDAC surgical samples showed accumulation of neutrophils in the stroma and blood vessels around the cancer cells. In addition, immunohistochemical staining showed that CD177 was highly expressed in the stroma and blood vessels around tumor tissues of PDAC, which was similar to H&E staining. Expression of CD177 can be used to represent infiltration of neutrophils, which may have potential prognostic value in PDAC.",0,
30026590,Adult energy requirements predicted from doubly labeled water.,"<h4>Background</h4>Estimating energy requirements forms an integral part of developing diet and activity interventions. Current estimates often rely on a product of physical activity level (PAL) and a resting metabolic rate (RMR) prediction. PAL estimates, however, typically depend on subjective self-reported activity or a clinician's best guess. Energy-requirement models that do not depend on an input of PAL may provide an attractive alternative.<h4>Methods</h4>Total daily energy expenditure (TEE) measured by doubly labeled water (DLW) and a metabolic chamber from 119 subjects obtained from a database of pre-intervention measurements measured at Pennington Biomedical Research Center were used to develop a metabolic ward and free-living models that predict energy requirements. Graded models, including different combinations of input variables consisting of age, height, weight, waist circumference, body composition, and the resting metabolic rate were developed. The newly developed models were validated and compared to three independent databases.<h4>Results</h4>Sixty-four different linear and nonlinear regression models were developed. The adjusted R<sup>2</sup> for models predicting free-living energy requirements ranged from 0.65 with covariates of age, height, and weight to 0.74 in models that included body composition and RMR. Independent validation R<sup>2</sup> between actual and predicted TEE varied greatly across studies and between genders with higher coefficients of determination, lower bias, slopes closer to 1, and intercepts closer to zero, associated with inclusion of body composition and RMR covariates. The models were programmed into a user-friendly web-based app available at: http://www.pbrc.edu/research-and-faculty/calculators/energy-requirements/ (Video Demo for Reviewers at: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5UKjJeQdODQ ) CONCLUSIONS: Energy-requirement equations that do not require knowledge of activity levels and include all available input variables can provide more accurate baseline estimates.

32266474,Conjunctive reward-place coding properties of dorsal distal CA1 hippocampus cells.,"Autonomous motivated spatial navigation in animals or robots requires the association between spatial location and value. Hippocampal place cells are involved in goal-directed spatial navigation and the consolidation of spatial memories. Recently, Gauthier and Tank (Neuron 99(1):179-193, 2018. https://doi.org/10.1016/j.neuron.2018.06.008) have identified a subpopulation of hippocampal cells selectively activated in relation to rewarded goals. However, the relationship between these cells' spiking activity and goal representation remains elusive. We analyzed data from experiments in which rats underwent five consecutive tasks in which reward locations and spatial context were manipulated. We found CA1 populations with properties continuously ranging from place cells to reward cells. Specifically, we found typical place cells insensitive to reward locations, reward cells that only fired at correct rewarded feeders in each task regardless of context, and ""hybrid cells"" that responded to spatial locations and change of reward locations. Reward cells responded mostly to the reward delivery rather than to its expectation. In addition, we found a small group of neurons that transitioned between place and reward cells properties within the 5-task session. We conclude that some pyramidal cells (if not all) integrate both spatial and reward inputs to various degrees. These results provide insights into the integrative coding properties of CA1 pyramidal cells, focusing on their abilities to carry both spatial and reward information in a mixed and plastic manner. This conjunctive coding property prompts a re-thinking of current computational models of spatial navigation in which hippocampal spatial and subcortical value representations are independent.",0,
25855375,Alterations of Functional Connectivity Among Resting-State Networks in Hypothyroidism.,"Hypothyroidism affects brain functioning as suggested by various neuroimaging studies. The primary focus of the present study was to examine whether hypothyroidism would impact connectivity among resting-state networks (RSNs) using resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging (rsfMRI). Twenty-two patients with hypothyroidism and 22 healthy controls were recruited and scanned using rsfMRI. The data were analysed using independent component analysis and a dual regression approach that was applied on five RSNs that were identified using fsl software (http://fsl.fmrib.ox.ac.uk). Hypothyroid patients showed significantly decreased functional connectivity in the regions of the right frontoparietal network (frontal pole), the medial visual network (lateral occipital gyrus, precuneus cortex and cuneus) and the motor network (precentral gyrus, postcentral gyrus, precuneus cortex, paracingulate gyrus, cingulate gyrus and supramarginal gyrus) compared to healthy controls. The reduced functional connectivity in the right frontoparietal network, the medial visual network and the motor network suggests neurocognitive alterations in hypothyroid patients in the corresponding functions. However, the study would be further continued to investigate the effects of thyroxine treatment and correlation with neurocognitive scores. The findings of the present study provide further interesting insights into our understanding of the action of thyroid hormone on the adult human brain.",0,
32025087,Reassessing Southern Ocean Air-Sea CO2 Flux Estimates With the Addition of Biogeochemical Float Observations.,"New estimates of pCO2 from profiling floats deployed by the Southern Ocean Carbon and Climate Observations and Modeling (SOCCOM) project have demonstrated the importance of wintertime outgassing south of the Polar Front, challenging the accepted magnitude of Southern Ocean carbon uptake (Gray et al., 2018, https://doi:10.1029/2018GL078013). Here, we put 3.5 years of SOCCOM observations into broader context with the global surface carbon dioxide database (Surface Ocean CO2 Atlas, SOCAT) by using the two interpolation methods currently used to assess the ocean models in the Global Carbon Budget (Le QuÈrÈ et al., 2018, https://doi:10.5194/essd-10-2141-2018) to create a ship-only, a float-weighted, and a combined estimate of Southern Ocean carbon fluxes (<35∞S). In our ship-only estimate, we calculate a mean uptake of -1.14 ± 0.19 Pg C/yr for 2015-2017, consistent with prior studies. The float-weighted estimate yields a significantly lower Southern Ocean uptake of -0.35 ± 0.19 Pg C/yr. Subsampling of high-resolution ocean biogeochemical process models indicates that some of the differences between float and ship-only estimates of the Southern Ocean carbon flux can be explained by spatial and temporal sampling differences. The combined ship and float estimate minimizes the root-mean-square pCO2 difference between the mapped product and both data sets, giving a new Southern Ocean uptake of -0.75 ± 0.22 Pg C/yr, though with uncertainties that overlap the ship-only estimate. An atmospheric inversion reveals that a shift of this magnitude in the contemporary Southern Ocean carbon flux must be compensated for by ocean or land sinks within the Southern Hemisphere.",0,
26398339,Small Supernumerary Marker Chromosomes in Human Infertility.,"Small supernumerary marker chromosomes (sSMC) are structurally abnormal chromosomes that cannot be unambiguously identified by banding cytogenetics. The objective of this study was to provide an overview of sSMC frequency and characterization in a context of infertility and to review the literature describing sSMC in relation with male and female infertility. Therefore, a systematic literature review on sSMC associated with infertility was conducted by means of a PubMed literature and a sSMC database (http://ssmc-tl.com/sSMC.html) search. A total of 234 patients with infertility were identified as carriers of sSMC. All chromosomes, except chromosomes 10, 19 and the X, were involved in sSMC, and in 72% the sSMC originated from acrocentric chromosomes. Euchromatic imbalances were caused by the presence of sSMC in 30% of the cases. Putative genes have been identified in only 1.2% of sSMC associated with infertility. The implication of sSMC in infertility could be due to a partial trisomy of some genes but also to mechanical effects perturbing meiosis. Further precise molecular and interphase-architecture studies on sSMC are needed in the future to characterize the relationship between this chromosomal anomaly and human infertility.",0,

We developed the Phenotype Execution and Modeling Architecture (PhEMA, http://projectphema.org) to author and execute standardized computable phenotype algorithms. With PhEMA, we converted an algorithm for benign prostatic hyperplasia, developed for the electronic Medical Records and Genomics network (eMERGE), into a standards-based computable format. Eight sites (7 within eMERGE) received the computable algorithm, and 6 successfully executed it against local data warehouses and/or i2b2 instances.

28130236,H(O)TA: estimation of DNA methylation and hydroxylation levels and efficiencies from time course data.,"<h4>Motivation</h4>Methylation and hydroxylation of cytosines to form 5-methylcytosine (5mC) and 5-hydroxymethylcytosine (5hmC) belong to the most important epigenetic modifications and their vital role in the regulation of gene expression has been widely recognized. Recent experimental techniques allow to infer methylation and hydroxylation levels at CpG dinucleotides but require a sophisticated statistical analysis to achieve accurate estimates.<h4>Results</h4>We present H(O)TA, a software tool based on a stochastic modeling approach, which simultaneously analyzes time course data from hairpin bisulfite sequencing and hairpin oxidative bisulfite sequencing.<h4>Availability and implementation</h4>: https://mosi.uni-saarland.de/HOTA.<h4>Contact</h4>charalampos.kyriakopoulos@uni-saarland.de or verena.wolf@uni-saarland.de.",0,
25260792,Dynamic evolution of clonal epialleles revealed by methclone.,"We describe methclone, a novel method to identify epigenetic loci that harbor large changes in the clonality of their epialleles (epigenetic alleles). Methclone efficiently analyzes genome-wide DNA methylation sequencing data. We quantify the changes using a composition entropy difference calculation and also introduce a new measure of global clonality shift, loci with epiallele shift per million loci covered, which enables comparisons between different samples to gauge overall epiallelic dynamics. Finally, we demonstrate the utility of methclone in capturing functional epiallele shifts in leukemia patients from diagnosis to relapse. Methclone is open-source and freely available at https://code.google.com/p/methclone.",0,
32964354,A novel online calculator predicting short-term postoperative outcomes in patients with metastatic brain tumors.,"<h4>Purpose</h4>Establishing predictors of hospital length of stay (LOS), discharge deposition, and total hospital charges is essential to providing high-quality, value-based care. Though previous research has investigated these outcomes for patients with metastatic brain tumors, there are currently no tools that synthesize such research findings and allow for prediction of these outcomes on a patient-by-patient basis. The present study sought to develop a prediction calculator that uses patient demographic and clinical information to predict extended hospital length of stay, non-routine discharge disposition, and high total hospital charges for patients with metastatic brain tumors.<h4>Methods</h4>Patients undergoing surgery for metastatic brain tumors at a single academic institution were analyzed (2017-2019). Multivariate logistic regression was used to identify independent predictors of extended LOS (> 7†days), non-routine discharge, and high total hospital charges (> $†46,082.63). p < 0.05 was considered statistically significant. C-statistics and the Hosmer-Lemeshow test were used to assess model discrimination and calibration, respectively.<h4>Results</h4>A total of 235 patients were included in our analysis, with a mean age of 62.74†years. The majority of patients were female (52.3%) and Caucasian (76.6%). Our models predicting extended LOS, non-routine discharge, and high hospital charges had optimism-corrected c-statistics > 0.7, and all three models demonstrated adequate calibration (p > 0.05). The final models are available as an online calculator ( https://neurooncsurgery.shinyapps.io/brain_mets_calculator/ ).<h4>Conclusions</h4>Our models predicting postoperative outcomes allow for individualized risk-estimation for patients following surgery for metastatic brain tumors. Our results may be useful in helping clinicians to provide resource-conscious, high-value care.",0,
31095319,PopNetD3-A Network-Based Web Resource for Exploring Population Structure.,"We present PopNetD3, a web tool that provides an integrated approach for the network-based visualization of population structure based on the PopNet clustering framework. Users first submit a tab-delimited file that defines diversity of SNPs across the genome which is subsequently processed by the PopNet backend to define patterns of conservation at the chromosome level. The resulting population structure is visualized through a dedicated D3-based tool, allowing users to interactively examine chromosomal regions predicted to share ancestry. We illustrate the capabilities of PopNetD3 through an analysis of 16 strains of Neisseria gonorrhoeae. PopNetD3 is capable of processing population data sets consisting of hundreds of individuals and is publicly available online at: http://compsysbio.org/popnetd3 Last Accessed: May 17, 2019.",0,
23153250,"MTMDAT-HADDOCK: high-throughput, protein complex structure modeling based on limited proteolysis and mass spectrometry.","<h4>Background</h4>MTMDAT is a program designed to facilitate analysis of mass spectrometry data of proteins and biomolecular complexes that are probed structurally by limited proteolysis. This approach can provide information about stable fragments of multidomain proteins, yield tertiary and quaternary structure data, and help determine the origin of stability changes at the amino acid residue level. Here, we introduce a pipeline between MTMDAT and HADDOCK, that facilitates protein-protein complex structure probing in a high-throughput and highly automated fashion.<h4>Results</h4>A new feature of MTMDAT allows for the direct identification of residues that are involved in complex formation by comparing the mass spectra of bound and unbound proteins after proteolysis. If 3D structures of the unbound components are available, this data can be used to define restraints for data-driven docking to calculate a model of the complex. We describe here a new implementation of MTMDAT, which includes a pipeline to the data-driven docking program HADDOCK, thus streamlining the entire procedure. This addition, together with usability improvements in MTMDAT, enables high-throughput modeling of protein complexes from mass spectrometry data. The algorithm has been validated by using the protein-protein interaction between the ubiquitin-binding domain of proteasome component Rpn13 and ubiquitin. The resulting structural model, based on restraints extracted by MTMDAT from limited proteolysis and modeled by HADDOCK, was compared to the published NMR structure, which relied on twelve unambiguous intermolecular NOE interactions. The MTMDAT-HADDOCK structure was of similar quality to structures generated using only chemical shift perturbation data derived by NMR titration experiments.<h4>Conclusions</h4>The new MTMDAT-HADDOCK pipeline enables direct high-throughput modeling of protein complexes from mass spectrometry data. MTMDAT-HADDOCK can be downloaded from http://www.ifm.liu.se/chemistry/molbiotech/maria_sunnerhagens_group/mtmdat/together with the manual and example files.

26148193,Basic Emotions in the Nencki Affective Word List (NAWL BE): New Method of Classifying Emotional Stimuli.,"The Nencki Affective Word List (NAWL) has recently been introduced as a standardized database of Polish words suitable for studying various aspects of language and emotions. Though the NAWL was originally based on the most commonly used dimensional approach, it is not the only way of studying emotions. Another framework is based on discrete emotional categories. Since the two perspectives are recognized as complementary, the aim of the present study was to supplement the NAWL database by the addition of categories corresponding to basic emotions. Thus, 2902 Polish words from the NAWL were presented to 265 subjects, who were instructed to rate them according to the intensity of each of the five basic emotions: happiness, anger, sadness, fear and disgust. The general characteristics of the present word database, as well as the relationships between the studied variables are shown to be consistent with typical patterns found in previous studies using similar databases for different languages. Here we present the Basic Emotions in the Nencki Affective Word List (NAWL BE) as a database of verbal material suitable for highly controlled experimental research. To make the NAWL more convenient to use, we introduce a comprehensive method of classifying stimuli to basic emotion categories. We discuss the advantages of our method in comparison to other methods of classification. Additionally, we provide an interactive online tool (http://exp.lobi.nencki.gov.pl/nawl-analysis) to help researchers browse and interactively generate classes of stimuli to meet their specific requirements.",1,

Together, the two resources provide a consistent set of programmatic and interactive interfaces to a rich range of data including genome sequence, gene models, transcript sequence, genetic variation, and comparative analysis. This paper provides an update to the previous publications about the resource, with a focus on recent developments and expansions. These include the incorporation of almost 20 000 additional genome sequences and over 35 000 tracks of RNA-Seq data, which have been aligned to genomic sequence and made available for visualization. Other advances since 2015 include the release of the database in Resource Description Framework (RDF) format, a large increase in community-derived curation, a new high-performance protein sequence search, additional cross-references, improved annotation of non-protein-coding genes, and the launch of pre-release and archival sites. Collectively, these changes are part of a continuing response to the increasing quantity of publicly-available genome-scale data, and the consequent need to archive, integrate, annotate and disseminate these using automated, scalable methods.",1,
27296980,Unbiased probabilistic taxonomic classification for DNA barcoding.,"<h4>Motivation</h4>When targeted to a barcoding region, high-throughput sequencing can be used to identify species or operational taxonomical units from environmental samples, and thus to study the diversity and structure of species communities. Although there are many methods which provide confidence scores for assigning taxonomic affiliations, it is not straightforward to translate these values to unbiased probabilities. We present a probabilistic method for taxonomical classification (PROTAX) of DNA sequences. Given a pre-defined taxonomical tree structure that is partially populated by reference sequences, PROTAX decomposes the probability of one to the set of all possible outcomes. PROTAX accounts for species that are present in the taxonomy but that do not have reference sequences, the possibility of unknown taxonomical units, as well as mislabeled reference sequences. PROTAX is based on a statistical multinomial regression model, and it can utilize any kind of sequence similarity measures or the outputs of other classifiers as predictors.<h4>Results</h4>We demonstrate the performance of PROTAX by using as predictors the output from BLAST, the phylogenetic classification software TIPP, and the RDP classifier. We show that PROTAX improves the predictions of the baseline implementations of TIPP and RDP classifiers, and that it is able to combine complementary information provided by BLAST and TIPP, resulting in accurate and unbiased classifications even with very challenging cases such as 50% mislabeling of reference sequences.<h4>Availability and implementation</h4>Perl/R implementation of PROTAX is available at http://www.helsinki.fi/science/metapop/Software.htm<h4>Contact</h4>panu.somervuo@helsinki.fi<h4>Supplementary information</h4>Supplementary data are available at Bioinformatics online.",0,
27430689,[Association between polymorphism in Vav3 genes and risk of primary prostatic cancer in Chinese Han population].,"<h4>Objective</h4>To study the associations between genetic variations of Vav3 gene and prostate cancer susceptibility.<h4>Methods</h4>Data were collected in a hospital-based and case-control study of 1 015 prostate cancer cases and 1 068 cancer-free controls collecting from a period of time between 2008 and 2012. Based on the online database, NCBI dbSNP (http: //www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/projects/SNP) and SNPinfo (http: //snpinfo.niehs.nih.gov/snpfunc.htm). Functional single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) of Vav3 were screened and genotyped, and assessed their associations with risk of prostate cancer by using logistic regression analysis. Furthermore, the associations between SNPs of Vav3 and some clinicopathological parameters were evaluated.<h4>Results</h4>Among the two SNPs investigated, only Vav3 rs12410676 G>A was associated with decreased prostate cancer risk [additive model, OR=0.80 (0.69-0.93), P=0.003; dominant model, OR=0.81 (0.68-0.97), P=0.022; recessive model, OR=0.54 (0.36-0.82), P=0.004]. The combined effect of Vav3 rs8676 G>A and rs12410676 G>A was found as a decreased prostate cancer risk along with the increased variant alleles (P<0.05). Specifically, participants carrying Vav3 rs12410676 AA/AG genotypes were more likely to be at lower prostate cancer risk, compared with participants carrying GG genotypes, in groups of BMI=25 kg/m(2,) smoking, Gleason>7(4+ 3), and higher invasive prostate cancer. Finally, some positive findings were evidently significant with false positive report probability values at different prior probability levels (0.25, 0.1 and 0.01).<h4>Conclusion</h4>Vav3 SNPs may contribute to the risk of prostate cancer in Eastern Chinese men, but the effect is weak and needs further validation by larger, multicenter and ethnic-based studies.",0,
30467523,gganatogram: An R package for modular visualisation of anatograms and tissues based on ggplot2.,"Displaying data onto anatomical structures is a convenient technique to quickly observe tissue related information. However, drawing tissues is a complex task that requires both expertise in anatomy and the arts. While web based applications exist for displaying gene expression on anatograms, other non-genetic disciplines lack similar tools. Moreover, web based tools often lack the modularity associated with packages in programming languages, such as R. Here I present gganatogram, an R package used to plot modular species anatograms based on a combination of the graphical grammar of ggplot2 and the publicly available anatograms from the Expression Atlas. This combination allows for quick and easy, modular, and reproducible generation of anatograms. Using only one command and a data frame with tissue name, group, colour, and †value, this tool enables the user to visualise specific human and mouse tissues with desired colours, grouped by a variable, or displaying a desired value, such as gene-expression, pharmacokinetics, or bacterial load across selected tissues. gganatogram consists of 5 highly annotated organisms, male/female human/mouse, and a cell anatogram. It further consists of 24 other less annotated organisms from the animal and plant kingdom. I hope that this tool will be useful by the wider community in biological sciences. Community members are welcome to submit additional anatograms, which can be incorporated into the package. A stable version gganatogram has been deposited to neuroconductor, and a development version can be found on† github/jespermaag/gganatogram. An interactive shiny app of gganatogram can be found on† https://jespermaag.shinyapps.io/gganatogram/, which allows for non-R users to create anatograms.",0,
30463894,Predicting Antimicrobial Resistance and Associated Genomic Features from Whole-Genome Sequencing.,"Thanks to the genomics revolution, thousands of strain-specific whole-genome sequences are now accessible for a wide range of pathogenic bacteria. This availability enables big data informatics approaches to be used to study the spread and acquisition of antimicrobial resistance (AMR). In this issue of the <i>Journal of Clinical Microbiology</i>, Nguyen et al. (M. Nguyen, S. W. Long, P. F. McDermott, R. J. Olsen, R. Olson, R. L. Stevens, G. H. Tyson, S. Zhao, and J. J. Davis, J Clin Microbiol 57:e01260-18, 2019, https://doi.org/10.1128/JCM.01260-18) report the results obtained with their machine learning models based on whole-genome sequencing data to predict the MICs of antibiotics for 5,728 nontyphoidal <i>Salmonella</i> genomes collected over 15 years in the United States. Their major finding demonstrates that MICs can be predicted with an average accuracy of 95% within ±1 2-fold dilution step (confidence interval, 95% to 95%), an average very major error rate of 2.7%, and an average major error rate of 0.1%. Importantly, these models predict MICs with no <i>a priori</i> information about the underlying gene content or resistance phenotypes of the strains, enabling the possibility to identify AMR determinants and rapidly diagnose and prioritize antibiotic use directly from the organism sequence. Employing such tools to diagnose and limit the spread of resistance-conferring mechanisms could help ameliorate the looming antibiotic resistance crisis.",0,
21828087,"OrganismTagger: detection, normalization and grounding of organism entities in biomedical documents.","<h4>Motivation</h4>Semantic tagging of organism mentions in full-text articles is an important part of literature mining and semantic enrichment solutions. Tagged organism mentions also play a pivotal role in disambiguating other entities in a text, such as proteins. A high-precision organism tagging system must be able to detect the numerous forms of organism mentions, including common names as well as the traditional taxonomic groups: genus, species and strains. In addition, such a system must resolve abbreviations and acronyms, assign the scientific name and if possible link the detected mention to the NCBI Taxonomy database for further semantic queries and literature navigation.<h4>Results</h4>We present the OrganismTagger, a hybrid rule-based/machine learning system to extract organism mentions from the literature. It includes tools for automatically generating lexical and ontological resources from a copy of the NCBI Taxonomy database, thereby facilitating system updates by end users. Its novel ontology-based resources can also be reused in other semantic mining and linked data tasks. Each detected organism mention is normalized to a canonical name through the resolution of acronyms and abbreviations and subsequently grounded with an NCBI Taxonomy database ID. In particular, our system combines a novel machine-learning approach with rule-based and lexical methods for detecting strain mentions in documents. On our manually annotated OT corpus, the OrganismTagger achieves a precision of 95%, a recall of 94% and a grounding accuracy of 97.5%. On the manually annotated corpus of Linnaeus-100, the results show a precision of 99%, recall of 97% and grounding accuracy of 97.4%.<h4>Availability</h4>The OrganismTagger, including supporting tools, resources, training data and manual annotations, as well as end user and developer documentation, is freely available under an open-source license at http://www.semanticsoftware.info/organism-tagger.<h4>Contact</h4>witte@semanticsoftware.info.",0,
33058887,How the CORAL software can be used to select compounds for efficient treatment of neurodegenerative diseases?,"Recommendations on the efficient application of CORAL software (http://www.insilico.eu/coral) to establish quantitative structure-property/activity relationships (QSPRs/QSARs) are provided. The predictive potential of the approach has been demonstrated for QSAR models developed for inhibitor concentrations (negative decimal logarithm of IC50) of derivatives of N-methyl-d-aspartate (NMDA) receptor, leucine-rich repeat kinase 2 (LRRK2), and tropomyosin receptor kinase A (TrkA). The above three protein targets are related to various neurodegenerative diseases such as Alzheimer's and Parkinson's. Each model was checked using several splits of the data for the training and the validation sets. The index of ideality of correlation (IIC) represents a tool to improve the predictive potential for an arbitrary model. However, the use of the IIC should be carried out according to rules, described in this work.",0,
22672254,The gastrointestinal electrical mapping suite (GEMS): software for analyzing and visualizing high-resolution (multi-electrode) recordings in spatiotemporal detail.,"<h4>Background</h4>Gastrointestinal contractions are controlled by an underlying bioelectrical activity. High-resolution spatiotemporal electrical mapping has become an important advance for investigating gastrointestinal electrical behaviors in health and motility disorders. However, research progress has been constrained by the low efficiency of the data analysis tasks. This work introduces a new efficient software package: GEMS (Gastrointestinal Electrical Mapping Suite), for analyzing and visualizing high-resolution multi-electrode gastrointestinal mapping data in spatiotemporal detail.<h4>Results</h4>GEMS incorporates a number of new and previously validated automated analytical and visualization methods into a coherent framework coupled to an intuitive and user-friendly graphical user interface. GEMS is implemented using MATLABÆ, which combines sophisticated mathematical operations and GUI compatibility. Recorded slow wave data can be filtered via a range of inbuilt techniques, efficiently analyzed via automated event-detection and cycle clustering algorithms, and high quality isochronal activation maps, velocity field maps, amplitude maps, frequency (time interval) maps and data animations can be rapidly generated. Normal and dysrhythmic activities can be analyzed, including initiation and conduction abnormalities. The software is distributed free to academics via a community user website and forum (http://sites.google.com/site/gimappingsuite).<h4>Conclusions</h4>This software allows for the rapid analysis and generation of critical results from gastrointestinal high-resolution electrical mapping data, including quantitative analysis and graphical outputs for qualitative analysis. The software is designed to be used by non-experts in data and signal processing, and is intended to be used by clinical researchers as well as physiologists and bioengineers.

29530061,Stearoyl-CoA desaturase-1 promotes colorectal cancer metastasis in response to glucose by suppressing PTEN.,"BACKGROUND:Diabetic patients have a higher risk factor for colorectal cancer (CRC) metastasis. Stearoyl-CoA desaturase 1 (SCD1), the main enzyme responsible for producing monounsaturated fatty acids(MUFA) from saturated fatty acids, is frequently deregulated in both diabetes and CRC. The function and mechanism of SCD1 in metastasis of CRC and its relevance to glucose remains largely unknown. METHODS:SCD1 expression levels were analyzed in human CRC tissues and the Cancer Browser database ( https://genome-cancer.ucsc.edu/ ). CRC cell lines stably transfected with SCD1 shRNAs or vector were established to investigate the role of SCD1 in modulating migration and invasion of CRC cells. A glucose concentration gradient was set to investigate regulation of SCD1 in CRC relevant to diabetic conditions. RESULTS:The clinical data analysis showed high expression of SCD1 in CRC tissues with a negative correlation with the prognosis of CRC. In vitro experiments revealed that SCD1 increased CRC progression through promoting epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT). Lipidomic analysis demonstrated that SCD1 increased MUFA levels and MUFA administration could rescue migration and invasion defect of CRC cells induced by SCD1 knockdown. Furthermore, SCD1-mediated progression of CRC was promoted by carbohydrate response-element binding protein (ChREBP) in response to high glucose. Mechanistically, hyperglycemia-SCD1-MUFA induced CRC cell migration and invasion by regulating PTEN. CONCLUSIONS:Our findings show that SCD1 promotes metastasis of CRC cells through MUFA production and suppressing PTEN in response to glucose, which may be a novel mechanism for diabetes-induced CRC metastasis.",0,
33533177,Neuroblastoma: The basis for cure in limited-resource settings.,"<h4>Background</h4>Neuroblastoma (NB) contributes the most to the mortality of childhood malignancies worldwide. The disease spectrum is heterogenous and the management complex and costly, especially in advanced disease or disease with adverse biology. In low- and middle-income countries (LMICs) the majority of NB presents in advanced stages. Therefore, with limited resources and poor prognosis the treatment of NB is often not a priority. The aim of the study was to evaluate the research activities and perceptions of the management of NB that determine the research and treatment approaches in LMICs.<h4>Methods</h4>Data were sourced from https://www.clinicaltrials.gov/ identifying NB trials open to LMIC. Abstracts on NB research presented at the International Society for Paediatric Oncology (SIOP) Congresses between 2014 and 2020 were evaluated according to income status. An online survey evaluating medical views on NB in LMICs and the effect on the management was conducted. Descriptive analysis was done. Where appropriate categorical association between covariates was assessed using the Pearson chi-square (<U+03C7><sup>2</sup> ) test or Fishers exact test.<h4>Results</h4>There were 15/562 (2.7%) trials open to LMIC. Only six of 138 (4.3%) LMIC participated in NB trials. Of the 688 abstracts presented between 2014 and 2020 at the SIOP International Congress on NB as primary subject, 297 (42.7%) were from LMICs. Only two were from low-income countries (LICs). Sixty-one countries responded to the NB survey. Positive views towards NB management were present when treatment was based on a national protocol, the availability of trimodal or advanced treatment options were present, and when a balance of metastatic or local disease were treated.<h4>Conclusion</h4>Management of NB in LMICs should include increased advocacy and research as well as implementation of national management strategies.",0,

At present, most ChIP-seq analysis tools adopt the command line, which lacks user-friendly interfaces. Although some web services with graphical interfaces have been developed for ChIP-seq analysis, these sites cannot provide a comprehensive analysis of ChIP-seq from raw data to downstream analysis.<h4>Results</h4>In this study, we develop a web service for the whole process of ChIP-Seq Analysis (CSA), which covers mapping, quality control, peak calling, and downstream analysis. In addition, CSA provides a customization function for users to define their own workflows. And the visualization of mapping, peak calling, motif finding, and pathway analysis results are also provided in CSA. For the different types of ChIP-seq datasets, CSA can provide the corresponding tool to perform the analysis. Moreover, CSA can detect differences in ChIP signals between ChIP samples and controls to identify absolute binding sites.<h4>Conclusions</h4>The two case studies demonstrate the effectiveness of CSA, which can complete the whole procedure of ChIP-seq analysis. CSA provides a web interface for users, and implements the visualization of every analysis step. The website of CSA is available at http://CompuBio.csu.edu.cn.",0,
23375235,Learning the local Bayesian network structure around the ZNF217 oncogene in breast tumours.,"In this study, we discuss and apply a novel and efficient algorithm for learning a local Bayesian network model in the vicinity of the ZNF217 oncogene from breast cancer microarray data without having to decide in advance which genes have to be included in the learning process. ZNF217 is a candidate oncogene located at 20q13, a chromosomal region frequently amplified in breast and ovarian cancer, and correlated with shorter patient survival in these cancers. To properly address the difficulties in managing complex gene interactions given our limited sample, statistical significance of edge strengths was evaluated using bootstrapping and the less reliable edges were pruned to increase the network robustness. We found that 13 out of the 35 genes associated with deregulated ZNF217 expression in breast tumours have been previously associated with survival and/or prognosis in cancers. Identifying genes involved in lipid metabolism opens new fields of investigation to decipher the molecular mechanisms driven by the ZNF217 oncogene. Moreover, nine of the 13 genes have already been identified as putative ZNF217 targets by independent biological studies. We therefore suggest that the algorithms for inferring local BNs are valuable data mining tools for unraveling complex mechanisms of biological pathways from expression data.

23419168,CD44/CD24 immunophenotypes on clinicopathologic features of salivary glands malignant neoplasms.,"<h4>Background</h4>Salivary glands malignant neoplasms (SGMNs) account for 3-6% of head and neck cancers and 0.3% of all cancers. Tumor cells that express CD44 and CD24 exhibit a stem-cell-like behavior. CD44 is the binding site for hyaluronic acid, and CD24 is a receptor that interacts with P-selectin to induce metastasis and tumor progression. The present study aims to evaluate the expression of CD44 and CD24 on SGMNs and correlated these data with several clinicopathologic features.<h4>Methods</h4>Immunohistochemical stains for CD44 and CD24 were performed on tissue microarrays containing SGMN samples from 69 patients. The CD44, CD24 and CD44/CD24 expression phenotypes were correlated to patient clinicopathologic features and outcome.<h4>Results</h4>CD44 expression was associated with the primary site of neoplasm (p = 0.046). CD24 was associated with clinical stage III/IV (p = 0.008), T stage (p = 0,27) and lymph node (p = 0,001). The CD44/CD24 profiles were associated with the primary site of injury (p = 0.005), lymph node (p = 0.011) and T stage (p = 0.023). Univariate analysis showed a significant relationship between clinical staging and disease- free survival (p = 0.009), and the overall survival presents relation with male gender (p = 0.011) and metastasis (p = 0.027).<h4>Conclusion</h4>In summary, our investigation confirms that the clinical stage, in accordance with the literature, is the main prognostic factor for SGMN. Additionally, we have presented some evidence that the analysis of isolated CD44 and CD24 immunoexpression or the two combined markers could give prognostic information associated to clinicopathologic features in SGMN.<h4>Virtual slides</h4>The virtual slide(s) for this article can be found here: http://www.diagnosticpathology.diagnomx.eu/vs/1284611098470676.",0,

Main outcomes were 1) linear growth from 6 to 12 mo of age; 2) hemoglobin, hematocrit, iron [serum ferritin (SF)], and zinc status at 12 mo of age; and 3) meat intake at 12 mo of age (by using a food-frequency questionnaire).<h4>Results</h4>A total of 38 infants/group provided data at 12 mo of age. NGG infants had significantly higher red meat intake [mean ± SD: 5.4 ± 1.8 compared with 3.5 ± 1.7 d/wk at 12 mo of age; P < 0.001), higher hemoglobin and hematocrit at 12 mo of age, and a significantly greater increase in hemoglobin (mean ± SD change: 0.41 ± 0.8 compared with -0.13 ± 1.0; P = 0.01) and hematocrit (1.04 ± 2.2 compared with -0.15 ± 2.4; P = 0.03) from 6 to 12 mo of age than those in CG infants. There were no significant differences in linear growth from 6 to 12 mo of age or in SF or zinc.<h4>Conclusions</h4>The new guidelines showed efficacy with higher red meat intake and positive effects on hemoglobin and hematocrit. The intervention was acceptable and affordable for most mothers. These preliminary results suggest that the intervention merits investigation in a larger cohort with longer-term follow-up.

This article examines trends in midwife-attended births from 1989 to 2009.<h4>Methods</h4>The data in this report are based on records gathered as part of the US National Standard Certificate of Live Birth from a public use Web site, Vital Stats (http://www.cdc.gov/nchs/VitalStats.htm), that allows users to create and download specialized tables.<h4>Results</h4>Between 2007 and 2009, the proportion of all births attended by CNMs increased by 4% from 7.3% of all births to 7.6% and a total of 313,516. This represents a decline in total births attended by CNMs from 2008 but a higher proportion of all births because total US births dropped at a faster rate. The proportion of vaginal births attended by CNMs reached an all-time high of 11.4% in 2009. There were strong regional patterns to the distribution of CNM-attended births. Births attended by ""other midwives"" rose to 21,787 or 0.5% of all US births, and the total proportion of all births attended by midwives reached an all-time high of 8.1%. The race/ethnicity of mothers attended by CNMs has shifted over the years. In 1990, CNMs attended a disproportionately high number of births to non-white mothers, whereas in 2009, the profile of CNM births mirrors the national distribution in race/ethnicity.<h4>Discussion</h4>Midwife-attended births in the United States are increasing. The geographic patterns in the distribution of midwife-attended births warrant further study.",0,
25286919,Computing autocatalytic sets to unravel inconsistencies in metabolic network reconstructions.,"<h4>Motivation</h4>Genome-scale metabolic network reconstructions have been established as a powerful tool for the prediction of cellular phenotypes and metabolic capabilities of organisms. In recent years, the number of network reconstructions has been constantly increasing, mostly because of the availability of novel (semi-)automated procedures, which enabled the reconstruction of metabolic models based on individual genomes and their annotation. The resulting models are widely used in numerous applications. However, the accuracy and predictive power of network reconstructions are commonly limited by inherent inconsistencies and gaps.<h4>Results</h4>Here we present a novel method to validate metabolic network reconstructions based on the concept of autocatalytic sets. Autocatalytic sets correspond to collections of metabolites that, besides enzymes and a growth medium, are required to produce all biomass components in a metabolic model. These autocatalytic sets are well-conserved across all domains of life, and their identification in specific genome-scale reconstructions allows us to draw conclusions about potential inconsistencies in these models. The method is capable of detecting inconsistencies, which are neglected by other gap-finding methods. We tested our method on the Model SEED, which is the largest repository for automatically generated genome-scale network reconstructions. In this way, we were able to identify a significant number of missing pathways in several of these reconstructions. Hence, the method we report represents a powerful tool to identify inconsistencies in large-scale metabolic networks.<h4>Availability and implementation</h4>The method is available as source code on http://users.minet.uni-jena.de/~m3kach/ASBIG/ASBIG.zip.<h4>Contact</h4>christoph.kaleta@uni-jena.de<h4>Supplementary information</h4>Supplementary data are available at Bioinformatics online.",0,
25725090,SimSeq: a nonparametric approach to simulation of RNA-sequence datasets.,"<h4>Motivation</h4>RNA sequencing analysis methods are often derived by relying on hypothetical parametric models for read counts that are not likely to be precisely satisfied in practice. Methods are often tested by analyzing data that have been simulated according to the assumed model. This testing strategy can result in an overly optimistic view of the performance of an RNA-seq analysis method.<h4>Results</h4>We develop a data-based simulation algorithm for RNA-seq data. The vector of read counts simulated for a given experimental unit has a joint distribution that closely matches the distribution of a source RNA-seq dataset provided by the user. We conduct simulation experiments based on the negative binomial distribution and our proposed nonparametric simulation algorithm. We compare performance between the two simulation experiments over a small subset of statistical methods for RNA-seq analysis available in the literature. We use as a benchmark the ability of a method to control the false discovery rate. Not surprisingly, methods based on parametric modeling assumptions seem to perform better with respect to false discovery rate control when data are simulated from parametric models rather than using our more realistic nonparametric simulation strategy.<h4>Availability and implementation</h4>The nonparametric simulation algorithm developed in this article is implemented in the R package SimSeq, which is freely available under the GNU General Public License (version 2 or later) from the Comprehensive R Archive Network (http://cran.rproject.org/).<h4>Contact</h4>sgbenidt@gmail.com<h4>Supplementary information</h4>Supplementary data are available at Bioinformatics online.",0,
31730280,Temperature dependence of NMR chemical shifts: Tracking and statistical analysis.,"Isotropic chemical shifts measured by solution nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy offer extensive insights into protein structure and dynamics. Temperature dependences add a valuable dimension; notably, the temperature dependences of amide proton chemical shifts are valuable probes of hydrogen bonding, temperature-dependent loss of structure, and exchange between distinct protein conformations. Accordingly, their uses include structural analysis of both folded and disordered proteins, and determination of the effects of mutations, binding, or solution conditions on protein energetics. Fundamentally, these temperature dependences result from changes in the local magnetic environments of nuclei, but correlations with global thermodynamic parameters measured via calorimetric methods have been observed. Although the temperature dependences of amide proton and nitrogen chemical shifts are often well approximated by a linear model, deviations from linearity are also observed and may be interpreted as evidence of fast exchange between distinct conformational states. Here, we describe computational methods, accessible via the Shift-T web server, including an automated tracking algorithm that propagates initial (single temperature) <sup>1</sup> H<U+F8FF><sup>15</sup> N cross peak assignments to spectra collected over a range of temperatures. Amide proton and nitrogen temperature coefficients (slopes determined by fitting chemical shift vs. temperature data to a linear model) are subsequently calculated. Also included are methods for the detection of systematic, statistically significant deviation from linearity (curvature) in the temperature dependences of amide proton chemical shifts. The use and utility of these methods are illustrated by example, and the Shift-T web server is freely available at http://meieringlab.uwaterloo.ca/shiftt.",0,
26395772,APTANI: a computational tool to select aptamers through sequence-structure motif analysis of HT-SELEX data.,"<h4>Motivation</h4>Aptamers are synthetic nucleic acid molecules that can bind biological targets in virtue of both their sequence and three-dimensional structure. Aptamers are selected using SELEX, Systematic Evolution of Ligands by EXponential enrichment, a technique that exploits aptamer-target binding affinity. The SELEX procedure, coupled with high-throughput sequencing (HT-SELEX), creates billions of random sequences capable of binding different epitopes on specific targets. Since this technique produces enormous amounts of data, computational analysis represents a critical step to screen and select the most biologically relevant sequences.<h4>Results</h4>Here, we present APTANI, a computational tool to identify target-specific aptamers from HT-SELEX data and secondary structure information. APTANI builds on AptaMotif algorithm, originally implemented to analyze SELEX data; extends the applicability of AptaMotif to HT-SELEX data and introduces new functionalities, as the possibility to identify binding motifs, to cluster aptamer families or to compare output results from different HT-SELEX cycles. Tabular and graphical representations facilitate the downstream biological interpretation of results.<h4>Availability and implementation</h4>APTANI is available at http://aptani.unimore.it.<h4>Contact</h4>silvio.bicciato@unimore.it<h4>Supplementary information</h4>Supplementary data are available at Bioinformatics online.",0,
28066963,Phenotiki: an open software and hardware platform for affordable and easy image-based phenotyping of rosette-shaped plants.,"Phenotyping is important to understand plant biology, but current solutions are costly, not versatile or are difficult to deploy. To solve this problem, we present Phenotiki, an affordable system for plant phenotyping that, relying on off-the-shelf parts, provides an easy to install and maintain platform, offering an out-of-box experience for a well-established phenotyping need: imaging rosette-shaped plants. The accompanying software (with available source code) processes data originating from our device seamlessly and automatically. Our software relies on machine learning to devise robust algorithms, and includes an automated leaf count obtained from 2D images without the need of depth (3D). Our affordable device (~Ä200) can be deployed in growth chambers or greenhouse to acquire optical 2D images of approximately up to 60 adult Arabidopsis rosettes concurrently. Data from the device are processed remotely on a workstation or via a cloud application (based on CyVerse). In this paper, we present a proof-of-concept validation experiment on top-view images of 24 Arabidopsis plants in a combination of genotypes that has not been compared previously. Phenotypic analysis with respect to morphology, growth, color and leaf count has not been performed comprehensively before now. We confirm the findings of others on some of the extracted traits, showing that we can phenotype at reduced cost. We also perform extensive validations with external measurements and with higher fidelity equipment, and find no loss in statistical accuracy when we use the affordable setting that we propose. Device set-up instructions and analysis software are publicly available ( http://phenotiki.com).",0,

30989232,Long-term Clinical Effectiveness of Ustekinumab in Patients with Crohn's Disease Who Failed Biologic Therapies: A National Cohort Study.,"<h4>Background</h4>Ustekinumab [UST] was recently approved in Europe for the treatment of moderate to severe Crohn's disease [CD]. Long-term real-world data are currently scarce for CD patients previously exposed to several biologics.<h4>Methods</h4>This is an observational, national, retrospective multicentre study. Patients received intravenous UST ~6 mg/kg at baseline, with 90 mg subcutaneously thereafter every 8 weeks. Response and remission rates were assessed at Weeks 8, 16, and 52.<h4>Results</h4>Data from 152 patients were analysed. All patients were exposed to at least one anti-TNFa agent, with 69.7% were exposed to even two anti-TNFa and vedolizumab. After 1 year, 42.1% and 25.7% of patients had experienced clinical response and clinical remission, respectively, and 38.8% and 24.3% had achieved steroid-free clinical response and remission, respectively; 38.8% of patients discontinued therapy during the 12 months of follow-up. Colonic location was predictive of clinical response at 1 year, and low body mass index [BMI] at baseline was a negative predictor of clinical remission. Resolution of arthralgia was associated with clinical response over time. De novo arthralgia was reported by 17.9% of patients at Week 8 and 13.5% of patients at Week 52. No impact of UST on arthralgia was observed in patients with concomitant ankylosing spondylitis [n = 17]. Others adverse events were reported in 7.2% of patients.<h4>Conclusions</h4>This real-world cohort study confirms the effectiveness of UST in CD patients previously exposed to several biologics. Ustekinumab was well tolerated with respect to adverse events.<h4>Podcast</h4>This article has an associated podcast which can be accessed at https://academic.oup.com/ecco-jcc/pages/podcast.",0,
22280360,The EnzymeTracker: an open-source laboratory information management system for sample tracking.,"<h4>Background</h4>In many laboratories, researchers store experimental data on their own workstation using spreadsheets. However, this approach poses a number of problems, ranging from sharing issues to inefficient data-mining. Standard spreadsheets are also error-prone, as data do not undergo any validation process. To overcome spreadsheets inherent limitations, a number of proprietary systems have been developed, which laboratories need to pay expensive license fees for. Those costs are usually prohibitive for most laboratories and prevent scientists from benefiting from more sophisticated data management systems.<h4>Results</h4>In this paper, we propose the EnzymeTracker, a web-based laboratory information management system for sample tracking, as an open-source and flexible alternative that aims at facilitating entry, mining and sharing of experimental biological data. The EnzymeTracker features online spreadsheets and tools for monitoring numerous experiments conducted by several collaborators to identify and characterize samples. It also provides libraries of shared data such as protocols, and administration tools for data access control using OpenID and user/team management. Our system relies on a database management system for efficient data indexing and management and a user-friendly AJAX interface that can be accessed over the Internet. The EnzymeTracker facilitates data entry by dynamically suggesting entries and providing smart data-mining tools to effectively retrieve data. Our system features a number of tools to visualize and annotate experimental data, and export highly customizable reports. It also supports QR matrix barcoding to facilitate sample tracking.<h4>Conclusions</h4>The EnzymeTracker was designed to be easy to use and offers many benefits over spreadsheets, thus presenting the characteristics required to facilitate acceptance by the scientific community. It has been successfully used for 20 months on a daily basis by over 50 scientists. The EnzymeTracker is freely available online at http://cubique.fungalgenomics.ca/enzymedb/index.html under the GNU GPLv3 license.",0,
30687361,PolyMorphPredict: A Universal Web-Tool for Rapid Polymorphic Microsatellite Marker Discovery From Whole Genome and Transcriptome Data.,"Microsatellites are ubiquitously distributed, polymorphic repeat sequence valuable for association, selection, population structure and identification. They can be mined by genomic library, probe hybridization and sequencing of selected clones. Such approach has many limitations like biased hybridization and selection of larger repeats. In silico mining of polymorphic markers using data of various genotypes can be rapid and economical. Available tools lack in some or other aspects like: targeted user defined primer generation, polymorphism discovery using multiple sequence, size and number limits of input sequence, no option for primer generation and e-PCR evaluation, transferability, lack of complete automation and user-friendliness. They also lack the provision to evaluate published primers in e-PCR mode to generate additional allelic data using re-sequenced data of various genotypes for judicious utilization of previously generated data. We developed the tool (PolyMorphPredict) using Perl, R, Java and launched at Apache which is available at http://webtom.cabgrid.res.in/polypred/. It mines microsatellite loci and computes primers from genome/transcriptome data of any species. It can perform e-PCR using published primers for polymorphism discovery and across species transferability of microsatellite loci. Present tool has been evaluated using five species of different genome size having 21 genotypes. Though server is equipped with genomic data of three species for test run with gel simulation, but can be used for any species. Further, polymorphism predictability has been validated using in silico and in vitro PCR of four rice genotypes. This tool can accelerate the in silico microsatellite polymorphism discovery in re-sequencing projects of any species of plant and animal for their diversity estimation along with variety/breed identification, population structure, MAS, QTL and gene discovery, traceability, parentage testing, fungal diagnostics and genome finishing.",0,
23685432,DRIMust: a web server for discovering rank imbalanced motifs using suffix trees.,"Cellular regulation mechanisms that involve proteins and other active molecules interacting with specific targets often involve the recognition of sequence patterns. Short sequence elements on DNA, RNA and proteins play a central role in mediating such molecular recognition events. Studies that focus on measuring and investigating sequence-based recognition processes make use of statistical and computational tools that support the identification and understanding of sequence motifs. We present a new web application, named DRIMust, freely accessible through the website http://drimust.technion.ac.il for de novo motif discovery services. The DRIMust algorithm is based on the minimum hypergeometric statistical framework and uses suffix trees for an efficient enumeration of motif candidates. DRIMust takes as input ranked lists of sequences in FASTA format and returns motifs that are over-represented at the top of the list, where the determination of the threshold that defines top is data driven. The resulting motifs are presented individually with an accurate P-value indication and as a Position Specific Scoring Matrix. Comparing DRIMust with other state-of-the-art tools demonstrated significant advantage to DRIMust, both in result accuracy and in short running times. Overall, DRIMust is unique in combining efficient search on large ranked lists with rigorous P-value assessment for the detected motifs.",0,
26691201,An ultra-high-density map as a community resource for discerning the genetic basis of quantitative traits in maize.,"<h4>Background</h4>To safeguard the food supply for the growing human population, it is important to understand and exploit the genetic basis of quantitative traits. Next-generation sequencing technology performs advantageously and effectively in genetic mapping and genome analysis of diverse genetic resources. Hence, we combined re-sequencing technology and a bin map strategy to construct an ultra-high-density bin map with thousands of bin markers to precisely map a quantitative trait locus.<h4>Results</h4>In this study, we generated a linkage map containing 1,151,856 high quality SNPs between Mo17 and B73, which were verified in the maize intermated B73 ◊ Mo17 (IBM) Syn10 population. This resource is an excellent complement to existing maize genetic maps available in an online database† (iPlant, http://data.maizecode.org/maize/qtl/syn10/ ). Moreover, in this population combined with the IBM Syn4 RIL population, we detected 135 QTLs for flowering time and plant height traits across the two populations. Eighteen known functional genes and twenty-five candidate genes for flowering time and plant height trait were fine-mapped into a 2.21-4.96†Mb interval. Map expansion and segregation distortion were also analyzed, and evidence for inadvertent selection of early flowering time in the process of mapping population development was observed. Furthermore, an updated integrated map with 1,151,856 high-quality SNPs, 2,916 traditional markers and 6,618 bin markers was constructed. The data were deposited into the iPlant Discovery Environment (DE), which provides a fundamental resource of genetic data for the maize genetic research community.<h4>Conclusions</h4>Our findings provide basic essential genetic data for the maize genetic research community. An updated IBM Syn10 population and a reliable, verified high-quality SNP set between Mo17 and B73 will aid in future molecular breeding efforts.",0,
28035026,InMoDe: tools for learning and visualizing intra-motif dependencies of DNA binding sites.,"<h4>Summary</h4>Recent studies have shown that the traditional position weight matrix model is often insufficient for modeling transcription factor binding sites, as intra-motif dependencies play a significant role for an accurate description of binding motifs. Here, we present the Java application InMoDe, a collection of tools for learning, leveraging and visualizing such dependencies of putative higher order. The distinguishing feature of InMoDe is a robust model selection from a class of parsimonious models, taking into account dependencies only if justified by the data while choosing for simplicity otherwise.<h4>Availability and implementation</h4>InMoDe is implemented in Java and is available as command line application, as application with a graphical user-interface, and as an integration into Galaxy on the project website at http://www.jstacs.de/index.php/InMoDe .<h4>Contact</h4>ralf.eggeling@cs.helsinki.fi.",0,
31296218,Evaluating single-subject study methods for personal transcriptomic interpretations to advance precision medicine.,"<h4>Background</h4>Gene expression profiling has benefited medicine by providing clinically relevant insights at the molecular candidate and systems levels. However, to adopt a more 'precision' approach that integrates individual variability including 'omics data into risk assessments, diagnoses, and therapeutic decision making, whole transcriptome expression needs to be interpreted meaningfully for single subjects. We propose an ""all-against-one"" framework that uses biological replicates in isogenic conditions for testing differentially expressed genes (DEGs) in a single subject (ss) in the absence of an appropriate external reference standard or replicates. To evaluate our proposed ""all-against-one"" framework, we construct reference standards (RSs) with five conventional replicate-anchored analyses (NOISeq, DEGseq, edgeR, DESeq, DESeq2) and the remainder were treated separately as single-subject sample pairs for ss analyses (without replicates).<h4>Results</h4>Eight ss methods (NOISeq, DEGseq, edgeR, mixture model, DESeq, DESeq2, iDEG, and ensemble) for identifying genes with differential expression were compared in Yeast (parental line versus snf2 deletion mutant; n†= 42/condition) and a MCF7 breast-cancer cell line (baseline versus stimulated with estradiol; n†= 7/condition). Receiver-operator characteristic (ROC) and precision-recall plots were determined for eight ss methods against each of the five RSs in both datasets. Consistent with prior analyses of these data, ~ 50% and ~ 15% DEGs were obtained in Yeast and MCF7 datasets respectively, regardless of the RSs method. NOISeq, edgeR, and DESeq were the most concordant for creating a RS. Single-subject versions of NOISeq, DEGseq, and an ensemble learner achieved the best median ROC-area-under-the-curve to compare two transcriptomes without replicates regardless of the RS method and dataset (> 90% in Yeast, > 0.75 in MCF7). Further, distinct specific single-subject methods perform better according to different proportions of DEGs.<h4>Conclusions</h4>The ""all-against-one"" framework provides a honest evaluation framework for single-subject DEG studies since these methods are evaluated, by design, against reference standards produced by unrelated DEG methods. The ss-ensemble method was the only one to reliably produce higher accuracies in all conditions tested in this conservative evaluation framework. However, single-subject methods for identifying DEGs from paired samples need improvement, as no method performed with precision> 90% and obtained moderate levels of recall. http://www.lussiergroup.org/publications/EnsembleBiomarker.",0,
28426817,Evaluation of machine learning algorithms and structural features for optimal MRI-based diagnostic prediction in psychosis.,"A relatively large number of studies have investigated the power of structural magnetic resonance imaging (sMRI) data to discriminate patients with schizophrenia from healthy controls. However, very few of them have also included patients with bipolar disorder, allowing the clinically relevant discrimination between both psychotic diagnostics. To assess the efficacy of sMRI data for diagnostic prediction in psychosis we objectively evaluated the discriminative power of a wide range of commonly used machine learning algorithms (ridge, lasso, elastic net and L0 norm regularized logistic regressions, a support vector classifier, regularized discriminant analysis, random forests and a Gaussian process classifier) on main sMRI features including grey and white matter voxel-based morphometry (VBM), vertex-based cortical thickness and volume, region of interest volumetric measures and wavelet-based morphometry (WBM) maps. All possible combinations of algorithms and data features were considered in pairwise classifications of matched samples of healthy controls (N = 127), patients with schizophrenia (N = 128) and patients with bipolar disorder (N = 128). Results show that the selection of feature type is important, with grey matter VBM (without data reduction) delivering the best diagnostic prediction rates (averaging over classifiers: schizophrenia vs. healthy 75%, bipolar disorder vs. healthy 63% and schizophrenia vs. bipolar disorder 62%) whereas algorithms usually yielded very similar results. Indeed, those grey matter VBM accuracy rates were not even improved by combining all feature types in a single prediction model. Further multi-class classifications considering the three groups simultaneously made evident a lack of predictive power for the bipolar group, probably due to its intermediate anatomical features, located between those observed in healthy controls and those found in patients with schizophrenia. Finally, we provide MRIPredict (https://www.nitrc.org/projects/mripredict/), a free tool for SPM, FSL and R, to easily carry out voxelwise predictions based on VBM images.",0,
30701134,"Prognostic values of GMPS, PR, CD40, and p21 in ovarian cancer.","Early detection and prediction of prognosis and treatment responses are all the keys in improving survival of ovarian cancer patients. This study profiled an ovarian cancer progression model to identify prognostic biomarkers for ovarian cancer patients. Mouse ovarian surface epithelial cells (MOSECs) can undergo spontaneous malignant transformation in vitro cell culture. These were used as a model of ovarian cancer progression for alterations in gene expression and signaling detected using the Illumina HiSeq2000 Next-Generation Sequencing platform and bioinformatical analyses. The differential expression of four selected genes was identified using the gene expression profiling interaction analysis (http://gepia.cancer-pku.cn/) and then associated with survival in ovarian cancer patients using the Cancer Genome Atlas dataset and the online Kaplan-Meier Plotter (http://www.kmplot.com) data. The data showed 263 aberrantly expressed genes, including 182 up-regulated and 81 down-regulated genes between the early and late stages of tumor progression in MOSECs. The bioinformatic data revealed four genes (i.e., guanosine 5'-monophosphate synthase (GMPS), progesterone receptor (PR), CD40, and p21 (cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor 1A)) to play an important role in ovarian cancer progression. Furthermore, the Cancer Genome Atlas dataset validated the differential expression of these four genes, which were associated with prognosis in ovarian cancer patients. In conclusion, this study profiled differentially expressed genes using the ovarian cancer progression model and identified four (i.e., GMPS, PR, CD40, and p21) as prognostic markers for ovarian cancer patients. Future studies of prospective patients could further verify the clinical usefulness of this four-gene signature.",0,
24185698,LSD 2.0: an update of the leaf senescence database.,"This manuscript describes an update of the leaf senescence database (LSD) previously featured in the 2011 NAR Database Issue. LSD provides comprehensive information concerning senescence-associated genes (SAGs) and their corresponding mutants. We have made extensive annotations for these SAGs through both manual and computational approaches. Recently, we updated LSD to a new version LSD 2.0 (http://www.eplantsenescence.org/), which contains 5356 genes and 322 mutants from 44 species, an extension from the previous version containing 1145 genes and 154 mutants from 21 species. In the current version, we also included several new features: (i) Primer sequences retrieved based on experimental evidence or designed for high-throughput analysis were added; (ii) More than 100 images of Arabidopsis SAG mutants were added; (iii) Arabidopsis seed information obtained from The Arabidopsis Information Resource (TAIR) was integrated; (iv) Subcellular localization information of SAGs in Arabidopsis mined from literature or generated from the SUBA3 program was presented; (v) Quantitative Trait Loci information was added with links to the original database and (vi) New options such as primer and miRNA search for database query were implemented.

26515641,Mouse polyQ database: a new online resource for research using mouse models of neurodegenerative diseases.,"<h4>Background</h4>The polyglutamine (polyQ) family of disorders comprises 9 genetic diseases, including several types of ataxia and Huntington disease. Approximately two decades of investigation and the creation of more than 130 mouse models of polyQ disorders have revealed many similarities between these diseases. The disorders share common mutation types, neurological characteristics and certain aspects of pathogenesis, including morphological and physiological neuronal alterations. All of the diseases still remain incurable.<h4>Description</h4>The large volume of information collected as a result of the investigation of polyQ models currently represents a great potential for searching, comparing and translating pathogenesis and therapeutic information between diseases. Therefore, we generated a public database comprising the polyQ mouse models, phenotypes and therapeutic interventions tested in vivo. The database is available at http://conyza.man.poznan.pl/ .<h4>Conclusion</h4>The use of the database in the field of polyQ diseases may accelerate research on these and other neurodegenerative diseases and provide new perspectives for future investigation.",1,
33810805,Fast lightweight accurate xenograft sorting.,"<h4>Motivation</h4>With an increasing number of patient-derived xenograft (PDX) models being created and subsequently sequenced to study tumor heterogeneity and to guide therapy decisions, there is a similarly increasing need for methods to separate reads originating from the graft (human) tumor and reads originating from the host species' (mouse) surrounding tissue. Two kinds of methods are in use: On the one hand, alignment-based tools require that reads are mapped and aligned (by an external mapper/aligner) to the host and graft genomes separately first; the tool itself then processes the resulting alignments and quality metrics (typically BAM files) to assign each read or read pair. On the other hand, alignment-free tools work directly on the raw read data (typically FASTQ files). Recent studies compare different approaches and tools, with varying results.<h4>Results</h4>We show that alignment-free methods for xenograft sorting are superior concerning CPU time usage and equivalent in accuracy. We improve upon the state of the art sorting by presenting a fast lightweight approach based on three-way bucketed quotiented Cuckoo hashing. Our hash table requires memory comparable to an FM index typically used for read alignment and less than other alignment-free approaches. It allows extremely fast lookups and uses less CPU time than other alignment-free methods and alignment-based methods at similar accuracy. Several engineering steps (e.g., shortcuts for unsuccessful lookups, software prefetching) improve the performance even further.<h4>Availability</h4>Our software xengsort is available under the MIT license at http://gitlab.com/genomeinformatics/xengsort . It is written in numba-compiled Python and comes with sample Snakemake workflows for hash table construction and dataset processing.",0,
29743730,Evaluating soil moisture retrievals from ESA's SMOS and NASA's SMAP brightness temperature datasets.,"Two satellites are currently monitoring surface soil moisture (SM) using L-band observations: SMOS (Soil Moisture and Ocean Salinity), a joint ESA (European Space Agency), CNES (Centre national d'Ètudes spatiales), and CDTI (the Spanish government agency with responsibility for space) satellite launched on November 2, 2009 and SMAP (Soil Moisture Active Passive), a National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) satellite successfully launched in January 2015. In this study, we used a multilinear regression approach to retrieve SM from SMAP data to create a global dataset of SM, which is consistent with SM data retrieved from SMOS. This was achieved by calibrating coefficients of the regression model using the CATDS (Centre Aval de Traitement des DonnÈes) SMOS Level 3 SM and the horizontally and vertically polarized brightness temperatures (TB) at 40∞ incidence angle, over the 2013 - 2014 period. Next, this model was applied to SMAP L3 TB data from Apr 2015 to Jul 2016. The retrieved SM from SMAP (referred to here as SMAP_Reg) was compared to: (i) the operational SMAP L3 SM (SMAP_SCA), retrieved using the baseline Single Channel retrieval Algorithm (SCA); and (ii) the operational SMOSL3 SM, derived from the multiangular inversion of the L-MEB model (L-MEB algorithm) (SMOSL3). This inter-comparison was made against <i>in situ</i> soil moisture measurements from more than 400 sites spread over the globe, which are used here as a reference soil moisture dataset. The <i>in situ</i> observations were obtained from the International Soil Moisture Network (ISMN; https://ismn.geo.tuwien.ac.at/) in North of America (PBO_H2O, SCAN, SNOTEL, iRON, and USCRN), in Australia (Oznet), Africa (DAHRA), and in Europe (REMEDHUS, SMOSMANIA, FMI, and RSMN). The agreement was analyzed in terms of four classical statistical criteria: Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE), Bias, Unbiased RMSE (UnbRMSE), and correlation coefficient (R). Results of the comparison of these various products with <i>in situ</i> observations show that the performance of both SMAP products i.e. SMAP_SCA and SMAP_Reg is similar and marginally better to that of the SMOSL3 product particularly over the PBO_H2O, SCAN, and USCRN sites. However, SMOSL3 SM was closer to the <i>in situ</i> observations over the DAHRA and Oznet sites. We found that the correlation between all three datasets and <i>in situ</i> measurements is best (R > 0.80) over the Oznet sites and worst (R = 0.58) over the SNOTEL sites for SMAP_SCA and over the DAHRA and SMOSMANIA sites (R= 0.51 and R= 0.45 for SMAP_Reg and SMOSL3, respectively). The Bias values showed that all products are generally dry, except over RSMN, DAHRA, and Oznet (and FMI for SMAP_SCA). Finally, our analysis provided interesting insights that can be useful to improve the consistency between SMAP and SMOS datasets.",0,
25267795,CarrotDB: a genomic and transcriptomic database for carrot.,"Carrot (Daucus carota L.) is an economically important vegetable worldwide and is the largest source of carotenoids and provitamin A in the human diet. Given the importance of this vegetable to humans, research and breeding communities on carrot should obtain useful genomic and transcriptomic information. The first whole-genome sequences of 'DC-27' carrot were de novo assembled and analyzed. Transcriptomic sequences of 14 carrot genotypes were downloaded from the Sequence Read Archive (SRA) database of National Center for Biotechnology Information (NCBI) and mapped to the whole-genome sequence before assembly. Based on these data sets, the first Web-based genomic and transcriptomic database for D. carota (CarrotDB) was developed (database homepage: http://apiaceae.njau.edu.cn/car†rotdb). CarrotDB offers the tools of Genome Map and Basic Local Alignment Search Tool. Using these tools, users can search certain target genes and simple sequence repeats along with designed primers of 'DC-27'. Assembled transcriptomic sequences along with fragments per kilobase of transcript sequence per millions base pairs sequenced information (FPKM) information of 14 carrot genotypes are also provided. Users can download de novo assembled whole-genome sequences, putative gene sequences and putative protein sequences of 'DC-27'. Users can also download transcriptome sequence assemblies of 14 carrot genotypes along with their FPKM information. A total of 2826 transcription factor (TF) genes classified into 57 families were identified in the entire genome sequences. These TF genes were embedded in CarrotDB as an interface. The 'GERMPLASM' part of CarrotDB also offers taproot photos of 45 carrot genotypes and a table containing accession numbers, names, countries of origin and colors of cortex, phloem and xylem parts of taproots corresponding to each carrot genotype. CarrotDB will be continuously updated with new information. Database URL: http://apiaceae.njau.edu.cn/carrotdb/",1,
31664080,dendPoint: a web resource for dendrimer pharmacokinetics investigation and prediction.,"Nanomedicine development currently suffers from a lack of efficient tools to predict pharmacokinetic behavior without relying upon testing in large numbers of animals, impacting success rates and development costs. This work presents dendPoint, the first in silico model to predict the intravenous pharmacokinetics of dendrimers, a commonly explored drug vector, based on physicochemical properties. We have manually curated the largest relational database of dendrimer pharmacokinetic parameters and their structural/physicochemical properties. This was used to develop a machine learning-based model capable of accurately predicting pharmacokinetic parameters, including half-life, clearance, volume of distribution and dose recovered in the liver and urine. dendPoint successfully predicts dendrimer pharmacokinetic properties, achieving correlations of up to r = 0.83 and Q<sup>2</sup> up to 0.68. dendPoint is freely available as a user-friendly web-service and database at http://biosig.unimelb.edu.au/dendpoint . This platform is ultimately expected to be used to guide dendrimer construct design and refinement prior to embarking on more time consuming and expensive in vivo testing.",1,
28748223,PhenoPlasm: a database of disruption phenotypes for malaria parasite genes.,"Two decades after the first <i>Plasmodium</i> transfection, attempts have been made to disrupt more than 3,151 genes in malaria parasites, across five <i>Plasmodium</i> species. While results from rodent malaria transfections have been curated and systematised, empowering large-scale analysis, phenotypic data from human malaria parasite transfections currently exists as individual reports scattered across a the literature. To facilitate systematic analysis of published experimental genetic data across <i>Plasmodium</i> species, we have built PhenoPlasm ( http://www.phenoplasm.org), a database of phenotypes generated by transfection experiments in all <i>Plasmodium</i> parasites. The site provides a simple interface linking citation-backed <i>Plasmodium</i> reverse-genetic phenotypes to gene IDs. The database has been populated with phenotypic data on 367 <i>P. falciparum</i> genes, curated from 176 individual publications, as well as existing data on rodent <i>Plasmodium</i> species from RMgmDB and PlasmoGEM. This is the first time that all available data on <i>P. falciparum</i> transfection experiments has been brought together in a single place. These data are presented using ortholog mapping to allow a researcher interested in a gene in one species to see results across other <i>Plasmodium</i> species. The collaborative nature of the database enables any researcher to add new phenotypes as they are discovered. As an example of database utility, we use the currently available datasets to identify RAP (RNA-binding domain abundant in Apicomplexa)-domain containing proteins as crucial to parasite survival.",1,
30154154,TIP: A Web Server for Resolving Tumor Immunophenotype Profiling.,": Systematically tracking the tumor immunophenotype is required to understand the mechanisms of cancer immunity and improve clinical benefit of cancer immunotherapy. However, progress in current research is hindered by the lack of comprehensive immune activity resources and easy-to-use tools for biologists, clinicians, and researchers to conveniently evaluate immune activity during the ""cancer-immunity cycle."" We developed a user-friendly one-stop shop web tool called TIP to comprehensively resolve tumor immunophenotype. TIP has the capability to rapidly analyze and intuitively visualize the activity of anticancer immunity and the extent of tumor-infiltrating immune cells across the seven-step cancer-immunity cycle. Also, we precalculated the pan-cancer immunophenotype for 11,373 samples from 33 The Cancer Genome Atlas human cancers that allow users to obtain and compare immunophenotype of pan-cancer samples. We expect TIP to be useful in a large number of emerging cancer immunity studies and development of effective immunotherapy biomarkers. TIP is freely available for use at http://biocc.hrbmu.edu.cn/TIP/. SIGNIFICANCE: TIP is a one-stop shop platform that can help biologists, clinicians, and researchers conveniently evaluate anticancer immune activity with their own gene expression data.<i>See related commentary by Hirano, p. 6536</i>.",0,
21496265,SNP-based pathway enrichment analysis for genome-wide association studies.,"<h4>Background</h4>Recently we have witnessed a surge of interest in using genome-wide association studies (GWAS) to discover the genetic basis of complex diseases. Many genetic variations, mostly in the form of single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs), have been identified in a wide spectrum of diseases, including diabetes, cancer, and psychiatric diseases. A common theme arising from these studies is that the genetic variations discovered by GWAS can only explain a small fraction of the genetic risks associated with the complex diseases. New strategies and statistical approaches are needed to address this lack of explanation. One such approach is the pathway analysis, which considers the genetic variations underlying a biological pathway, rather than separately as in the traditional GWAS studies. A critical challenge in the pathway analysis is how to combine evidences of association over multiple SNPs within a gene and multiple genes within a pathway. Most current methods choose the most significant SNP from each gene as a representative, ignoring the joint action of multiple SNPs within a gene. This approach leads to preferential identification of genes with a greater number of SNPs.<h4>Results</h4>We describe a SNP-based pathway enrichment method for GWAS studies. The method consists of the following two main steps: 1) for a given pathway, using an adaptive truncated product statistic to identify all representative (potentially more than one) SNPs of each gene, calculating the average number of representative SNPs for the genes, then re-selecting the representative SNPs of genes in the pathway based on this number; and 2) ranking all selected SNPs by the significance of their statistical association with a trait of interest, and testing if the set of SNPs from a particular pathway is significantly enriched with high ranks using a weighted Kolmogorov-Smirnov test. We applied our method to two large genetically distinct GWAS data sets of schizophrenia, one from European-American (EA) and the other from African-American (AA). In the EA data set, we found 22 pathways with nominal P-value less than or equal to 0.001 and corresponding false discovery rate (FDR) less than 5%. In the AA data set, we found 11 pathways by controlling the same nominal P-value and FDR threshold. Interestingly, 8 of these pathways overlap with those found in the EA sample. We have implemented our method in a JAVA software package, called SNP Set Enrichment Analysis (SSEA), which contains a user-friendly interface and is freely available at http://cbcl.ics.uci.edu/SSEA.<h4>Conclusions</h4>The SNP-based pathway enrichment method described here offers a new alternative approach for analysing GWAS data. By applying it to schizophrenia GWAS studies, we show that our method is able to identify statistically significant pathways, and importantly, pathways that can be replicated in large genetically distinct samples.",0,
23281802,BM-Map: an efficient software package for accurately allocating multireads of RNA-sequencing data.,"<h4>Background</h4>RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) has become a major tool for biomedical research. A key step in analyzing RNA-seq data is to infer the origin of short reads in the source genome, and for this purpose, many read alignment/mapping software programs have been developed. Usually, the majority of mappable reads can be mapped to one unambiguous genomic location, and these reads are called unique reads. However, a considerable proportion of mappable reads can be aligned to more than one genomic location with the same or similar fidelities, and they are called ""multireads"". Allocating these multireads is challenging but critical for interpreting RNA-seq data. We recently developed a Bayesian stochastic model that allocates multireads more accurately than alternative methods (Ji et al. Biometrics 2011).<h4>Results</h4>In order to serve a greater biological community, we have implemented this method in a stand-alone, efficient, and user-friendly software package, BM-Map. BM-Map takes SAM (Sequence Alignment/Map), the most popular read alignment format, as the standard input; then based on the Bayesian model, it calculates mapping probabilities of multireads for competing genomic loci; and BM-Map generates the output by adding mapping probabilities to the original SAM file so that users can easily perform downstream analyses. The program is available in three common operating systems, Linux, Mac and PC. Moreover, we have built a dedicated website, http://bioinformatics.mdanderson.org/main/BM-Map, which includes free downloads, detailed tutorials and illustration examples.<h4>Conclusions</h4>We have developed a stand-alone, efficient, and user-friendly software package for accurately allocating multireads, which is an important addition to our previous methodology paper. We believe that this bioinformatics tool will greatly help RNA-seq and related applications reach their full potential in life science research.",0,
27187006,Targeting vascular (endothelial) dysfunction.,"Cardiovascular diseases are major contributors to global deaths and disability-adjusted life years, with hypertension a significant risk factor for all causes of death. The endothelium that lines the inner wall of the vasculature regulates essential haemostatic functions, such as vascular tone, circulation of blood cells, inflammation and platelet activity. Endothelial dysfunction is an early predictor of atherosclerosis and future cardiovascular events. We review the prognostic value of obtaining measurements of endothelial function, the clinical techniques for its determination, the mechanisms leading to endothelial dysfunction and the therapeutic treatment of endothelial dysfunction. Since vascular oxidative stress and inflammation are major determinants of endothelial function, we have also addressed current antioxidant and anti-inflammatory therapies. In the light of recent data that dispute the prognostic value of endothelial function in healthy human cohorts, we also discuss alternative diagnostic parameters such as vascular stiffness index and intima/media thickness ratio. We also suggest that assessing vascular function, including that of smooth muscle and even perivascular adipose tissue, may be an appropriate parameter for clinical investigations.<h4>Linked articles</h4>This article is part of a themed section on Redox Biology and Oxidative Stress in Health and Disease.

29757429,AlloFinder: a strategy for allosteric modulator discovery and allosterome analyses.,"Allostery tweaks innumerable biological processes and plays a fundamental role in human disease and drug discovery. Exploration of allostery has thus been regarded as a crucial requirement for research on biological mechanisms and the development of novel therapeutics. Here, based on our previously developed allosteric data and methods, we present an interactive platform called AlloFinder that identifies potential endogenous or exogenous allosteric modulators and their involvement in human allosterome. AlloFinder automatically amalgamates allosteric site identification, allosteric screening and allosteric scoring evaluation of modulator-protein complexes to identify allosteric modulators, followed by allosterome mapping analyses of predicted allosteric sites and modulators in human proteome. This web server exhibits prominent performance in the reemergence of allosteric metabolites and exogenous allosteric modulators in known allosteric proteins. Specifically, AlloFinder enables identification of allosteric metabolites for metabolic enzymes and screening of potential allosteric compounds for disease-related targets. Significantly, the feasibility of AlloFinder to discover allosteric modulators was tested in a real case of signal transduction and activation of transcription 3 (STAT3) and validated by mutagenesis and functional experiments. Collectively, AlloFinder is expected to contribute to exploration of the mechanisms of allosteric regulation between metabolites and metabolic enzymes, and to accelerate allosteric drug discovery.

31112088,Using Artificial Intelligence to Revise ACR TI-RADS Risk Stratification of Thyroid Nodules: Diagnostic Accuracy and Utility.,"Background Risk stratification systems for thyroid nodules are often complicated and affected by low specificity. Continual improvement of these systems is necessary to reduce the number of unnecessary thyroid biopsies. Purpose To use artificial intelligence (AI) to optimize the American College of Radiology (ACR) Thyroid Imaging Reporting and Data System (TI-RADS). Materials and Methods A total of 1425 biopsy-proven thyroid nodules from 1264 consecutive patients (1026 women; mean age, 52.9 years [range, 18-93 years]) were evaluated retrospectively. Expert readers assigned points based on five ACR TI-RADS categories (composition, echogenicity, shape, margin, echogenic foci), and a genetic AI algorithm was applied to a training set (1325 nodules). Point and pathologic data were used to create an optimized scoring system (hereafter, AI TI-RADS). Performance of the systems was compared by using a test set of the final 100 nodules with interpretations from the expert reader, eight nonexpert readers, and an expert panel. Initial performance of AI TI-RADS was calculated by using a test for differences between binomial proportions. Additional comparisons across readers were conducted by using bootstrapping; diagnostic performance was assessed by using area under the receiver operating curve. Results AI TI-RADS assigned new point values for eight ACR TI-RADS features. Six features were assigned zero points, which simplified categorization. By using expert reader data, the diagnostic performance of ACR TI-RADS and AI TI-RADS was area under the receiver operating curve of 0.91 and 0.93, respectively. For the same expert, specificity of AI TI-RADS (65%, 55 of 85) was higher (P < .001) than that of ACR TI-RADS (47%, 40 of 85). For the eight nonexpert radiologists, mean specificity for AI TI-RADS (55%) was also higher (P < .001) than that of ACR TI-RADS (48%). An interactive AI TI-RADS calculator can be viewed at http://deckard.duhs.duke.edu/~ai-ti-rads . Conclusion An artificial intelligence-optimized Thyroid Imaging Reporting and Data System (TI-RADS) validates the American College of Radiology TI-RADS while slightly improving specificity and maintaining sensitivity. Additionally, it simplifies feature assignments, which may improve ease of use. © RSNA, 2019 Online supplemental material is available for this article.",0,
27512621,Weighted K-means support vector machine for cancer prediction.,"To date, the support vector machine (SVM) has been widely applied to diverse bio-medical fields to address disease subtype identification and pathogenicity of genetic variants. In this paper, I propose the weighted K-means support vector machine (wKM-SVM) and weighted support vector machine (wSVM), for which I allow the SVM to impose weights to the loss term. Besides, I demonstrate the numerical relations between the objective function of the SVM and weights. Motivated by general ensemble techniques, which are known to improve accuracy, I directly adopt the boosting algorithm to the newly proposed weighted KM-SVM (and wSVM). For predictive performance, a range of simulation studies demonstrate that the weighted KM-SVM (and wSVM) with boosting outperforms the standard KM-SVM (and SVM) including but not limited to many popular classification rules. I applied the proposed methods to simulated data and two large-scale real applications in the TCGA pan-cancer methylation data of breast and kidney cancer. In conclusion, the weighted KM-SVM (and wSVM) increases accuracy of the classification model, and will facilitate disease diagnosis and clinical treatment decisions to benefit patients. A software package (wSVM) is publicly available at the R-project webpage (https://www.r-project.org).",0,
30567473,Cloud-BS: A MapReduce-based bisulfite sequencing aligner on cloud.,"In recent years, there have been many studies utilizing DNA methylome data to answer fundamental biological questions. Bisulfite sequencing (BS-seq) has enabled measurement of a genome-wide absolute level of DNA methylation at single-nucleotide resolution. However, due to the ambiguity introduced by bisulfite-treatment, the aligning process especially in large-scale epigenetic research is still considered a huge burden. We present Cloud-BS, an efficient BS-seq aligner designed for parallel execution on a distributed environment. Utilizing Apache Hadoop framework, Cloud-BS splits sequencing reads into multiple blocks and transfers them to distributed nodes. By designing each aligning procedure into separate map and reducing tasks while an internal key-value structure is optimized based on the MapReduce programming model, the algorithm significantly improves alignment performance without sacrificing mapping accuracy. In addition, Cloud-BS minimizes the innate burden of configuring a distributed environment by providing a pre-configured cloud image. Cloud-BS shows significantly improved bisulfite alignment performance compared to other existing BS-seq aligners. We believe our algorithm facilitates large-scale methylome data analysis.

30422398,Structural basis for protein phosphatase 1 recruitment by glycogen-targeting subunits.,"The rate-limiting enzymes in glycogen metabolism are subject to regulation by reversible phosphorylation. The glycogen-targeted protein phosphatase 1 (PP1) holoenzyme catalyzes their dephosphorylation. It is composed of a catalytic subunit (PP1C) and a glycogen-targeting subunit (G subunit). To date, seven G subunits have been identified. They all contain an RVxF PP1C-binding motif. The interactions between this motif in the skeletal muscle-specific G<sub>M</sub> and PP1C have been revealed by structural studies. However, whether elements outside of this motif contribute to the interaction with PP1C is not clear. In this study, we found that residues next to the RVxF motif in G<sub>M</sub> also mediate interactions to PP1C and revealed the mechanism of the interaction by structural studies. Sequence analysis revealed that the PP1C-binding region in G<sub>M</sub> is highly conserved among G subunits. Consistently, we found that the equivalent region in the liver-enriched G<sub>L</sub> adopts a similar structure upon binding PP1C. Dephosphorylation experiments indicated that this region and the glycogen-binding region in G<sub>M</sub> cooperate to stimulate PP1C's activity toward glycogen-associated substrates. DATABASES: The structure factors and coordinates for the PP1Ca-G<sub>M</sub> (1-99) and PP1Ca-G<sub>L</sub> (31-105) complexes have been deposited into the Protein Data Bank (http://www.pdb.org), with the accession codes 5ZQV and 5ZT0, respectively.",0,
21821666,NeuroPedia: neuropeptide database and spectral library.,"<h4>Summary</h4>Neuropeptides are essential for cell-cell communication in neurological and endocrine physiological processes in health and disease. While many neuropeptides have been identified in previous studies, the resulting data has not been structured to facilitate further analysis by tandem mass spectrometry (MS/MS), the main technology for high-throughput neuropeptide identification. Many neuropeptides are difficult to identify when searching MS/MS spectra against large protein databases because of their atypical lengths (e.g. shorter/longer than common tryptic peptides) and lack of tryptic residues to facilitate peptide ionization/fragmentation. NeuroPedia is a neuropeptide encyclopedia of peptide sequences (including genomic and taxonomic information) and spectral libraries of identified MS/MS spectra of homolog neuropeptides from multiple species. Searching neuropeptide MS/MS data against known NeuroPedia sequences will improve the sensitivity of database search tools. Moreover, the availability of neuropeptide spectral libraries will also enable the utilization of spectral library search tools, which are known to further improve the sensitivity of peptide identification. These will also reinforce the confidence in peptide identifications by enabling visual comparisons between new and previously identified neuropeptide MS/MS spectra.<h4>Availability</h4>http://proteomics.ucsd.edu/Software/NeuroPedia.html<h4>Contact</h4>bandeira@ucsd.edu<h4>Supplementary information</h4>Supplementary materials are available at Bioinformatics online.",1,
34282687,Glucosinolate-Enriched Fractions from Maca (<i>Lepidium meyenii</i>) Exert Myrosinase-Dependent Cytotoxic Effects against HepG2/C3A and HT29 Tumor Cell Lines.,"The consumption of glucosinolate (GL)-rich foods, including <i>Brassica</i> vegetables, such as mustard, broccoli, and maca, is associated with decreased risk of developing cancer. The GL content in maca, which is recognized as a ""superfood"", is approximately 100-times higher than that in other brassicas. Although maca is a potential dietary source of GLs, limited studies have examined the bioactivity of maca GLs using the combination of chemical characterization and bioassays. In this study, the fractions (Lm-II and Lm-III) rich in intact GLs (glucotropaeolin and glucolimnanthin) were isolated and characterized from maca ethanolic extracts using chromatography and mass spectrometry. Additionally, the growth-inhibitory effects of Lm-II and Lm-II fractions against hepatocellular carcinoma (HepG2/C3A) and colon adenocarcinoma (HT29) cell lines were examined in the absence or presence of myrosinase (MYR). Fractions lacking low molecular weight sugars dose-dependently exerted cytotoxic effects in the presence of MYR. The half-maximal inhibitory concentration values of Lm-II and Lm-III against HepG2/C3A were 118.8 and 69.9 µg/mL, respectively, while those against HT29 were 102.6 and 71.5 µg/mL, respectively. These results suggest that the anticancer properties of maca can be attributed to GLs and corroborate the categorization of maca as a ""superfood.""Supplemental data for this article is available online at https://doi.org/10.1080/01635581.2021.1952444.",0,

MiRNAs are found to regulate diverse cancer-related processes by targeting a large set of oncogenic and tumor-suppressive genes. To establish a high-confidence reference resource for studying the miRNA-regulated target genes and cellular processes in cancer, we manually curated 2259 entries of cancer-related miRNA regulations with direct experimental evidence from ~9000 abstracts, covering more than 300 miRNAs and 829 target genes across 25 cancer tissues. A web-based portal named oncomiRDB, which provides both graphical and text-based interfaces, was developed for easily browsing and searching all the annotations.

21467251,Patient-specific radiation dose and cancer risk for pediatric chest CT.,"<h4>Purpose</h4>To estimate patient-specific radiation dose and cancer risk for pediatric chest computed tomography (CT) and to evaluate factors affecting dose and risk, including patient size, patient age, and scanning parameters.<h4>Materials and methods</h4>The institutional review board approved this study and waived informed consent. This study was HIPAA compliant. The study included 30 patients (0-16 years old), for whom full-body computer models were recently created from clinical CT data. A validated Monte Carlo program was used to estimate organ dose from eight chest protocols, representing clinically relevant combinations of bow tie filter, collimation, pitch, and tube potential. Organ dose was used to calculate effective dose and risk index (an index of total cancer incidence risk). The dose and risk estimates before and after normalization by volume-weighted CT dose index (CTDI(vol)) or dose-length product (DLP) were correlated with patient size and age. The effect of each scanning parameter was studied.<h4>Results</h4>Organ dose normalized by tube current-time product or CTDI(vol) decreased exponentially with increasing average chest diameter. Effective dose normalized by tube current-time product or DLP decreased exponentially with increasing chest diameter. Chest diameter was a stronger predictor of dose than weight and total scan length. Risk index normalized by tube current-time product or DLP decreased exponentially with both chest diameter and age. When normalized by DLP, effective dose and risk index were independent of collimation, pitch, and tube potential (<10% variation).<h4>Conclusion</h4>The correlations of dose and risk with patient size and age can be used to estimate patient-specific dose and risk. They can further guide the design and optimization of pediatric chest CT protocols.<h4>Supplemental material</h4>http://radiology.rsna.org/lookup/suppl/doi:10.1148/radiol.11101900/-/DC1.",0,

23824634,Validating a Coarse-Grained Potential Energy Function through Protein Loop Modelling.,"Coarse-grained (CG) methods for sampling protein conformational space have the potential to increase computational efficiency by reducing the degrees of freedom. The gain in computational efficiency of CG methods often comes at the expense of non-protein like local conformational features. This could cause problems when transitioning to full atom models in a hierarchical framework. Here, a CG potential energy function was validated by applying it to the problem of loop prediction. A novel method to sample the conformational space of backbone atoms was benchmarked using a standard test set consisting of 351 distinct loops. This method used a sequence-independent CG potential energy function representing the protein using [Formula: see text]-carbon positions only and sampling conformations with a Monte Carlo simulated annealing based protocol. Backbone atoms were added using a method previously described and then gradient minimised in the Rosetta force field. Despite the CG potential energy function being sequence-independent, the method performed similarly to methods that explicitly use either fragments of known protein backbones with similar sequences or residue-specific [Formula: see text]/[Formula: see text]-maps to restrict the search space. The method was also able to predict with sub-Angstrom accuracy two out of seven loops from recently solved crystal structures of proteins with low sequence and structure similarity to previously deposited structures in the PDB. The ability to sample realistic loop conformations directly from a potential energy function enables the incorporation of additional geometric restraints and the use of more advanced sampling methods in a way that is not possible to do easily with fragment replacement methods and also enable multi-scale simulations for protein design and protein structure prediction. These restraints could be derived from experimental data or could be design restraints in the case of computational protein design.

PMC8090191,Study of Patients‚Äô Characteristics and Mutual Impact Between Covid-19 and Hyperglycemia at a Community Hospital in Central Brooklyn,"Abstract Background: Studies have shown that poorly-controlled hyperglycemia worsens the outcomes in patients with COVID-19 (C-19) and C-19 may damage pancreatic islets via ACE2 receptors causing acute hyperglycemia. The major population we serve at Kingsbrook Jewish Medical Center (KJMC) are underprivileged with many of them having multiple comorbidities. Methods: This is a retrospective study wherein patients, admitted from February 2020 to April 2020 with hyperglycemia, were selected and divided into 2 groups based on presence or absence of C-19. Data include demographics, comorbidities, blood glucose level, serum osmolality, serum bicarbonate, anion gap, acute kidney injury (AKI), serum creatinine, ICU admission, length of stay (LOS) and mortality. Data were analyzed using descriptive study and T-test. Results: 100 patients were included in the C-19 group (CG) and 88 patients were included in the Non C-19 group (NCG). Major comorbidities were similar in both groups including HTN, DM, CKD followed by ESRD. Mean age of patients (years) was 65.68 in CG and 61.17 in NCG. 61% were male in CG and 53.41% were male in NCG. 16% and 9% developed DKA and HHS in CG, and 13.64% and 6.82% developed DKA and HHS in NCG respectively. 15% in CG had combined DKA & HHS and 3.41% had same in NCG. Mean blood glucose level (mg/dl) was 541.6 in CG and 460.0 in NCG (p=0.03). Mean serum osmolality (mOsm/kg) was 335.7 (SD±41.01) in CG and 317.1 (SD±30.54) in NCG (p=0.01). Mean serum bicarbonate (mEq/L) was 17.73 (SD±6.31) in CG and 21.46 (SD±5.94) in NCG (p<0.0001). Mean anion gap was 17.93 (SD±7.6) in CG and 13.10 (SD±7.2) in NCG (p<0.0001). 56% in CG and 37% in NCG developed AKI respectively (p=0.01). Mean serum creatinine (mg/dl) was 4.22 in CG and 1.65 in NCG (p=0.004). 55% of CG were admitted to ICU and 34% of NCG were admitted to ICU (p=0.003). Median LOS (days) in discharged patients was 8 in CG and 5 in NCG (p=0.02). Mortality was 40% in CG and 3.41% in NCG (p<0.0001). 12 patients in CG and 2 patients in NCG developed new-onset diabetes. In the subset of DKA, interestingly, mean age (years) was 61.63 (SD±17.73) in CG and 39.67 in NCG (SD±13.39) (p=0.001). Conclusion: In our study, patients in the CG carry worse laboratory parameters, unfavorable clinical outcomes and strikingly higher mortality. We discovered increased incidence of new-onset diabetes and elderly DKA in CG. In an inner city population like ours, the burden of DM with significant social and health care disparities is quite severe. Diabetic patients with concurrent C-19 infection can have particularly negative outcomes and C-19 possibly damages the pancreatic islets resulting in acute hyperglycemic crisis. Further research on larger population is required.

29701446,Prenatal Organophosphate Pesticide Exposure and Traits Related to Autism Spectrum Disorders in a Population Living in Proximity to Agriculture.,"<h4>Background</h4>Prenatal exposure to organophosphate (OP) pesticides has been linked with poorer neurodevelopment and behaviors related to autism spectrum disorders (ASD) in previous studies, including in the Center for Health Assessment of Mothers and Children of Salinas (CHAMACOS) study, a birth cohort living in the agricultural Salinas Valley in California.<h4>Objectives</h4>To investigate the association of prenatal exposure to OP pesticides with traits related to ASD, in childhood and adolescents in CHAMACOS.<h4>Methods</h4>We assessed OP exposure during pregnancy with measurements of dialkyl phosphates (DAP) metabolites in urine, and residential proximity to OP use during pregnancy using California's Pesticide Use Reporting (PUR) data and estimated associations with ASD-related traits using linear regression models. We measured traits reported by parents and teachers as well as the child's performance on tests that evaluate the ability to use facial expressions to recognize the mental state of others at 7, 10<sup>1</sup>/<sub>2</sub>, and 14 years of age.<h4>Results</h4>Prenatal DAPs were associated with poorer parent and teacher reported social behavior [e.g., a 10-fold DAP increase was associated with a 2.7-point increase (95% confidence interval (CI): 0.9, 4.5) in parent-reported Social Responsiveness Scale, Version 2, T-scores at age 14]. We did not find clear evidence of associations between residential proximity to OP use during pregnancy and ASD-related traits.<h4>Conclusions</h4>These findings contribute mixed evidence linking OP pesticide exposures with traits related to developmental disorders like ASD. Subtle pesticide-related effects on ASD-related traits among a population with ubiquitous exposure could result in a rise in cases of clinically diagnosed disorders like ASD. https://doi.org/10.1289/EHP2580.",0,
26833341,Integrative analysis for identifying joint modular patterns of gene-expression and drug-response data.,"<h4>Motivation</h4>The underlying relationship between genomic factors and the response of diverse cancer drugs still remains unclear. A number of studies showed that the heterogeneous responses to anticancer treatments of patients were partly associated with their specific changes in gene expression and somatic alterations. The emerging large-scale pharmacogenomic data provide us valuable opportunities to improve existing therapies or to guide early-phase clinical trials of compounds under development. However, how to identify the underlying combinatorial patterns among pharmacogenomics data are still a challenging issue.<h4>Results</h4>In this study, we adopted a sparse network-regularized partial least square (SNPLS) method to identify joint modular patterns using large-scale pairwise gene-expression and drug-response data. We incorporated a molecular network to the (sparse) partial least square model to improve the module accuracy via a network-based penalty. We first demonstrated the effectiveness of SNPLS using a set of simulation data and compared it with two typical methods. Further, we applied it to gene expression profiles for 13 321 genes and pharmacological profiles for 98 anticancer drugs across 641 cancer cell lines consisting of diverse types of human cancers. We identified 20 gene-drug co-modules, each of which consists of 30 cell lines, 137 genes and 2 drugs on average. The majority of identified co-modules have significantly functional implications and coordinated gene-drug associations. The modular analysis here provided us new insights into the molecular mechanisms of how drugs act and suggested new drug targets for therapy of certain types of cancers.<h4>Availability and implementation</h4>A matlab package of SNPLS is available at http://page.amss.ac.cn/shihua.zhang/<h4>Contact</h4>: zsh@amss.ac.cn<h4>Supplementary information</h4>Supplementary data are available at Bioinformatics online.",0,
24524735,QSAR modeling of imbalanced high-throughput screening data in PubChem.,"Many of the structures in PubChem are annotated with activities determined in high-throughput screening (HTS) assays. Because of the nature of these assays, the activity data are typically strongly imbalanced, with a small number of active compounds contrasting with a very large number of inactive compounds. We have used several such imbalanced PubChem HTS assays to test and develop strategies to efficiently build robust QSAR models from imbalanced data sets. Different descriptor types [Quantitative Neighborhoods of Atoms (QNA) and ""biological"" descriptors] were used to generate a variety of QSAR models in the program GUSAR. The models obtained were compared using external test and validation sets. We also report on our efforts to incorporate the most predictive of our models in the publicly available NCI/CADD Group Web services ( http://cactus.nci.nih.gov/chemical/apps/cap).",0,
32150354,Visualizing Human Protein-Protein Interactions and Subcellular Localizations on Cell Images Through CellMap.,"Visualizing protein data remains a challenging and stimulating task. Useful and intuitive visualization tools may help advance biomolecular and medical research; unintuitive tools may bar important breakthroughs. This protocol describes two use cases for the CellMap (http://cellmap.protein.properties) web tool. The tool allows researchers to visualize human protein-protein interaction data constrained by protein subcellular localizations. In the simplest form, proteins are visualized on cell images that also show protein-protein interactions (PPIs) through lines (edges) connecting the proteins across the compartments. At a glance, this simultaneously highlights spatial constraints that proteins are subject to in their physical environment and visualizes PPIs against these localizations. Visualizing two realities helps in decluttering the protein interaction visualization from ""hairball"" phenomena that arise when single proteins or groups thereof interact with hundreds of partners. © 2019 The Authors.

26353840,Reveel: large-scale population genotyping using low-coverage sequencing data.,"<h4>Motivation</h4>Population low-coverage whole-genome sequencing is rapidly emerging as a prominent approach for discovering genomic variation and genotyping a cohort. This approach combines substantially lower cost than full-coverage sequencing with whole-genome discovery of low-allele frequency variants, to an extent that is not possible with array genotyping or exome sequencing. However, a challenging computational problem arises of jointly discovering variants and genotyping the entire cohort. Variant discovery and genotyping are relatively straightforward tasks on a single individual that has been sequenced at high coverage, because the inference decomposes into the independent genotyping of each genomic position for which a sufficient number of confidently mapped reads are available. However, in low-coverage population sequencing, the joint inference requires leveraging the complex linkage disequilibrium (LD) patterns in the cohort to compensate for sparse and missing data in each individual. The potentially massive computation time for such inference, as well as the missing data that confound low-frequency allele discovery, need to be overcome for this approach to become practical.<h4>Results</h4>Here, we present Reveel, a novel method for single nucleotide variant calling and genotyping of large cohorts that have been sequenced at low coverage. Reveel introduces a novel technique for leveraging LD that deviates from previous Markov-based models, and which is aimed at computational efficiency as well as accuracy in capturing LD patterns present in rare haplotypes. We evaluate Reveel's performance through extensive simulations as well as real data from the 1000 Genomes Project, and show that it achieves higher accuracy in low-frequency allele discovery and substantially lower computation cost than previous state-of-the-art methods.<h4>Availability and implementation</h4>http://reveel.stanford.edu/<h4>Contact</h4>: serafim@cs.stanford.edu<h4>Supplementary information</h4>Supplementary data are available at Bioinformatics online.",0,

Pathway maps created using GeneGO Metacore provide the biological relationships between proteins and illustrate concepts for multiplexed analysis; each protein can be selected to examine assay development at the protein and peptide levels.<h4>Results</h4>The coupling of SDS-PAGE and multiple reaction monitoring mass spectrometry screening has been used to detect 876 peptides from 218 cancer-related proteins in model systems including colon, lung, melanoma, leukemias, and myeloma, which has led to the development of 95 quantitative assays including stable-isotope-labeled peptide standards. Methods are published online and peptide standards are made available to the research community. Protein expression measurements for heat shock proteins, including a comparison with ELISA and monitoring response to the HSP90 inhibitor, 17-(dimethylaminoethylamino)-17-demethoxygeldanamycin (17-DMAG), are used to illustrate the components of the QuAD and its potential utility.<h4>Conclusions and clinical relevance</h4>This resource enables quantitative assessment of protein components of signaling pathways and biological processes and holds promise for systematic investigation of treatment responses in cancer.",1,
26061870,Human Chromosome Y and Haplogroups; introducing YDHS Database.,"<h4>Background</h4>As the high throughput sequencing efforts generate more biological information, scientists from different disciplines are interpreting the polymorphisms that make us unique. In addition, there is an increasing trend in general public to research their own genealogy, find distant relatives and to know more about their biological background. Commercial vendors are providing analyses of mitochondrial and Y-chromosomal markers for such purposes. Clearly, an easy-to-use free interface to the existing data on the identified variants would be in the interest of general public and professionals less familiar with the field. Here we introduce a novel metadatabase YDHS that aims to provide such an interface for Y-chromosomal DNA (Y-DNA) haplogroups and sequence variants.<h4>Methods</h4>The database uses ISOGG Y-DNA tree as the source of mutations and haplogroups and by using genomic positions of the mutations the database links them to genes and other biological entities. YDHS contains analysis tools for deeper Y-SNP analysis.<h4>Results</h4>YDHS addresses the shortage of Y-DNA related databases. We have tested our database using a set of different cases from literature ranging from infertility to autism. The database is at http://www.semanticgen.net/ydhs<h4>Conclusions</h4>Y-chromosomal DNA (Y-DNA) haplogroups and sequence variants have not been in the scientific limelight, excluding certain specialized fields like forensics, mainly because there is not much freely available information or it is scattered in different sources. However, as we have demonstrated Y-SNPs do play a role in various cases on the haplogroup level and it is possible to create a free Y-DNA dedicated bioinformatics resource.",1,
27794041,NGSmethDB 2017: enhanced methylomes and differential methylation.,"The 2017 update of NGSmethDB stores whole genome methylomes generated from short-read data sets obtained by bisulfite sequencing (WGBS) technology. To generate high-quality methylomes, stringent quality controls were integrated with third-part software, adding also a two-step mapping process to exploit the advantages of the new genome assembly models. The samples were all profiled under constant parameter settings, thus enabling comparative downstream analyses. Besides a significant increase in the number of samples, NGSmethDB now includes two additional data-types, which are a valuable resource for the discovery of methylation epigenetic biomarkers: (i) differentially methylated single-cytosines; and (ii) methylation segments (i.e. genome regions of homogeneous methylation). The NGSmethDB back-end is now based on MongoDB, a NoSQL hierarchical database using JSON-formatted documents and dynamic schemas, thus accelerating sample comparative analyses. Besides conventional database dumps, track hubs were implemented, which improved database access, visualization in genome browsers and comparative analyses to third-part annotations. In addition, the database can be also accessed through a RESTful API. Lastly, a Python client and a multiplatform virtual machine allow for program-driven access from user desktop. This way, private methylation data can be compared to NGSmethDB without the need to upload them to public servers. Database website: http://bioinfo2.ugr.es/NGSmethDB.",1,
27531102,iRSpot-EL: identify recombination spots with an ensemble learning approach.,"<h4>Motivation</h4>Coexisting in a DNA system, meiosis and recombination are two indispensible aspects for cell reproduction and growth. With the avalanche of genome sequences emerging in the post-genomic age, it is an urgent challenge to acquire the information of DNA recombination spots because it can timely provide very useful insights into the mechanism of meiotic recombination and the process of genome evolution.<h4>Results</h4>To address such a challenge, we have developed a predictor, called IRSPOT-EL: , by fusing different modes of pseudo K-tuple nucleotide composition and mode of dinucleotide-based auto-cross covariance into an ensemble classifier of clustering approach. Five-fold cross tests on a widely used benchmark dataset have indicated that the new predictor remarkably outperforms its existing counterparts. Particularly, far beyond their reach, the new predictor can be easily used to conduct the genome-wide analysis and the results obtained are quite consistent with the experimental map.<h4>Availability and implementation</h4>For the convenience of most experimental scientists, a user-friendly web-server for iRSpot-EL has been established at http://bioinformatics.hitsz.edu.cn/iRSpot-EL/, by which users can easily obtain their desired results without the need to go through the complicated mathematical equations involved.<h4>Contact</h4>bliu@gordonlifescience.org or bliu@insun.hit.edu.cnSupplementary information: Supplementary data are available at Bioinformatics online.",0,

Aiming to add genetic information potentially useful for novel targets discovery, we performed an extensive genomic characterization by whole-exome sequencing and SNP array profiling of six cutaneous melanoma cell lines derived from metastatic patients. We obtained a total of 3,325 novel coding single nucleotide variants, including 2,172 non-synonymous variants. We catalogued the coding mutations according to Sanger COSMIC database and to a manually curated list including genes involved in melanoma pathways identified by mining recent literature. Besides confirming the presence of known melanoma driver mutations (BRAF(V600E), NRAS(Q61R) ), we identified novel mutated genes involved in signalling pathways crucial for melanoma pathogenesis and already addressed by current targeted therapies (such as MAPK and glutamate pathways). We also identified mutations in four genes (MUC19, PAICS, RBMXL1, KIF23) never reported in melanoma, which might deserve further investigations. All data are available to the entire research community in our Melanoma Exome Database (at https://155.253.6.64/MExDB/). In summary, these cell lines are valuable biological tools to improve the genetic comprehension of this complex cancer disease and to study functional relevance of individual mutational events, and these findings could provide insights potentially useful for identification of novel therapeutic targets for cutaneous malignant melanoma.",1,

The 5th National Audit Project was designed to investigate the reported incidence, predisposing factors, causality and impact of accidental awareness. A nationwide network of local co-ordinators across all UK and Irish public hospitals reported all new patient reports of accidental awareness to a central database, using a system of monthly anonymised reporting over a calendar year. The database collected the details of the reported event, anaesthetic and surgical technique, and any sequelae. These reports were categorised into main types by a multidisciplinary panel, using a formalised process of analysis. The main categories of accidental awareness were: certain or probable; possible; during sedation; on or from the intensive care unit; could not be determined; unlikely; drug errors; and statement only. The degree of evidence to support the categorisation was also defined for each report. Patient experience and sequelae were categorised using current tools or modifications of such. The 5th National Audit Project methodology may be used to assess new reports of accidental awareness during general anaesthesia in a standardised manner, especially for the development of an ongoing database of case reporting. This paper is a shortened version describing the protocols, methods and data analysis from 5th National Audit Project - the full report can be found at http://www.nationalauditprojects.org.uk/NAP5_home#pt.",0,
29126312,MeT-DB V2.0: elucidating context-specific functions of N6-methyl-adenosine methyltranscriptome.,"Methyltranscriptome is an exciting new area that studies the mechanisms and functions of methylation in transcripts. A knowledge base with the systematic collection and curation of context specific transcriptome-wide methylations is critical for elucidating their biological functions as well as for developing bioinformatics tools. Since its inception in 2014, the Met-DB (Liu, H., Flores, M.A., Meng, J., Zhang, L., Zhao, X., Rao, M.K., Chen, Y. and Huang, Y. (2015) MeT-DB: a database of transcriptome methylation in mammalian cells. Nucleic Acids Res., 43, D197-D203), has become an important resource for methyltranscriptome, especially in the N6-methyl-adenosine (m6A) research community. Here, we report Met-DB v2.0, the significantly improved second version of Met-DB, which is entirely redesigned to focus more on elucidating context-specific m6A functions. Met-DB v2.0 has a major increase in context-specific m6A peaks and single-base sites predicted from 185 samples for 7 species from 26 independent studies. Moreover, it is also integrated with a new database for targets of m6A readers, erasers and writers and expanded with more collections of functional data. The redesigned Met-DB v2.0 web interface and genome browser provide more friendly, powerful, and informative ways to query and visualize the data. More importantly, MeT-DB v2.0 offers for the first time a series of tools specifically designed for understanding m6A functions. Met-DB V2.0 will be a valuable resource for m6A methyltranscriptome research. The Met-DB V2.0 database is available at http://compgenomics.utsa.edu/MeTDB/ and http://www.xjtlu.edu.cn/metdb2.",1,
29149877,Key bottlenecks to the provision of safe obstetric anaesthesia in low- income countries; a cross-sectional survey of 64 hospitals in Uganda.,"<h4>Background</h4>Despite recent advances in surgery and anaesthesia which significantly improve safety, many health facilities in low-and middle-income countries (LMICs) remain chronically under-resourced with inability to cope effectively with serious obstetric complications (Knight et al., PLoS One 8:e63846, 2013). As a result many of these countries still have unacceptably high maternal and neonatal mortality rates. Recent data at the national referral hospitals in East Africa reported that none of the national referral hospitals met the World Federation of Societies of Anesthesiologists (WFSA) international standards required to provide safe obstetric anaesthesia (Epiu I: Challenges of Anesthesia in Low-and Middle-Income Countries. WFSA; 2014 http://wfsa.newsweaver.com/Newsletter/p8c8ta4ri7a1wsacct9y3u?a=2&p=47730565&t=27996496 ). In spite of this evidence, factors contributing to maternal mortality related to anaesthesia in LMICs and the magnitude of these issues have not been comprehensively studied. We therefore set out to assess regional referral, district, private for profit and private not-for profit hospitals in Uganda.<h4>Methods</h4>We conducted a cross-sectional survey at 64 government and private hospitals in Uganda using pre-set questionnaires to the anaesthetists and hospital directors. Access to the minimum requirements for safe obstetric anaesthesia according to WFSA guidelines were also checked using a checklist for operating and recovery rooms.<h4>Results</h4>Response rate was 100% following personal interviews of anaesthetists, and hospital directors. Only 3 of the 64 (5%) of the hospitals had all requirements available to meet the WFSA International guidelines for safe anaesthesia. Additionally, 54/64 (84%) did not have a trained physician anaesthetist and 5/64 (8%) had no trained providers for anaesthesia at all. Frequent shortages of drugs were reported for regional/neuroaxial anaesthesia, and other essential drugs were often lacking such as antacids and antihypertensives. We noted that many of the anaesthesia machines present were obsolete models without functional safety alarms and/or mechanical ventilators. Continuous ECG was only available in 3/64 (5%) of hospitals.<h4>Conclusion</h4>We conclude that there is a significant lack of essential equipment for the delivery of safe anaesthesia across this region. This is compounded by the shortage of trained providers and inadequate supervision. It is therefore essential to strengthen anaesthesia services by addressing these specific deficiencies. This will include improved training of associate clinicians, training more physician anaesthetists and providing the basic equipment required to provide safe and effective care. These services are key components of comprehensive emergency obstetric care and anaesthetists are crucial in managing critically ill mothers and ensuring good surgical outcomes.",0,
30302823,Overlapping clustering of gene expression data using penalized weighted normalized cut.,"Clustering has been widely conducted in the analysis of gene expression data. For complex diseases, it has played an important role in identifying unknown functions of genes, serving as the basis of other analysis, and others. A common limitation of most existing clustering approaches is to assume that genes are separated into disjoint clusters. As genes often have multiple functions and thus can belong to more than one functional cluster, the disjoint clustering results can be unsatisfactory. In addition, due to the small sample sizes of genetic profiling studies and other factors, there may not be sufficient evidence to confirm the specific functions of some genes and cluster them definitively into disjoint clusters. In this study, we develop an effective overlapping clustering approach, which takes account into the multiplicity of gene functions and lack of certainty in practical analysis. A penalized weighted normalized cut (PWNCut) criterion is proposed based on the NCut technique and an <mml:math xmlns:mml=""http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML""><mml:msub><mml:mi>L</mml:mi> <mml:mn>2</mml:mn></mml:msub> </mml:math> norm constraint.

To facilitate implementation, we develop the function pwncut in the R package NCutYX.",0,
22058129,DistiLD Database: diseases and traits in linkage disequilibrium blocks.,"Genome-wide association studies (GWAS) have identified thousands of single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) associated with the risk of hundreds of diseases. However, there is currently no database that enables non-specialists to answer the following simple questions: which SNPs associated with diseases are in linkage disequilibrium (LD) with a gene of interest? Which chromosomal regions have been associated with a given disease, and which are the potentially causal genes in each region? To answer these questions, we use data from the HapMap Project to partition each chromosome into so-called LD blocks, so that SNPs in LD with each other are preferentially in the same block, whereas SNPs not in LD are in different blocks. By projecting SNPs and genes onto LD blocks, the DistiLD database aims to increase usage of existing GWAS results by making it easy to query and visualize disease-associated SNPs and genes in their chromosomal context.

26314578,MGFM: a novel tool for detection of tissue and cell specific marker genes from microarray gene expression data.,"<h4>Background</h4>Identification of marker genes associated with a specific tissue/cell type is a fundamental challenge in genetic and cell research. Marker genes are of great importance for determining cell identity, and for understanding tissue specific gene function and the molecular mechanisms underlying complex diseases.<h4>Results</h4>We have developed a new bioinformatics tool called MGFM (Marker Gene Finder in Microarray data) to predict marker genes from microarray gene expression data. Marker genes are identified through the grouping of samples of the same type with similar marker gene expression levels. We verified our approach using two microarray data sets from the NCBI's Gene Expression Omnibus public repository encompassing samples for similar sets of five human tissues (brain, heart, kidney, liver, and lung). Comparison with another tool for tissue-specific gene identification and validation with literature-derived established tissue markers established functionality, accuracy and simplicity of our tool. Furthermore, top ranked marker genes were experimentally validated by reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR). The sets of predicted marker genes associated with the five selected tissues comprised well-known genes of particular importance in these tissues. The tool is freely available from the Bioconductor web site, and it is also provided as an online application integrated into the CellFinder platform ( http://cellfinder.org/analysis/marker ).<h4>Conclusions</h4>MGFM is a useful tool to predict tissue/cell type marker genes using microarray gene expression data. The implementation of the tool as an R-package as well as an application within CellFinder facilitates its use.",0,

In this paper, we present (1) corrections to the published model, as well as (2) a software implementation of the model for numerical assessment. The software tool, Triglyceride Property Calculator (TPC), uses a semi-empirical model to estimate the enthalpy of fusion and melting temperature for a given triglyceride based on its molecular composition and polymorphic form. These estimates are compared to experimentally collected data when available. The web application is available at http://www.crcfoodandhealth.com (under research tools) and through the AOCS Lipid Library. The quality of estimates is characterized according to defined counting metrics and presented for TAG subcategories. Additionally, the extrapolative value of the TPC is assessed by checking for consistency with underlying thermodynamic constraints. The current TPC implementation is effective in describing experimentally collected melting point data, with greater¬†than 91% of the fitted values falling within 10% of the actual data. The TPC is also very good at describing collected enthalpy data. The underlying semi-empirical model and parameter set perform well in ensuring enthalpy predictions are thermodynamically consistent, however, extrapolated melting temperatures appear unreliable. Developing models and parameter sets that ensure thermodynamic consistency is a priority with future TPC iterations.",0,

The National Sexually Transmitted Disease Curriculum (NSTDC, https://www.std.uw.edu) is a free, online curriculum, funded by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. The purpose of this article is to evaluate the reach, utilization, and engagement of users with the curriculum.<h4>Methods</h4>Data on NSTDC utilization was collected for 24 months after the February 1, 2017 launch. For all users, Google Analytics was used to determine total number of users, geographic location, age and sex, and average session duration. For registered users, additional data analysis included work-role, demographics, and completion of self-study modules, check-on-learning questions, and question banks. User satisfaction was measured on a 5-point Likert scale.<h4>Results</h4>During the evaluation period, 136,270 individual users accessed the NSTDC, including 24,652 registered users.

21685100,Piecewise linear approximation of protein structures using the principle of minimum message length.,"<h4>Unlabelled</h4>Simple and concise representations of protein-folding patterns provide powerful abstractions for visualizations, comparisons, classifications, searching and aligning structural data. Structures are often abstracted by replacing standard secondary structural features-that is, helices and strands of sheet-by vectors or linear segments. Relying solely on standard secondary structure may result in a significant loss of structural information. Further, traditional methods of simplification crucially depend on the consistency and accuracy of external methods to assign secondary structures to protein coordinate data. Although many methods exist automatically to identify secondary structure, the impreciseness of definitions, along with errors and inconsistencies in experimental structure data, drastically limit their applicability to generate reliable simplified representations, especially for structural comparison. This article introduces a mathematically rigorous algorithm to delineate protein structure using the elegant statistical and inductive inference framework of minimum message length (MML). Our method generates consistent and statistically robust piecewise linear explanations of protein coordinate data, resulting in a powerful and concise representation of the structure. The delineation is completely independent of the approaches of using hydrogen-bonding patterns or inspecting local substructural geometry that the current methods use. Indeed, as is common with applications of the MML criterion, this method is free of parameters and thresholds, in striking contrast to the existing programs which are often beset by them. The analysis of results over a large number of proteins suggests that the method produces consistent delineation of structures that encompasses, among others, the segments corresponding to standard secondary structure.<h4>Availability</h4>http://www.csse.monash.edu.au/~karun/pmml.",0,

Modulating the interaction between proteins by means of small (chemical) agents is therefore a promising route for future novel therapeutic interventions. In this context, peptides are gaining momentum as emerging agents for the modulation of PPIs.<h4>Results</h4>We reported a novel computational, structure and knowledge-based approach to model orthosteric peptides to target PPIs: PiPreD. PiPreD relies on a precompiled and bespoken library of structural motifs, iMotifs, extracted from protein complexes and a fast structural modeling algorithm driven by the location of native chemical groups on the interface of the protein target named anchor residues. PiPreD comprehensive and systematically samples the entire interface deriving peptide conformations best suited for the given region on the protein interface.

The development of differentially diagnostic biomarkers for different subtypes largely depends on understanding the biological pathways and regulatory mechanisms associated with leukemia-implicated genes. Unfortunately, the leukemia-implicated genes that have been identified thus far are scattered among thousands of published studies, and no systematic summary of the differences between adult and childhood leukemia exists with regard to the causative genetic mutations and genetic mechanisms of the various subtypes. In this study, we performed a systematic literature review of those susceptibility genes reported in small-scale experiments and built an online gene database containing a total of 1805 leukemia-associated genes, available at http://soft.bioinfo-minzhao.org/lgl/.

However, little attention has been given to this phenomenon among eukaryotic species mainly due to the lower proportion of these events. In the last years, a vertiginous amount of new HT events involving eukaryotic species was reported in the literature, highlighting the need of a common repository to keep the scientific community up to date and describe overall trends. Recently, we published the first HT database focused on HT of transposable elements among eukaryotes: the Horizontal Transposon Transfer DataBase (http://lpa.saogabriel.unipampa.edu.br: 8080/httdatabase/). Here, we present new features and updates of this unique database: (i) its expansion to include virus-host exchange of genetic material, which we called Horizontal Virus Transfer (HVT) and (ii) the availability of a web server for HT detection, where we implemented the online version of vertical and horizontal inheritance consistence analysis (VHICA), an R package developed for HT detection. These improvements will help researchers to navigate through known HVT cases, take data-informed decision and export figures based on keywords searches. Moreover, the availability of the VHICA as an online tool will make this software easily reachable even for researchers with no or little computation knowledge as well as foster our capability to detect new HT events in a wide variety of taxa.

21600674,[EAU Guidelines on Urinary Incontinence].,"<h4>Context</h4>The first European Association of Urology (EAU) guidelines on incontinence were published in 2001. These guidelines were periodically updated in past years.<h4>Objective</h4>The aim of this paper is to present a summary of the 2009 update of the EAU guidelines on urinary incontinence (UI).<h4>Evidence acquisition</h4>The EAU working panel was part of the 4th International Consultation on Incontinence (ICI) and, with permission of the ICI, extracted the relevant data. The methodology of the 4th ICI was a comprehensive literature review by international experts and consensus formation. In addition, level of evidence was rated according to a modified Oxford system and grades of recommendation were given accordingly.<h4>Evidence summary</h4>A full version of the EAU guidelines on urinary incontinence is available as a printed document (extended and short form) and as a CD-ROM from the EAU office or online from the EAU Web site (http://www.uroweb.org/guidelines/online-guidelines/). The extent and invasiveness of assessment of UI depends on severity and/or complexity of symptoms and clinical signs and is different for men, women, frail older persons, children, and patients with neuropathy. At the level of initial management, basic diagnostic tests are applied to exclude an underlying disease or condition such as urinary tract infection. Treatment is mostly conservative (lifestyle interventions, physiotherapy, physical therapy, pharmacotherapy) and is of an empirical nature. At the level of specialised management (when primary therapy failed, diagnosis is unclear, or symptoms and/or signs are complex/severe),more elaborate assessment is generally required, including imaging, endoscopy, and urodynamics. Treatment options include invasive interventions and surgery.<h4>Conclusions</h4>Treatment options for UI are rapidly expanding. These EAU guidelines provide ratings of the evidence (guided by evidence-based medicine) and graded recommendations for the appropriate assessment and according treatment options and put them into clinical perspective.",0,
28444590,Transcripts of pectin-degrading enzymes and isolation of complete cDNA sequence of a pectate lyase gene induced by coffee white stem borer (Xylotrechus quadripes) in the bark tissue of Coffea canephora (robusta coffee).,"Of the two commercially cultivated coffee (Coffea) species, C. arabica (arabica) is highly susceptible and C. canephora (robusta) is highly resistant to the insect pest Xylotrechus quadripes (Coleoptera: Cerambycidae), commonly known as coffee white stem borer (CWSB). We constructed a forward-subtracted cDNA library by Suppression Subtractive Hybridization (SSH) from robusta bark tissue for profiling genes induced by CWSB infestation. Among the 265 unigenes of the SSH EST library, 7 unigenes (5 contigs and 2 singletons) matching different pectin-degrading enzymes were discovered. These ESTs matched one pectate lyase, three polygalacturonases, and one pectin acetylesterase gene. Quantitative real-time PCR (qRT-PCR) revealed that CWSB infestation strongly induces the pectate lyase gene at 72†h. Complete cDNA sequence of the pectate lyase gene was obtained through 3' and 5' RACE reactions. It was a 1595†bp long sequence that included full CDS and both UTRs. Against C. canephora genome sequences in Coffee Genome Hub database ( http://coffee-genome.org/ ), it had 22 matches to different pectate lyase genes mapped on 9 of the 11 pseudochromosomes, the top match being Cc07_g00190 Pectate lyase. In NCBI database, it matched pectate lyase sequences of several plants. Apart from C. canephora, the closest pectate lyase matches were from Sesamum indicum and Nicotiana tabacum. The pectinolytic enzymes discovered here are thought to play a role in the production of oligogalacturonides (OGs) which act as Damage-Associated Molecular Pattern (DAMP) signals eliciting innate immunity in plants. The pectate lyase gene, induced by CWSB infestation, along with other endogenous pectinolytic enzymes and CWSB-specific elicitors, may be involved in triggering basal defense responses to protect the CWSB-damaged tissue against pathogens, as well as to contain CWSB in robusta.",0,
33483306,Locus of Heat Resistance (LHR) in Meat-Borne Escherichia coli: Screening and Genetic Characterization.,"Microbial resistance to processing treatments poses a food safety concern, as treatment tolerant pathogens can emerge. Occasional foodborne outbreaks caused by pathogenic <i>Escherichia coli</i> have led to human and economic losses. Therefore, this study screened for the extreme heat resistance (XHR) phenotype as well as one known genetic marker, the locus of heat resistance (LHR), in 4,123 <i>E. coli</i> isolates from diverse meat animals at different processing stages. The prevalences of XHR and LHR among the meat-borne <i>E. coli</i> were found to be 10.3% and 11.4%, respectively, with 19% agreement between the two. Finished meat products showed the highest LHR prevalence (24.3%) compared to other processing stages (0 to 0.6%). None of the LHR<sup>+</sup> <i>E. coli</i> in this study would be considered pathogens based on screening for virulence genes. Four high-quality genomes were generated by whole-genome sequencing of representative LHR<sup>+</sup> isolates. Nine horizontally acquired LHRs were identified and characterized, four plasmid-borne and five chromosomal. Nine newly identified LHRs belong to ClpK1 LHR or ClpK2 LHR variants sharing 61 to 68% nucleotide sequence identity, while one LHR appears to be a hybrid. Our observations suggest positive correlation between the number of LHR regions present in isolates and the extent of heat resistance. The isolate exhibiting the highest degree of heat resistance possessed four LHRs belonging to three different variant groups. Maintenance of as many as four LHRs in a single genome emphasizes the benefits of the LHR in bacterial physiology and stress response.<b>IMPORTANCE</b> Currently, a ""multiple-hurdle"" approach based on a combination of different antimicrobial interventions, including heat, is being utilized during meat processing to control the burden of spoilage and pathogenic bacteria. Our recent study (M. Guragain, G. E. Smith, D. A. King, and J. M. Bosilevac, J Food Prot 83:1438-1443, 2020, https://doi.org/10.4315/JFP-20-103) suggests that U.S. beef cattle harbor <i>Escherichia coli</i> that possess the locus of heat resistance (LHR). LHR seemingly contributes to the global stress tolerance in bacteria and hence poses a food safety concern. Therefore, it is important to understand the distribution of the LHRs among meat-borne bacteria identified at different stages of different meat processing systems. Complete genome sequencing and comparative analysis of selected heat-resistant bacteria provide a clearer understanding of stress and heat resistance mechanisms. Further, sequencing data may offer a platform to gain further insights into the genetic background that provides optimal bacterial tolerance against heat and other processing treatments.",0,
25987413,A Scalable Approach for Protein False Discovery Rate Estimation in Large Proteomic Data Sets.,"Calculating the number of confidently identified proteins and estimating false discovery rate (FDR) is a challenge when analyzing very large proteomic data sets such as entire human proteomes. Biological and technical heterogeneity in proteomic experiments further add to the challenge and there are strong differences in opinion regarding the conceptual validity of a protein FDR and no consensus regarding the methodology for protein FDR determination. There are also limitations inherent to the widely used classic target-decoy strategy that particularly show when analyzing very large data sets and that lead to a strong over-representation of decoy identifications. In this study, we investigated the merits of the classic, as well as a novel target-decoy-based protein FDR estimation approach, taking advantage of a heterogeneous data collection comprised of ~19,000 LC-MS/MS runs deposited in ProteomicsDB (https://www.proteomicsdb.org). The ""picked"" protein FDR approach treats target and decoy sequences of the same protein as a pair rather than as individual entities and chooses either the target or the decoy sequence depending on which receives the highest score. We investigated the performance of this approach in combination with q-value based peptide scoring to normalize sample-, instrument-, and search engine-specific differences. The ""picked"" target-decoy strategy performed best when protein scoring was based on the best peptide q-value for each protein yielding a stable number of true positive protein identifications over a wide range of q-value thresholds. We show that this simple and unbiased strategy eliminates a conceptual issue in the commonly used ""classic"" protein FDR approach that causes overprediction of false-positive protein identification in large data sets. The approach scales from small to very large data sets without losing performance, consistently increases the number of true-positive protein identifications and is readily implemented in proteomics analysis software.",0,
32382359,Multiple Relapses of Visceral Leishmaniasis in HIV Co-Infected Patients: A Case Series from Ethiopia.,"Background:Human visceral leishmaniasis (VL) is a life-threatening protozoan disease caused by parasites belonging to the Leishmania donovani complex. Ethiopia has the highest VL-HIV co-infection rate in the world, with several of these patients presenting with repeated episodes of VL disease (ie, relapse). However, we lack data on how HIV patients with multiple VL relapse present clinically, and whether they continue to respond to currently available medicines. Methods:The medical records of VL-HIV co-infected patients with multiple VL relapses at the Leishmaniasis Treatment and Research Center in Gondar, Ethiopia, between June 2012 and June 2016 were retrieved. Variables on their clinical and laboratory profiles were collected. Descriptive analysis was done to show the characteristics of the VL episodes. Result:A total of 48 VL episodes in 12 patients were identified, the median number of episodes per patient was 5 (interquartile range, 4-8 episodes). The median time to relapse was 5 months (interquartile range, 3-5.5 months). Splenomegaly was present in 47 of the episodes (98%), fever or other accompanying symptoms were present in only 66% (32 out of 48). The median tissue parasite grade at VL diagnosis was 6+ (interquartile range, 5+- 6+). All patients were on antiretroviral therapy. The median duration of treatment per episode was 2 months (interquartile range, 2-2 months). All patients achieved parasitological cure at discharge at each episode. Conclusions:Multiple recurrences of VL diseases were observed in HIV co-infected patients. With recurrent episodes, splenomegaly was found to be the main manifestation, whereas fever was less common. These patients came with recurrence of diseases in <6 months and required prolonged treatment to achieve cure.Further research on prediction, prevention, and better management options for recurrent VL is needed.

33130899,Functional analysis of low-grade glioma genetic variants predicts key target genes and transcription factors.,"<h4>Background</h4>Large-scale genome-wide association studies (GWAS) have implicated thousands of germline genetic variants in modulating individuals' risk to various diseases, including cancer. At least 25 risk loci have been identified for low-grade gliomas (LGGs), but their molecular functions remain largely unknown.<h4>Methods</h4>We hypothesized that GWAS loci contain causal single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) that reside in accessible open chromatin regions and modulate the expression of target genes by perturbing the binding affinity of transcription factors (TFs). We performed an integrative analysis of genomic and epigenomic data from The Cancer Genome Atlas and other public repositories to identify candidate causal SNPs within linkage disequilibrium blocks of LGG GWAS loci. We assessed their potential regulatory role via in silico TF binding sequence perturbations, convolutional neural network trained on TF binding data, and simulated annealing-based interpretation methods.<h4>Results</h4>We built an interactive website (http://education.knoweng.org/alg3/) summarizing the functional footprinting of 280 variants in 25 LGG GWAS regions, providing rich information for further computational and experimental scrutiny. We identified as case studies PHLDB1 and SLC25A26 as candidate target genes of rs12803321 and rs11706832, respectively, and predicted the GWAS variant rs648044 to be the causal SNP modulating ZBTB16, a known tumor suppressor in multiple cancers. We showed that rs648044 likely perturbed the binding affinity of the TF MAFF, as supported by RNA interference and in vitro MAFF binding experiments.<h4>Conclusions</h4>The identified candidate (causal SNP, target gene, TF) triplets and the accompanying resource will help accelerate our understanding of the molecular mechanisms underlying genetic risk factors for gliomas.",0,
23685613,Prediction of clustered RNA-binding protein motif sites in the mammalian genome.,"Sequence-specific interactions of RNA-binding proteins (RBPs) with their target transcripts are essential for post-transcriptional gene expression regulation in mammals. However, accurate prediction of RBP motif sites has been difficult because many RBPs recognize short and degenerate sequences. Here we describe a hidden Markov model (HMM)-based algorithm mCarts to predict clustered functional RBP-binding sites by effectively integrating the number and spacing of individual motif sites, their accessibility in local RNA secondary structures and cross-species conservation. This algorithm learns and quantifies rules of these features, taking advantage of a large number of in vivo RBP-binding sites obtained from cross-linking and immunoprecipitation data. We applied this algorithm to study two representative RBP families, Nova and Mbnl, which regulate tissue-specific alternative splicing through interacting with clustered YCAY and YGCY elements, respectively, and predicted their binding sites in the mouse transcriptome. Despite the low information content in individual motif elements, our algorithm made specific predictions for successful experimental validation. Analysis of predicted sites also revealed cases of extensive and distal RBP-binding sites important for splicing regulation. This algorithm can be readily applied to other RBPs to infer their RNA-regulatory networks. The software is freely available at http://zhanglab.c2b2.columbia.edu/index.php/MCarts.",0,

30423080,DREAM-Yara: an exact read mapper for very large databases with short update time.,"<h4>Motivation</h4>Mapping-based approaches have become limited in their application to very large sets of references since computing an FM-index for very large databases (e.g. >10 GB) has become a bottleneck. This affects many analyses that need such index as an essential step for approximate matching of the NGS reads to reference databases. For instance, in typical metagenomics analysis, the size of the reference sequences has become prohibitive to compute a single full-text index on standard machines. Even on large memory machines, computing such index takes about 1 day of computing time. As a result, updates of indices are rarely performed. Hence, it is desirable to create an alternative way of indexing while preserving fast search times.<h4>Results</h4>To solve the index construction and update problem we propose the DREAM (Dynamic seaRchablE pArallel coMpressed index) framework and provide an implementation. The main contributions are the introduction of an approximate search distributor via a novel use of Bloom filters. We combine several Bloom filters to form an interleaved Bloom filter and use this new data structure to quickly exclude reads for parts of the databases where they cannot match. This allows us to keep the databases in several indices which can be easily rebuilt if parts are updated while maintaining a fast search time. The second main contribution is an implementation of DREAM-Yara a distributed version of a fully sensitive read mapper under the DREAM framework.<h4>Availability and implementation</h4>https://gitlab.com/pirovc/dream_yara/.",0,
27559155,Fast-SNP: a fast matrix pre-processing algorithm for efficient loopless flux optimization of metabolic models.,"<h4>Motivation</h4>Computation of steady-state flux solutions in large metabolic models is routinely performed using flux balance analysis based on a simple LP (Linear Programming) formulation. A minimal requirement for thermodynamic feasibility of the flux solution is the absence of internal loops, which are enforced using 'loopless constraints'. The resulting loopless flux problem is a substantially harder MILP (Mixed Integer Linear Programming) problem, which is computationally expensive for large metabolic models.<h4>Results</h4>We developed a pre-processing algorithm that significantly reduces the size of the original loopless problem into an easier and equivalent MILP problem. The pre-processing step employs a fast matrix sparsification algorithm-Fast- sparse null-space pursuit (SNP)-inspired by recent results on SNP. By finding a reduced feasible 'loop-law' matrix subject to known directionalities, Fast-SNP considerably improves the computational efficiency in several metabolic models running different loopless optimization problems. Furthermore, analysis of the topology encoded in the reduced loop matrix enabled identification of key directional constraints for the potential permanent elimination of infeasible loops in the underlying model. Overall, Fast-SNP is an effective and simple algorithm for efficient formulation of loop-law constraints, making loopless flux optimization feasible and numerically tractable at large scale.<h4>Availability and implementation</h4>Source code for MATLAB including examples is freely available for download at http://www.aibn.uq.edu.au/cssb-resources under Software.

27456943,Current Trends of Lung Cancer Surgery and Demographic and Social Factors Related to Changes in the Trends of Lung Cancer Surgery: An Analysis of the National Database from 2010 to 2014.,"<h4>Purpose</h4>We investigated current trends in lung cancer surgery and identified demographic and social factors related to changes in these trends.<h4>Materials and methods</h4>We estimated the incidence of lung cancer surgery using a procedure code-based approach provided by the Health Insurance Review and Assessment Service (http://opendata.hira.or.kr). The population data were obtained every year from 2010 to 2014 from the Korean Statistical Information Service (http://kosis.kr/). The annual percent change (APC) and statistical significance were calculated using the Joinpoint software.<h4>Results</h4>From January 2010 to December 2014, 25,687 patients underwent 25,921 lung cancer surgeries, which increased by 45.1% from 2010 to 2014. The crude incidence rate of lung cancer surgery in each year increased significantly (APC, 9.5; p < 0.05). The male-to-female ratio decreased from 2.1 to 1.6 (APC, -6.3; p < 0.05). The incidence increased in the age group of = 70 years for both sexes (male: APC, 3.7; p < 0.05; female: APC, 5.96; p < 0.05). Furthermore, the proportion of female patients aged = 65 years increased (APC, 7.2; p < 0.05), while that of male patients aged < 65 years decreased (APC, -3.9; p < 0.05). The proportions of segmentectomies (APC, 17.8; p < 0.05) and lobectomies (APC, 7.5; p < 0.05) increased, while the proportion of pneumonectomies decreased (APC, -6.3; p < 0.05). Finally, the proportion of patients undergoing surgery in Seoul increased (APC, 1.1; p < 0.05), while the proportion in other areas decreased (APC, -1.5; p < 0.05).<h4>Conclusion</h4>An increase in the use of lung cancer surgery in elderly patients and female patients, and a decrease in the proportion of patients requiring extensive pulmonary resection were identified. Furthermore, centralization of lung cancer surgery was noted.",0,
21798033,Visualizing meta-features in proteomic maps.,"<h4>Background</h4>The steps of a high-throughput proteomics experiment include the separation, differential expression and mass spectrometry-based identification of proteins. However, the last and more challenging step is inferring the biological role of the identified proteins through their association with interaction networks, biological pathways, analysis of the effect of post-translational modifications, and other protein-related information.<h4>Results</h4>In this paper, we present an integrative visualization methodology that allows combining experimentally produced proteomic features with protein meta-features, typically coming from meta-analysis tools and databases, in synthetic Proteomic Feature Maps. Using three proteomics analysis scenarios, we show that the proposed visualization approach is effective in filtering, navigating and interacting with the proteomics data in order to address visually challenging biological questions. The novelty of our approach lies in the ease of integration of any user-defined proteomic features in easy-to-comprehend visual representations that resemble the familiar 2D-gel images, and can be adapted to the user's needs. The main capabilities of the developed VIP software, which implements the presented visualization methodology, are also highlighted and discussed.<h4>Conclusions</h4>By using this visualization and the associated VIP software, researchers can explore a complex heterogeneous proteomics dataset from different perspectives in order to address visually important biological queries and formulate new hypotheses for further investigation.

22659403,Determining pair distance distribution function from SAXS data using parametric functionals.,"Small angle X-ray scattering (SAXS) experiments are widely applied in structural biology. The SAXS experiments yield one-dimensional profile that needs further analysis to reveal structural information. The pair distance distribution function (PDDF), P(r), can provide molecular structures more intuitively, and it can be used to guide ab initio model reconstructions, making it a critical step to derive P(r) from experimental SAXS profiles. To calculate the P(r) curves, a new method based on a specially designed parametric functional form is developed, and implemented in pregxs. This method is tested against both synthetic and experimental data, the estimated P(r) functions are in good agreement with correct or known P(r). The method can also predict the molecular size. In summary, the pregxs method is robust and accurate in P(r) determination from SAXS profiles. The pregxs source code and an online server are available at http://www.sastbx.als.lbl.gov.",0,

24428888,OncomiRdbB: a comprehensive database of microRNAs and their targets in breast cancer.,"<h4>Background</h4>Given the estimate that 30% of our genes are controlled by microRNAs, it is essential that we understand the precise relationship between microRNAs and their targets. OncomiRs are microRNAs (miRNAs) that have been frequently shown to be deregulated in cancer. However, although several oncomiRs have been identified and characterized, there is as yet no comprehensive compilation of this data which has rendered it underutilized by cancer biologists. There is therefore an unmet need in generating bioinformatic platforms to speed the identification of novel therapeutic targets.<h4>Description</h4>We describe here OncomiRdbB, a comprehensive database of oncomiRs mined from different existing databases for mouse and humans along with novel oncomiRs that we have validated in human breast cancer samples. The database also lists their respective predicted targets, identified using miRanda, along with their IDs, sequences, chromosome location and detailed description. This database facilitates querying by search strings including microRNA name, sequence, accession number, target genes and organisms. The microRNA networks and their hubs with respective targets at 3'UTR, 5'UTR and exons of different pathway genes were also deciphered using the 'R' algorithm.<h4>Conclusion</h4>OncomiRdbB is a comprehensive and integrated database of oncomiRs and their targets in breast cancer with multiple query options which will help enhance both understanding of the biology of breast cancer and the development of new and innovative microRNA based diagnostic tools and targets of therapeutic significance.

32130122,Feasibility of an Electronic Health Tool to Promote Physical Activity in Primary Care: Pilot Cluster Randomized Controlled Trial.,"BACKGROUND:Physical inactivity is associated with increased health risks. Primary care providers (PCPs) are well positioned to support increased physical activity (PA) levels through screening and provision of PA prescriptions. However, PCP counseling on PA is not common. OBJECTIVE:This study aimed to assess the feasibility of implementing an electronic health (eHealth) tool to support PA counseling by PCPs and estimate intervention effectiveness on patients' PA levels. METHODS:A pragmatic pilot study was conducted using a stepped wedge cluster randomized trial design. The study was conducted at a single primary care clinic, with 4 pre-existing PCP teams. Adult patients who had a periodic health review (PHR) scheduled during the study period were invited to participate. The eHealth tool involved an electronic survey sent to participants before their PHR via an email or a tablet; data were used to automatically produce tailored resources and a PA prescription in the electronic medical record of participants in the intervention arm. Participants assigned to the control arm received usual care from their PCP. Feasibility was assessed by the proportion of completed surveys and patient-reported acceptability and fidelity measures. The primary effectiveness outcome was patient-reported PA at 4 months post-PHR, measured as metabolic equivalent of task (MET) minutes per week. Secondary outcomes assessed determinants of PA, including self-efficacy and intention to change based on the Health Action Process Approach behavior change theory. RESULTS:A total of 1028 patients receiving care from 34 PCPs were invited to participate and 530 (51.55%) consented (intervention [n=296] and control [n=234]). Of the participants who completed a process evaluation, almost half (88/178, 49.4%) stated they received a PA prescription, with only 42 receiving the full intervention including tailored resources from their PCP. A cluster-level linear regression analysis yielded a non-statistically significant positive difference in MET-minutes reported per week at follow-up between intervention and control conditions (mean difference 1027; 95% CI -155 to 2209; P=.09). No statistically significant differences were observed for secondary outcomes. CONCLUSIONS:Our results suggest that it is feasible to build an eHealth tool that screens and provides tailored resources for PA in a primary care setting but suboptimal intervention fidelity suggests greater work must be done to address PCP barriers to resource distribution. Participant responses to the primary effectiveness outcome (MET-minutes) were highly variable, reflecting a need for more robust measures of PA in future trials to address limitations in patient-reported data.

24558441,Human transporter database: comprehensive knowledge and discovery tools in the human transporter genes.,"Transporters are essential in homeostatic exchange of endogenous and exogenous substances at the systematic, organic, cellular, and subcellular levels. Gene mutations of transporters are often related to pharmacogenetics traits. Recent developments in high throughput technologies on genomics, transcriptomics and proteomics allow in depth studies of transporter genes in normal cellular processes and diverse disease conditions. The flood of high throughput data have resulted in urgent need for an updated knowledgebase with curated, organized, and annotated human transporters in an easily accessible way. Using a pipeline with the combination of automated keywords query, sequence similarity search and manual curation on transporters, we collected 1,555 human non-redundant transporter genes to develop the Human Transporter Database (HTD) (http://htd.cbi.pku.edu.cn). Based on the extensive annotations, global properties of the transporter genes were illustrated, such as expression patterns and polymorphisms in relationships with their ligands. We noted that the human transporters were enriched in many fundamental biological processes such as oxidative phosphorylation and cardiac muscle contraction, and significantly associated with Mendelian and complex diseases such as epilepsy and sudden infant death syndrome. Overall, HTD provides a well-organized interface to facilitate research communities to search detailed molecular and genetic information of transporters for development of personalized medicine.",1,
33381851,Dementia key gene identification with multi-layered SNP-gene-disease network.,"<h4>Motivation</h4>Recently, various approaches for diagnosing and treating dementia have received significant attention, especially in identifying key genes that are crucial for dementia. If the mutations of such key genes could be tracked, it would be possible to predict the time of onset of dementia and significantly aid in developing drugs to treat dementia. However, gene finding involves tremendous cost, time and effort. To alleviate these problems, research on utilizing computational biology to decrease the search space of candidate genes is actively conducted.In this study, we propose a framework in which diseases, genes and single-nucleotide polymorphisms are represented by a layered network, and key genes are predicted by a machine learning algorithm. The algorithm utilizes a network-based semi-supervised learning model that can be applied to layered data structures.<h4>Results</h4>The proposed method was applied to a dataset extracted from public databases related to diseases and genes with data collected from 186 patients. A portion of key genes obtained using the proposed method was verified in silico through PubMed literature, and the remaining genes were left as possible candidate genes.<h4>Availability and implementation</h4>The code for the framework will be available at http://www.alphaminers.net/.<h4>Supplementary information</h4>Supplementary data are available at Bioinformatics online.",0,

Today, however, the focus lies on the development of nonanimal testing approaches (i.e., in vitro and in chemico assays) and computational models. In this work, we investigate, based on publicly available LLNA data, the ability of aggregated, Mondrian conformal prediction classifiers to differentiate between non- sensitizing and sensitizing compounds as well as between two levels of skin sensitization potential (weak to moderate sensitizers, and strong to extreme sensitizers). The advantage of the conformal prediction framework over other modeling approaches is that it assigns compounds to activity classes only if a defined minimum level of confidence is reached for the individual predictions. This eliminates the need for applicability domain criteria that often are arbitrary in their nature and less flexible. Our new binary classifier, named Skin Doctor CP, differentiates nonsensitizers from sensitizers with a higher reliability-to-efficiency ratio than the corresponding nonconformal prediction workflow that we presented earlier. When tested on a set of 257 compounds at the significance levels of 0.10 and 0.30, the model reached an efficiency of 0.49 and 0.92, and an accuracy of 0.83 and 0.75, respectively. In addition, we developed a ternary classification workflow to differentiate nonsensitizers, weak to moderate sensitizers, and strong to extreme sensitizers. Although this model achieved satisfactory overall performance (accuracies of 0.90 and 0.73, and efficiencies of 0.42 and 0.90, at significance levels 0.10 and 0.30, respectively), it did not obtain satisfying class-wise results (at a significance level of 0.30, the validities obtained for nonsensitizers, weak to moderate sensitizers, and strong to extreme sensitizers were 0.70, 0.58, and 0.63, respectively). We argue that the model is, in consequence, unable to reliably identify strong to extreme sensitizers and suggest that other ternary models derived from the currently accessible LLNA data might suffer from the same problem. Skin Doctor CP is available via a public web service at https://nerdd.zbh.uni-hamburg.de/skinDoctorII/.",0,
21569303,Meta-analysis of heterogeneous Down Syndrome data reveals consistent genome-wide dosage effects related to neurological processes.,"<h4>Background</h4>Down syndrome (DS; trisomy 21) is the most common genetic cause of mental retardation in the human population and key molecular networks dysregulated in DS are still unknown. Many different experimental techniques have been applied to analyse the effects of dosage imbalance at the molecular and phenotypical level, however, currently no integrative approach exists that attempts to extract the common information.<h4>Results</h4>We have performed a statistical meta-analysis from 45 heterogeneous publicly available DS data sets in order to identify consistent dosage effects from these studies. We identified 324 genes with significant genome-wide dosage effects, including well investigated genes like SOD1, APP, RUNX1 and DYRK1A as well as a large proportion of novel genes (N = 62). Furthermore, we characterized these genes using gene ontology, molecular interactions and promoter sequence analysis. In order to judge relevance of the 324 genes for more general cerebral pathologies we used independent publicly available microarry data from brain studies not related with DS and identified a subset of 79 genes with potential impact for neurocognitive processes. All results have been made available through a web server under http://ds-geneminer.molgen.mpg.de/.<h4>Conclusions</h4>Our study represents a comprehensive integrative analysis of heterogeneous data including genome-wide transcript levels in the domain of trisomy 21. The detected dosage effects build a resource for further studies of DS pathology and the development of new therapies.",1,
26043787,Detection and analysis of disease-associated single nucleotide polymorphism influencing post-translational modification.,"Post-translational modification (PTM) plays a crucial role in biological functions and corresponding disease developments. Discovering disease-associated non-synonymous SNPs (nsSNPs) altering PTM sites can help to estimate the various PTM candidates involved in diseases, therefore, an integrated analysis between SNPs, PTMs and diseases is necessary. However, only a few types of PTMs affected by nsSNPs have been studied without considering disease-association until now. In this study, we developed a new database called PTM-SNP which contains a comprehensive collection of human nsSNPs that affect PTM sites, together with disease information. Total 179,325 PTM-SNPs were collected by aligning missense SNPs and stop-gain SNPs on PTM sites (position 0) or their flanking region (position -7 to 7). Disease-associated SNPs from GWAS catalogs were also matched with detected PTM-SNP to find disease associated PTM-SNPs. Our result shows PTM-SNPs are highly associated with diseases, compared with other nsSNP sites and functional classes including near gene, intron and so on. PTM-SNP can provide an insight about discovering important PTMs involved in the diseases easily through the web site. PTM-SNP is freely available at http://gcode.kaist.ac.kr/ptmsnp.",1,

30715274,APID database: redefining protein-protein interaction experimental evidences and binary interactomes.,"The collection and integration of all the known protein-protein physical interactions within a proteome framework are critical to allow proper exploration of the protein interaction networks that drive biological processes in cells at molecular level. APID Interactomes is a public resource of biological data (http://apid.dep.usal.es) that provides a comprehensive and curated collection of `protein interactomes' for more than 1100 organisms, including 30 species with more than 500 interactions, derived from the integration of experimentally detected protein-to-protein physical interactions (PPIs). We have performed an update of APID database including a redefinition of several key properties of the PPIs to provide a more precise data integration and to avoid false duplicated records. This includes the unification of all the PPIs from five primary databases of molecular interactions (BioGRID, DIP, HPRD, IntAct and MINT), plus the information from two original systematic sources of human data and from experimentally resolved 3D structures (i.e. PDBs, Protein Data Bank files, where more than two distinct proteins have been identified). Thus, APID provides PPIs reported in published research articles (with traceable PMIDs) and detected by valid experimental interaction methods that give evidences about such protein interactions (following the `ontology and controlled vocabulary': www.ebi.ac.uk/ols/ontologies/mi; developed by `HUPO PSI-MI'). Within this data mining framework, all interaction detection methods have been grouped into two main types: (i) `binary' physical direct detection methods and (ii) `indirect' methods. As a result of these redefinitions, APID provides unified protein interactomes including the specific `experimental evidences' that support each PPI, indicating whether the interactions can be considered `binary' (i.e. supported by at least one binary detection method) or not.",1,

27164621,Prioritizing Chemicals for Risk Assessment Using Chemoinformatics: Examples from the IARC Monographs on Pesticides.,"<h4>Background</h4>Identifying cancer hazards is the first step towards cancer prevention. The International Agency for Research on Cancer (IARC) Monographs Programme, which has evaluated nearly 1,000 agents for their carcinogenic potential since 1971, typically selects agents for hazard identification on the basis of public nominations, expert advice, published data on carcinogenicity, and public health importance.<h4>Objectives</h4>Here, we present a novel and complementary strategy for identifying agents for hazard evaluation using chemoinformatics, database integration, and automated text mining.<h4>Discussion</h4>To inform selection among a broad range of pesticides nominated for evaluation, we identified and screened nearly 6,000 relevant chemical structures, after which we systematically compiled information on 980 pesticides, creating network maps that allowed cluster visualization by chemical similarity, pesticide class, and publicly available information concerning cancer epidemiology, cancer bioassays, and carcinogenic mechanisms. For the IARC Monograph meetings that took place in March and June 2015, this approach supported high-priority evaluation of glyphosate, malathion, parathion, tetrachlorvinphos, diazinon, p,p'-dichlorodiphenyltrichloroethane (DDT), lindane, and 2,4-dichlorophenoxyacetic acid (2,4-D).<h4>Conclusions</h4>This systematic approach, accounting for chemical similarity and overlaying multiple data sources, can be used by risk assessors as well as by researchers to systematize, inform, and increase efficiency in selecting and prioritizing agents for hazard identification, risk assessment, regulation, or further investigation. This approach could be extended to an array of outcomes and agents, including occupational carcinogens, drugs, and foods. Citation: Guha N, Guyton KZ, Loomis D, Barupal DK. 2016.

31656094,"Genetic Susceptibility, Dietary Protein Intake, and Changes of Blood Pressure: The POUNDS Lost Trial.","High blood pressure (BP) is closely related to obesity, and weight loss lowers BP. Evidence has shown considerable interpersonal variation of changes in BP among people experiencing weight loss, and such variation might be partly determined by genetic factors. We assessed the changes in systolic and diastolic BP (SBP/DBP) among 692 participants randomly assigned to 1 of 4 diets varying in macronutrient content for 2 years. Two separate polygenic scores (SBP/DBP-PGS derived from 52/50 single nucleotide polymorphisms) were built for each participant based on 66 BP-associated single nucleotide polymorphisms. During a 2-year intervention, participants in the bottom versus upper tertile of SBP/DBP-PGS had a greater decrease in SBP (<U+25B3>SBP at 6, 12, and 24 months: -3.84 versus -1.61, -4.76 versus -2.75, -2.49 versus -1.63; <i>P</i>=0.001) or in DBP (<U+25B3>DBP at 6, 12, and 24 months: -3.09 versus -1.34, -2.69 versus -1.44, -1.82 versus -0.53; <i>P</i><0.001). We also found gene-diet interaction on changes in SBP from baseline to 24 months (<i>P</i><sub>interaction</sub>=0.009). Among participants assigned to a high-protein diet, those with a lower SBP-polygenic scores had greater decreases in SBP at months 6 (<i>P</i>=0.018), months 12 (<i>P</i>=0.007), and months 24 (<i>P</i>=0.089); while no significant difference was observed across the SBP-polygenic scores tertile groups among those assigned to an average-protein diet (all <i>P</i> values >0.05). Our data indicate that genetic susceptibility may affect BP changes in response to weight-loss diet interventions, and protein intake may modify the genetic associations with changes in BP.

21546392,Boulder ALignment Editor (ALE): a web-based RNA alignment tool.,"<h4>Summary</h4>The explosion of interest in non-coding RNAs, together with improvements in RNA X-ray crystallography, has led to a rapid increase in RNA structures at atomic resolution from 847 in 2005 to 1900 in 2010. The success of whole-genome sequencing has led to an explosive growth of unaligned homologous sequences. Consequently, there is a compelling and urgent need for user-friendly tools for producing structure-informed RNA alignments. Most alignment software considers the primary sequence alone; some specialized alignment software can also include Watson-Crick base pairs, but none adequately addresses the needs introduced by the rapid influx of both sequence and structural data. Therefore, we have developed the Boulder ALignment Editor (ALE), which is a web-based RNA alignment editor, designed for editing and assessing alignments using structural information. Some features of BoulderALE include the annotation and evaluation of an alignment based on isostericity of Watson-Crick and non-Watson-Crick base pairs, along with the collapsing (horizontally and vertically) of the alignment, while maintaining the ability to edit the alignment.<h4>Availability</h4>http://www.microbio.me/boulderale.",0,

27976886,MIB: Metal Ion-Binding Site Prediction and Docking Server.,"The structure of a protein determines its biological function(s) and its interactions with other factors; the binding regions tend to be conserved in sequence and structure, and the interacting residues involved are usually in close 3D space. The Protein Data Bank currently contains more than 110†000 protein structures, approximately one-third of which contain metal ions. Identifying and characterizing metal ion-binding sites is thus essential for investigating a protein's function(s) and interactions. However, experimental approaches are time-consuming and costly. The web server reported here was built to predict metal ion-binding residues and to generate the predicted metal ion-bound 3D structure. Binding templates have been constructed for regions that bind 12 types of metal ion-binding residues have been used to construct binding templates. The templates include residues within 3.5 ≈ of the metal ion, and the fragment transformation method was used for structural comparison between query proteins and templates without any data training. Through the adjustment of scoring functions, which are based on the similarity of structure and binding residues.

This study aimed to investigate effects of clinical and sociodemographic variables on the classification by applying multivariate pattern analysis (MVPA) to both gray matter (GM) volume and FC measures in patients with SZ and healthy controls (HC). RS and structural magnetic resonance imaging data (sMRI) from 74 HC and 71 SZ patients were obtained from a Mind Research Network COBRE dataset available via COINS (http://coins.mrn.org/dx). We used a MVPA framework using support-vector machines embedded in a repeated, nested cross-validation to generate a multi-modal diagnostic system and evaluate its generalizability. The dependence of neurodiagnostic performance on clinical and sociodemographic variables was evaluated. The RS classifier showed a slightly higher accuracy (70.5%) compared to the structural classifier (69.7%). The combination of sMRI and RS outperformed single MRI modalities classification by reaching 75% accuracy. The RS based moderator analysis revealed that the neurodiagnostic performance was driven by older SZ patients with an earlier illness onset and more pronounced negative symptoms. In contrast, there was no linear relationship between the clinical variables and neuroanatomically derived group membership measures. This study achieved higher accuracy distinguishing HC from SZ patients by fusing 2 imaging modalities. In addition the results of RS based moderator analysis showed that age of patients, as well as their age at the illness onset were the most important clinical features.",0,
26226130,Node sampling for protein complex estimation in bait-prey graphs.,"In cellular biology, node-and-edge graph or ""network"" data collection often uses bait-prey technologies such as co-immunoprecipitation (CoIP). Bait-prey technologies assay relationships or ""interactions"" between protein pairs, with CoIP specifically measuring protein complex co-membership. Analyses of CoIP data frequently focus on estimating protein complex membership. Due to budgetary and other constraints, exhaustive assay of the entire network using CoIP is not always possible. We describe a stratified sampling scheme to select baits for CoIP experiments when protein complex estimation is the main goal. Expanding upon the classic framework in which nodes represent proteins and edges represent pairwise interactions, we define generalized nodes as sets of adjacent nodes with identical adjacency outside the set and use these as strata from which to select the next set of baits. Strata are redefined at each round of sampling to incorporate accumulating data. This scheme maintains user-specified quality thresholds for protein complex estimates and, relative to simple random sampling, leads to a marked increase in the number of correctly estimated complexes at each round of sampling.

The specimens were radiographed using a charge-coupled device sensor along with an 11-step aluminum step wedge (1.5-mm incremental steps) and 1-mm-thick tooth cut using five tube voltage/exposure time setups (60 kVp, 0.10/0.08 seconds; 70 kVp, 0.10/0.08/0.06 seconds) at 4 mA and 30 cm. The radiopacity of the specimens was compared with that of the aluminum step wedge and human enamel and dentin using NIH ImageJ software (available at http://rsb.info.nih.gov/ij/). A linear regression model for the aluminum step wedge was constructed, and the data were analyzed by ANOVA and Duncan post hoc test.<h4>Results</h4>Maxcem Elite (5.142 to 5.441) showed the highest radiopacity of all materials, followed in order by Multilink Speed (3.731 to 3.396) and V-link (2.763 to 3.103). The radiopacity of Panavia F 2.0 (2.025 to 2.429), BisCem (1.825 to 2.218), Clearfil SA Luting (1.692 to 2.145), Duolink (1.707 to 1.993), and RelyX Unicem Clicker (1.586 to 1.979) were between enamel (2.117 to 2.330) and dentin (1.302 to 1.685). The radiopacity of 70 kVp conditions was higher than that of the 60 kVp conditions.<h4>Conclusions</h4>The radiopacities of the tested luting materials were greater than those of dentin or aluminum, satisfying the criteria of the International Organization for Standardization, and they differed significantly from each other in the exposure setups.",0,

This study describes a method PEPstrMOD, which is an updated version of PEPstr, developed specifically for predicting the structure of peptides containing natural and non-natural/modified residues.<h4>Results</h4>PEPstrMOD integrates Forcefield_NCAA and Forcefield_PTM force field libraries to handle 147 non-natural residues and 32 types of post-translational modifications respectively by performing molecular dynamics using AMBER. AMBER was also used to handle other modifications like peptide cyclization, use of D-amino acids and capping of terminal residues. In addition, GROMACS was used to implement 210 non-natural side-chains in peptides using SwissSideChain force field library. We evaluated the performance of PEPstrMOD on three datasets generated from Protein Data Bank; i) ModPep dataset contains 501 non-natural peptides, ii) ModPep16, a subset of ModPep, and iii) CyclicPep contains 34 cyclic peptides. We achieved backbone Root Mean Square Deviation between the actual and predicted structure of peptides in the range of 3.81-4.05 ≈.<h4>Conclusions</h4>In summary, the method PEPstrMOD has been developed that predicts the structure of modified peptide from the sequence/structure given as input. We validated the PEPstrMOD application using a dataset of peptides having non-natural/modified residues. PEPstrMOD offers unique advantages that allow the users to predict the structures of peptides having i) natural residues, ii) non-naturally modified residues, iii) terminal modifications, iv) post-translational modifications, v) D-amino acids, and also allows extended simulation of predicted peptides.

27597880,Functional networks inference from rule-based machine learning models.,"<h4>Background</h4>Functional networks play an important role in the analysis of biological processes and systems. The inference of these networks from high-throughput (-omics) data is an area of intense research. So far, the similarity-based inference paradigm (e.g. gene co-expression) has been the most popular approach. It assumes a functional relationship between genes which are expressed at similar levels across different samples. An alternative to this paradigm is the inference of relationships from the structure of machine learning models. These models are able to capture complex relationships between variables, that often are different/complementary to the similarity-based methods.<h4>Results</h4>We propose a protocol to infer functional networks from machine learning models, called FuNeL. It assumes, that genes used together within a rule-based machine learning model to classify the samples, might also be functionally related at a biological level. The protocol is first tested on synthetic datasets and then evaluated on a test suite of 8 real-world datasets related to human cancer. The networks inferred from the real-world data are compared against gene co-expression networks of equal size, generated with 3 different methods. The comparison is performed from two different points of view. We analyse the enriched biological terms in the set of network nodes and the relationships between known disease-associated genes in a context of the network topology. The comparison confirms both the biological relevance and the complementary character of the knowledge captured by the FuNeL networks in relation to similarity-based methods and demonstrates its potential to identify known disease associations as core elements of the network.

The most widely used organism for these studies is the free-living flatworm Schmidtea mediterranea. In 2007, the Schmidtea mediterranea Genome Database (SmedGD) was first released to provide a much needed resource for the small, but growing planarian community. SmedGD 1.0 has been a depository for genome sequence, a draft assembly, and related experimental data (e.g., RNAi phenotypes, in situ hybridization images, and differential gene expression results). We report here a comprehensive update to SmedGD (SmedGD 2.0) that aims to expand its role as an interactive community resource. The new database includes more recent, and up-to-date transcription data, provides tools that enhance interconnectivity between different genome assemblies and transcriptomes, including next-generation assemblies for both the sexual and asexual biotypes of S. mediterranea. SmedGD 2.0 (http://smedgd.stowers.org) not only provides significantly improved gene annotations, but also tools for data sharing, attributes that will help both the planarian and biomedical communities to more efficiently mine the genomics and transcriptomics of S. mediterranea.",1,
22759420,Comparative evaluation of set-level techniques in predictive classification of gene expression samples.,"<h4>Background</h4>Analysis of gene expression data in terms of a priori-defined gene sets has recently received significant attention as this approach typically yields more compact and interpretable results than those produced by traditional methods that rely on individual genes. The set-level strategy can also be adopted with similar benefits in predictive classification tasks accomplished with machine learning algorithms. Initial studies into the predictive performance of set-level classifiers have yielded rather controversial results. The goal of this study is to provide a more conclusive evaluation by testing various components of the set-level framework within a large collection of machine learning experiments.<h4>Results</h4>Genuine curated gene sets constitute better features for classification than sets assembled without biological relevance. For identifying the best gene sets for classification, the Global test outperforms the gene-set methods GSEA and SAM-GS as well as two generic feature selection methods. To aggregate expressions of genes into a feature value, the singular value decomposition (SVD) method as well as the SetSig technique improve on simple arithmetic averaging. Set-level classifiers learned with 10 features constituted by the Global test slightly outperform baseline gene-level classifiers learned with all original data features although they are slightly less accurate than gene-level classifiers learned with a prior feature-selection step.<h4>Conclusion</h4>Set-level classifiers do not boost predictive accuracy, however, they do achieve competitive accuracy if learned with the right combination of ingredients.<h4>Availability</h4>Open-source, publicly available software was used for classifier learning and testing. The gene expression datasets and the gene set database used are also publicly available. The full tabulation of experimental results is available at http://ida.felk.cvut.cz/CESLT.",1,

26106259,MITOSCISSOR: A Useful Tool for Auto-Assembly of Mitogenomic Datasets in the Evolutionary Analysis of Fishes.,"As a result of the development of rapid and efficient sequencing technologies, complete sequences of numerous mitochondrial genomes are now available. Mitochondrial genomes have been widely used to evaluate relationships between species in several fields, including evolutionary and population genetics, as well as in forensic identification and in the study of mitochondrial diseases in humans. However, the creation of mitochondrial genomes is extremely time consuming. In this paper, we present a new tool, MITOSCISSOR, which is a rapid method for parsing and formatting dozens of complete mitochondrial genome sequences. With the aid of MITOSCISSOR, complete mitochondrial genome sequences of 103 species from Tetraodontiformes (a difficult-to-classify order of fish) were easily parsed and formatted. It typically takes several days to produce similar results when relying upon manual editing. This tool could open the .gb file of Genbank directly and help us to use existing mitogenomic data. In the present study, we established the first clear and robust molecular phylogeny of 103 tetraodontiform fishes, a goal that has long eluded ichthyologists. MITOSCISSOR greatly increases the efficiency with which DNA data files can be parsed and annotated, and thus has the potential to greatly facilitate evolutionary analysis using mitogenomic data.

33900211,"Effect of Diameter and Number of Hepatocellular Carcinomas on Survival After Resection, Transarterial Chemoembolization, and Ablation.","<h4>Introduction</h4>Most studies predicting survival after resection, transarterial chemoembolization (TACE), and ablation analyzed diameter and number of hepatocellular carcinomas (HCCs) as dichotomous variables, resulting in an underestimation of risk variation. We aimed to develop and validate a new prognostic model for patients with HCC using largest diameter and number of HCCs as continuous variables.<h4>Methods</h4>The prognostic model was developed using data from patients undergoing resection, TACE, and ablation in 645 Japanese institutions. The model results were shown after balanced using the inverse probability of treatment-weighted analysis and were externally validated in an international multi-institution cohort.<h4>Results</h4>Of 77,268 patients, 43,904 patients, including 15,313 (34.9%) undergoing liver resection, 13,375 (30.5%) undergoing TACE, and 15,216 (34.7%) undergoing ablation, met the inclusion criteria. Our model (http://www.u-tokyo-hbp-transplant-surgery.jp/about/calculation.html) showed that the 5-year overall survival (OS) in patients with HCC undergoing these procedures decreased with progressive incremental increases in diameter and number of HCCs. For patients undergoing resection, the inverse probability of treatment-weighted-adjusted 5-year OS probabilities were 10%-20% higher compared with patients undergoing TACE for 1-6 HCC lesions <10 cm and were also 10%-20% higher compared with patients undergoing ablation when the HCC diameter was 2-3 cm. For patients undergoing resection and TACE, the model performed well in the external cohort.<h4>Discussion</h4>Our novel prognostic model performed well in predicting OS after resection and TACE for HCC and demonstrated that resection may have a survival benefit over TACE and ablation based on the diameter and number of HCCs.",0,
22915736,Plant B vitamin pathways and their compartmentation: a guide for the perplexed.,"The B vitamins and the cofactors derived from them are essential for life. B vitamin synthesis in plants is consequently as crucial to plants themselves as it is to humans and animals, whose B vitamin nutrition depends largely on plants. The synthesis and salvage pathways for the seven plant B vitamins are now broadly known, but certain enzymes and many transporters have yet to be identified, and the subcellular locations of various reactions are unclear. Although very substantial, what is not known about plant B vitamin pathways is regrettably difficult to discern from the literature or from biochemical pathway databases. Nor do databases accurately represent all that is known about B vitamin pathways-above all their compartmentation-because the facts are scattered throughout the literature, and thus hard to piece together. These problems (i) deter discoveries because newcomers to B vitamins cannot see which mysteries still need solving; and (ii) impede metabolic reconstruction and modelling of B vitamin pathways because genes for reactions or transport steps are missing. This review therefore takes a fresh approach to capture current knowledge of B vitamin pathways in plants. The synthesis pathways, key salvage routes, and their subcellular compartmentation are surveyed in depth, and encoded in the SEED database (http://pubseed.theseed.org/seedviewer.cgi?page=PlantGateway) for Arabidopsis and maize. The review itself and the encoded pathways specifically identify enigmatic or missing reactions, enzymes, and transporters. The SEED-encoded B vitamin pathway collection is a publicly available, expertly curated, one-stop resource for metabolic reconstruction and modeling.",0,
33761699,Increased bleeding events with the addition of apixaban to the dual anti-platelet regimen for the treatment of patients with acute coronary syndrome: A meta-analysis.,"<h4>Background</h4>Dual anti-platelet therapy (DAPT) with aspirin and clopidogrel has been the mainstay of treatment for patients with acute coronary syndrome (ACS). However, the recurrence of thrombotic events, potential aspirin and clopidogrel hypo-responsiveness, and other limitations of DAPT have led to the development of newer oral anti-thrombotic drugs. Apixaban, a new non-vitamin K antagonist, has been approved for use. In this meta-analysis, we aimed to compare the bleeding outcomes observed with the addition of apixaban to DAPT for the treatment of patients with ACS.<h4>Methods</h4>Online databases including EMBASE, Cochrane Central, http://www.ClinicalTrials.gov, MEDLINE and Web of Science were searched for English based publications comparing the use of apixaban added to DAPT for the treatment of patients with ACS. Different categories of bleeding events and cardiovascular outcomes were assessed. The analysis was carried out by the RevMan software version 5.4. Odds ratios (OR) with 95% confidence intervals (CI) were used to represent the data following analysis.<h4>Results</h4>This research analysis consisted of 4 trials with a total number of 9010 participants. Thrombolysis in myocardial infarction (TIMI) defined major bleeding (OR: 2.45, 95% CI: 1.45-4.12; P = .0008), TIMI defined minor bleeding (OR: 3.12, 95% CI: 1.71-5.70; P = .0002), International society of thrombosis and hemostasis (ISTH) major bleeding (OR: 2.49, 95% CI: 1.80-3.45; P = .00001) and Global Use of Strategies to Open Occluded Arteries (GUSTO) defined severe bleeding (OR: 3.00, 95% CI: 1.56-5.78; P = .01) were significantly increased with the addition of apixaban to DAPT versus DAPT alone in these patients with ACS. However fatal bleeding (OR: 10.96, 95% CI: 0.61-198.3; P = .11) was not significantly different.<h4>Conclusions</h4>Addition of the novel oral anticoagulant apixaban to the DAPT regimen significantly increased bleeding and therefore did not show any beneficial effect in these patients with ACS. However, due to the extremely limited data, we apparently have to rely on future larger studies to confirm this hypothesis.",0,
27896026,jicbioimage: a tool for automated and reproducible bioimage analysis.,"There has been steady improvement in methods for capturing bioimages. However analysing these images still remains a challenge. The Python programming language provides a powerful and flexible environment for scientific computation. It has a wide range of supporting libraries for image processing but lacks native support for common bioimage formats, and requires specific code to be written to ensure that suitable audit trails are generated and analyses are reproducible. Here we describe the development of a Python tool that: (1) allows users to quickly view and explore microscopy data; (2) generate reproducible analyses, encoding a complete history of image transformations from raw data to final result; and (3) scale up analyses from initial exploration to high throughput processing pipelines, with a minimal amount of extra effort.

23626918,AnsNGS: An Annotation System to Sequence Variations of Next Generation Sequencing Data for Disease-Related Phenotypes.,"<h4>Objectives</h4>Next-generation sequencing (NGS) data in the identification of disease-causing genes provides a promising opportunity in the diagnosis of disease. Beyond the previous efforts for NGS data alignment, variant detection, and visualization, developing a comprehensive annotation system supported by multiple layers of disease phenotype-related databases is essential for deciphering the human genome. To satisfy the impending need to decipher the human genome, it is essential to develop a comprehensive annotation system supported by multiple layers of disease phenotype-related databases.<h4>Methods</h4>AnsNGS (Annotation system of sequence variations for next-generation sequencing data) is a tool for contextualizing variants related to diseases and examining their functional consequences. The AnsNGS integrates a variety of annotation databases to attain multiple levels of annotation.<h4>Results</h4>The AnsNGS assigns biological functions to variants, and provides gene (or disease)-centric queries for finding disease-causing variants. The AnsNGS also connects those genes harbouring variants and the corresponding expression probes for downstream analysis using expression microarrays. Here, we demonstrate its ability to identify disease-related variants in the human genome.<h4>Conclusions</h4>The AnsNGS can give a key insight into which of these variants is already known to be involved in a disease-related phenotype or located in or near a known regulatory site. The AnsNGS is available free of charge to academic users and can be obtained from http://snubi.org/software/AnsNGS/.",0,
32271149,Development and Modification of a Mobile Health Program to Promote Postpartum Weight Loss in Women at Elevated Risk for Cardiometabolic Disease: Single-Arm Pilot Study.,"BACKGROUND:Pregnancy complications in combination with postpartum weight retention lead to significant risks of cardiometabolic disease and obesity. The majority of traditional face-to-face interventions have not been effective in postpartum women. Mobile technology enables the active engagement of postpartum women to promote lifestyle changes to prevent chronic diseases. OBJECTIVE:We sought to employ an interactive, user-centered, and participatory method of development, evaluation, and iteration to design and optimize the mobile health (mHealth) Fit After Baby program. METHODS:For the initial development, a multidisciplinary team integrated evidence-based approaches for health behavior, diet and physical activity, and user-centered design and engagement. We implemented an iterative feedback and design process via 3 month-long beta pilots in which postpartum women with cardiometabolic risk factors participated in the program and provided weekly and ongoing feedback. We also conducted two group interviews using a structured interview guide to gather additional feedback. Qualitative data were recorded, transcribed, and analyzed using established qualitative methods. Modifications based on feedback were integrated into successive versions of the app. RESULTS:We conducted three pilot testing rounds with a total of 26 women. Feedback from each pilot cohort informed changes to the functionality and content of the app, and then a subsequent pilot group participated in the program. We optimized the program in response to feedback through three iterations leading to a final version. CONCLUSIONS:This study demonstrates the feasibility of using an interactive, user-centered, participatory method of rapid, iterative design and evaluation to develop and optimize a mHealth intervention program for postpartum women.

32647037,"An Analysis of Variability in ""CatWalk"" Locomotor Measurements to Aid Experimental Design and Interpretation.","Preclinical studies in models of neurologic injury and disease rely on behavioral outcomes to measure intervention efficacy. For spinal cord injury, the CatWalk system provides unbiased quantitative assessment of subtle aspects of locomotor function in rodents and so can powerfully detect significant differences between experimental and control groups. Although clearly of key importance, summary group-level data can obscure the variability within and between individual subjects and therefore make it difficult to understand the magnitude of effect in individual animals and the proportion of a group that may show benefit. Here, we calculate reference change intervals (RCIs) that define boundaries of normal variability for measures of rat locomotion on the CatWalk. Our results indicate that many commonly-used outcome measures are highly variable, such that differences of up to 70% from baseline value must be considered normal variation. Many CatWalk outcome variables are also highly correlated and dependent on run speed. Application of calculated RCIs to open access data (https://scicrunch.org/odc-sci) on hindlimb stride length in spinal cord-injured rats illustrates the complementarity between group-level (16 mm change; <i>p</i> = 0.0009) and individual-level (5/32 animals show change outside RCI boundaries) analysis between week 3 and week 6 after injury. We also conclude that interdependence among CatWalk variables implies that test ""batteries"" require careful composition to ensure that different aspects of defective gait are analyzed. Calculation of RCIs aids in experimental design by quantifying variability and enriches overall data analysis by providing details of change at an individual level that complement group-level analysis.",0,

RECOMMENDATION:There is insufficient evidence to support the superiority of either the middle fossa (MF) or the retrosigmoid (RS) approach for complete VS resection and FN preservation when serviceable hearing is present. QUESTION 2:Which surgical approach (RS or translabyrinthine [TL]) for VS is best for complete resection and FN preservation when serviceable hearing is not present? RECOMMENDATION:There is insufficient evidence to support the superiority of either the RS or the TL approach for complete VS resection and FN preservation when serviceable hearing is not present. QUESTION 3:Does VS size matter for facial and vestibulocochlear nerve preservation with surgical resection? RECOMMENDATION:Level 3: Patients with larger VS tumor size should be counseled about the greater than average risk of loss of serviceable hearing. QUESTION 4:Should small intracanalicular tumors (<1.5 cm) be surgically resected? RECOMMENDATION:There are insufficient data to support a firm recommendation that surgery be the primary treatment for this subclass of VSs. QUESTION 5:Is hearing preservation routinely possible with VS surgical resection when serviceable hearing is present? RECOMMENDATION:Level 3: Hearing preservation surgery via the MF or the RS approach may be attempted in patients with small tumor size (<1.5 cm) and good preoperative hearing. QUESTION 6:When should surgical resection be the initial treatment in patients with neurofibromatosis type 2 (NF2)? RECOMMENDATION:There is insufficient evidence that surgical resection should be the initial treatment in patients with NF2. QUESTION 7:Does a multidisciplinary team, consisting of neurosurgery and neurotology, provides the best outcomes of complete resection and facial/vestibulocochlear nerve preservation for patients undergoing resection of VSs? RECOMMENDATION:There is insufficient evidence to support stating that a multidisciplinary team, usually consisting of a neurosurgeon and a neurotologist, provides superior outcomes compared to either subspecialist working alone. QUESTION 8:Does a subtotal surgical resection of a VS followed by stereotactic radiosurgery (SRS) to the residual tumor provide comparable hearing and FN preservation to patients who undergo a complete surgical resection? RECOMMENDATION:There is insufficient evidence to support subtotal resection (STR) followed by SRS provides comparable hearing and FN preservation to patients who undergo a complete surgical resection. QUESTION 9:Does surgical resection of VS treat preoperative balance problems more effectively than SRS? RECOMMENDATION:There is insufficient evidence to support either surgical resection or SRS for treatment of preoperative balance problems. QUESTION 10:Does surgical resection of VS treat preoperative trigeminal neuralgia more effectively than SRS? RECOMMENDATION:Level 3: Surgical resection of VSs may be used to better relieve symptoms of trigeminal neuralgia than SRS. QUESTION 11:Is surgical resection of VSs more difficult (associated with higher facial neuropathies and STR rates) after initial treatment with SRS? RECOMMENDATION:Level 3: If microsurgical resection is necessary after SRS, it is recommended that patients be counseled that there is an increased likelihood of a STR and decreased FN function.

We report here the synthesis of Bi(4)O(4)S(3) at 500 ∞C by a vacuum encapsulation technique and its basic characterizations. The as-synthesized Bi(4)O(4)S(3) was contaminated with small amounts of Bi(2)S(3) and Bi impurities. The majority phase was found to be tetragonal (space group I4/mmm) with lattice parameters a = 3.9697(2) ≈ and c = 41.3520(1) ≈. Both AC and DC magnetization measurements confirmed that Bi(4)O(4)S(3) is a bulk superconductor with a superconducting transition temperature (T(c)) of 4.4 K. Isothermal magnetization (M-H) measurements indicated closed loops with clear signatures of flux pinning and irreversible behavior. The lower critical field (H(c1)) at 2 K for the new superconductor was found to be ~15 Oe. Magnetotransport measurements showed a broadening of the resistivity (<U+03C1>) and a decrease in T(c) (<U+03C1> = 0) with increasing magnetic field. The extrapolated upper critical field H(c2)(0) was ~31 kOe with a corresponding Ginzburg-Landau coherence length of ~100 ≈ . In the normal state, the <U+03C1> ~ T(2) dependence was not indicated. Hall resistivity data showed a nonlinear magnetic field dependence. Our magnetization and electrical transport measurements substantiate the appearance of bulk superconductivity in as-synthesized Bi(4)O(4)S(3). On the other hand, Bi heat-treated at the same temperature is not superconducting, thus excluding the possibility of impurity-driven superconductivity in the newly discovered superconductor Bi(4)O(4)S(3).",0,

This technical concern introduces biases that hamper any synthetic studies or comparison of genetic diversity between collections. To prevent this for Sorghum bicolor, we developed a control kit of 48 SSR markers.<h4>Methods and results</h4>One hundred seventeen markers were selected along the genome to provide coverage across the length of all 10 sorghum linkage groups. They were tested for polymorphism and reproducibility across two laboratories (Centre de Cooperation Internationale en Recherche Agronomique pour le Developpement [CIRAD], France, and International Crops Research Institute for the Semi-Arid Tropics [ICRISAT], India) using two commonly used genotyping technologies (polyacrylamide gel-based technology with LI-COR sequencing machines and capillary systems with ABI sequencing apparatus) with DNA samples from a diverse set of 48 S. bicolor accessions.<h4>Conclusions</h4>A kit for diversity analysis (http://sat.cirad.fr/sat/sorghum_SSR_kit/) was developed. It contains information on 48 technically robust sorghum microsatellite markers and 10 DNA controls. It can further be used to calibrate sorghum SSR genotyping data acquired with different technologies and compare those to genetic diversity references.",0,

PASS predicted biological activity profiles are used as independent input variables for QSAR modelling with SCR. QSAR models were developed using LD50 values for compounds tested on rats with four types of administration (oral, intravenous, intraperitoneal, subcutaneous). The proposed method was evaluated on the set of compounds tested for acute rat toxicity with oral administration (7286 compounds) used for testing the known QSAR methods in T.E.S.T. 3.0 program (U.S. EPA). The several other sets of compounds tested for acute rat toxicity by different routes of administration selected from SYMYX MDL Toxicity Database were used too. The method was compared with the results of prediction of acute rodent toxicity for noncongeneric sets obtained by ACD/Labs Inc. The test sets were predicted with regards to the applicability domain. Comparison of accuracy for QSAR models obtained separately using QNA descriptors, PASS predictions, nearest neighbours' assessment with consensus models clearly demonstrated the benefits of consensus prediction.

The aim of this project was to develop an open access risk assessment and cost-utility analysis web-tool for assessing HIV, HCV and HBV screening options (http://www.isbtweb.org/working-parties/transfusion-transmitted-infectious-diseases/). An analysis for six countries (Brazil, Ghana, the Netherlands, South Africa, Thailand and USA) was conducted.<h4>Materials and methods</h4>Four strategies; (1) antibody assays (Abs) for HIV and HCV + HBsAg, (2) antibody assays that include antigens for HIV and HCV (Combo) + HBsAg, (3) NAT in minipools of variable size (MP NAT) and (4) individual donation (ID) NAT can be evaluated using the tool. Country-specific data on donors, donation testing results, recipient outcomes and costs are entered using the online interface. Results obtained include the number infections interdicted using each screening options, and the (incremental and average) cost-utility of the options.<h4>Results</h4>In each of the six countries evaluated, the use of antibody assays is cost effective or even cost saving. NAT has varying cost-utility depending on the setting, and where adopted, the incremental cost-utility exceeds any previously defined or proposed threshold in each country.<h4>Conclusion</h4>The web-tool allows an assessment of infectious units interdicted and value for money of different testing strategies. Regardless of gross national income (GNI) per capita, countries appear willing to dedicate healthcare resources to blood supply safety in excess of that for other sectors of health care.",0,
27268407,Tracking medical genetic literature through machine learning.,"There has been remarkable progress in identifying the causes of genetic conditions as well as understanding how changes in specific genes cause disease. Though difficult (and often superficial) to parse, an interesting tension involves emphasis on basic research aimed to dissect normal and abnormal biology versus more clearly clinical and therapeutic investigations. To examine one facet of this question and to better understand progress in Mendelian-related research, we developed an algorithm that classifies medical literature into three categories (Basic, Clinical, and Management) and conducted a retrospective analysis. We built a supervised machine learning classification model using the Azure Machine Learning (ML) Platform and analyzed the literature (1970-2014) from NCBI's Entrez Gene2Pubmed Database (http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene) using genes from the NHGRI's Clinical Genomics Database (http://research.nhgri.nih.gov/CGD/).

The rate of Clinical publication was significantly higher than Basic or Management. The rate of publication of article types differed significantly when divided into key eras: Human Genome Project (HGP) planning phase (1984-1990); HGP launch (1990) to publication (2001); following HGP completion to the ""Next Generation"" advent (2009); the era following 2009.

Based on the Z-curve theory, we have developed a web-based system Ori-Finder to predict oriCs in bacterial genomes with high accuracy and reliability by taking advantage of comparative genomics, and the predicted oriC regions have been organized into an online database DoriC, which is publicly available at http://tubic.tju.edu.cn/doric/ since 2007. Five years after we constructed DoriC, the database has significant advances over the number of bacterial genomes, increasing about 4-fold. Additionally, oriC regions in archaeal genomes identified by in vivo experiments, as well as in silico analyses, have also been added to the database. Consequently, the latest release of DoriC contains oriCs for >1500 bacterial genomes and 81 archaeal genomes, respectively.",1,
31432427,Essential Features and Use Cases of the Cerebrospinal Fluid Proteome Resource (CSF-PR).,"Every year, a large number of published studies present biomarkers for various neurological disorders. Many of these studies are based on mass spectrometry proteomics data and describe comparison of the abundance of proteins in cerebrospinal fluid between two or more disease groups. As the number of such studies is growing, it is no longer straightforward to obtain an overview of which specific proteins are increased or decreased between the numerous relevant diseases and their many subcategories, or to see the larger picture or trends between related diseases. To alleviate this situation, we therefore mined the literature for mass spectrometry-based proteomics studies including quantitative protein data from cerebrospinal fluid of patients with multiple sclerosis, Alzheimer's disease, and Parkinson's disease and organized the extracted data in the Cerebrospinal Fluid Proteome Resource (CSF-PR). CSF-PR is freely available online at http://probe.uib.no/csf-pr , is highly interactive, and allows for easy navigation, visualization, and export of the published scientific data. This chapter will guide the user through some of the most important features of the tool and show examples of the suggested use cases.",1,
23181585,A Monte Carlo-based framework enhances the discovery and interpretation of regulatory sequence motifs.,"<h4>Background</h4>Discovery of functionally significant short, statistically overrepresented subsequence patterns (motifs) in a set of sequences is a challenging problem in bioinformatics. Oftentimes, not all sequences in the set contain a motif. These non-motif-containing sequences complicate the algorithmic discovery of motifs. Filtering the non-motif-containing sequences from the larger set of sequences while simultaneously determining the identity of the motif is, therefore, desirable and a non-trivial problem in motif discovery research.<h4>Results</h4>We describe MotifCatcher, a framework that extends the sensitivity of existing motif-finding tools by employing random sampling to effectively remove non-motif-containing sequences from the motif search. We developed two implementations of our algorithm; each built around a commonly used motif-finding tool, and applied our algorithm to three diverse chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) data sets. In each case, the motif finder with the MotifCatcher extension demonstrated improved sensitivity over the motif finder alone. Our approach organizes candidate functionally significant discovered motifs into a tree, which allowed us to make additional insights. In all cases, we were able to support our findings with experimental work from the literature.<h4>Conclusions</h4>Our framework demonstrates that additional processing at the sequence entry level can significantly improve the performance of existing motif-finding tools. For each biological data set tested, we were able to propose novel biological hypotheses supported by experimental work from the literature. Specifically, in Escherichia coli, we suggested binding site motifs for 6 non-traditional LexA protein binding sites; in Saccharomyces cerevisiae, we hypothesize 2 disparate mechanisms for novel binding sites of the Cse4p protein; and in Halobacterium sp. NRC-1, we discoverd subtle differences in a general transcription factor (GTF) binding site motif across several data sets. We suggest that small differences in our discovered motif could confer specificity for one or more homologous GTF proteins. We offer a free implementation of the MotifCatcher software package at http://www.bme.ucdavis.edu/facciotti/resources_data/software/.",0,
24206655,Association of a polymorphism in PON-1 gene with steroid-induced osteonecrosis of femoral head in Chinese Han population.,"<h4>Background</h4>Treatment with steroids covers a wide spectrum of diseases in clinic. However, some users are suffering from serious side effects of steroid administration, while we enjoy the benefit it brings about. Osteonecrosis of the femoral head (ONFH) is a troublesome one among them. Recent studies have demonstrated that lipid metabolism disorder may play a vital role in pathogenesis of ONFH and mutation of the paraoxonase-1 (PON-1) gene may be involved in the occurrence of this disease. However, the relationship between polymorphisms of PON-1 and ONFH has not been thoroughly studied. The aim of this study was to determine whether PON-1 polymorphisms are associated with steroid-induced ONFH through a cohort study among Chinese Han population.<h4>Methods</h4>This trial applied a case-control scheme to compare the clinical data including PON-1 SNP among 94 patients and 106 control subjects to analyze the association between SNP and risk of steroid-induced ONFH. Time of Flight Mass Spectrometer is utilized for genotyping and the result was analyzed in multivariate analysis models.<h4>Results</h4>According to polymorphism test of rs662, its SNP was significantly associated with the risk of ONFH in overdominant analysis model [P value: 0.022; odds ratio (OR): 0.39]. However, genotype frequencies of rs662 of PON-1 gene between case and control group showed no differences (P > 0.05).<h4>Conclusions</h4>Our data suggest for the first time that SNP (rs662) of the PON-1 gene was associated with the risk of steroid-induced ONFH. In addition, PAI-1 SNPs may play an important role in pathogenesis of ONFH.<h4>Virtual slides</h4>The virtual slide(s) for this article can be found here: http://www.diagnosticphatology.diagnomx.eu/vs/1501829501107336.",0,
26644461,ALCOdb: Gene Coexpression Database for Microalgae.,"In the era of energy and food shortage, microalgae have gained much attention as promising sources of biofuels and food ingredients. However, only a small fraction of microalgal genes have been functionally characterized. Here, we have developed the Algae Gene Coexpression database (ALCOdb; http://alcodb.jp), which provides gene coexpression information to survey gene modules for a function of interest. ALCOdb currently supports two model algae: the green alga Chlamydomonas reinhardtii and the red alga Cyanidioschyzon merolae. Users can retrieve coexpression information for genes of interest through three unique data pages: (i) Coexpressed Gene List; (ii) Gene Information; and (iii) Coexpressed Gene Network. In addition to the basal coexpression information, ALCOdb also provides several advanced functionalities such as an expression profile viewer and a differentially expressed gene search tool. Using these user interfaces, we demonstrated that our gene coexpression data have the potential to detect functionally related genes and are useful in extrapolating the biological roles of uncharacterized genes. ALCOdb will facilitate molecular and biochemical studies of microalgal biological phenomena, such as lipid metabolism and organelle development, and promote the evolutionary understanding of plant cellular systems.",1,

21278116,"Predicting breed composition using breed frequencies of 50,000 markers from the US Meat Animal Research Center 2,000 Bull Project.","Knowledge of breed composition can be useful in multiple aspects of cattle production, and can be critical for analyzing the results of whole genome-wide association studies currently being conducted around the world. We examine the feasibility and accuracy of using genotype data from the most prevalent bovine genome-wide association studies platform, the Illumina BovineSNP50 array (Illumina Inc., San Diego, CA), to estimate breed composition for individual breeds of cattle. First, allele frequencies (of Illumina-defined allele B) of SNP on the array for each of 16 beef cattle breeds were defined by genotyping a large set of more than 2,000 bulls selected in cooperation with the respective breed associations to be representative of their breed. With these breed-specific allele frequencies, the breed compositions of approximately 2,000 two-, three-, and four-way cross (of 8 breeds) cattle produced at the US Meat Animal Research Center were predicted by using a simple multiple regression technique or Mendel (http://www.genetics.ucla.edu/software/mendel) and their genotypes from the Illumina BovineSNP50 array, and were then compared with pedigree-based estimates of breed composition. The accuracy of marker-based breed composition estimates was 89% when using either estimation method for all breeds except Angus and Red Angus (averaged 79%), based on comparing estimates with pedigree-based average breed composition. Accuracy increased to approximately 88% when these 2 breeds were combined into an aggregate Angus group. Additionally, we used a subset of these markers, approximately 3,000 that populate the Illumina Bovine3K (Illumina Inc.), to see whether breed composition could be estimated with similar accuracy when using this reduced panel of SNP makers. When breed composition was estimated using only SNP in common with the Bovine 3K array, accuracy was slightly reduced to 83%. These results suggest that SNP data from these arrays could be used to estimate breed composition in most US beef cattle in situations where pedigree is not known (e.g., multiple-sire natural service matings, non-source-verified animals in feedlots or at slaughter). This approach can aid analyses that depend on knowledge of breed composition, including identification and adjustment of breed-based population stratification, when performing genome-wide association studies on populations with incomplete pedigrees. In addition, SNP-based breed composition estimates may facilitate fitting cow germplasm to the environment, managing cattle in the feedlot, and tracing disease cases back to the geographic region or farm of origin.",0,
26051252,Light-weight reference-based compression of FASTQ data.,"<h4>Background</h4>The exponential growth of next generation sequencing (NGS) data has posed big challenges to data storage, management and archive. Data compression is one of the effective solutions, where reference-based compression strategies can typically achieve superior compression ratios compared to the ones not relying on any reference.<h4>Results</h4>This paper presents a lossless light-weight reference-based compression algorithm namely LW-FQZip to compress FASTQ data. The three components of any given input, i.e., metadata, short reads and quality score strings, are first parsed into three data streams in which the redundancy information are identified and eliminated independently. Particularly, well-designed incremental and run-length-limited encoding schemes are utilized to compress the metadata and quality score streams, respectively. To handle the short reads, LW-FQZip uses a novel light-weight mapping model to fast map them against external reference sequence(s) and produce concise alignment results for storage. The three processed data streams are then packed together with some general purpose compression algorithms like LZMA. LW-FQZip was evaluated on eight real-world NGS data sets and achieved compression ratios in the range of 0.111-0.201. This is comparable or superior to other state-of-the-art lossless NGS data compression algorithms.<h4>Conclusions</h4>LW-FQZip is a program that enables efficient lossless FASTQ data compression. It contributes to the state of art applications for NGS data storage and transmission. LW-FQZip is freely available online at: http://csse.szu.edu.cn/staff/zhuzx/LWFQZip.",0,
29703719,Sialic Acid Blockade Suppresses Tumor Growth by Enhancing T-cell-Mediated Tumor Immunity.,"Sialic acid sugars on the surface of cancer cells have emerged as potent immune modulators that contribute to the immunosuppressive microenvironment and tumor immune evasion. However, the mechanisms by which these sugars modulate antitumor immunity as well as therapeutic strategies directed against them are limited. Here we report that intratumoral injections with a sialic acid mimetic Ac<sub>5</sub>3F<sub>ax</sub>Neu5Ac block tumor sialic acid expression <i>in vivo</i> and suppress tumor growth in multiple tumor models. Sialic acid blockade had a major impact on the immune cell composition of the tumor, enhancing tumor-infiltrating natural killer cell and CD8<sup>+</sup> T-cell numbers while reducing regulatory T-cell and myeloid regulatory cell numbers. Sialic acid blockade enhanced cytotoxic CD8<sup>+</sup> T-cell-mediated killing of tumor cells in part by facilitating antigen-specific T-cell-tumor cell clustering. Sialic acid blockade also synergized with adoptive transfer of tumor-specific CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells <i>in vivo</i> and enhanced CpG immune adjuvant therapy by increasing dendritic cell activation and subsequent CD8<sup>+</sup> T-cell responses. Collectively, these data emphasize the crucial role of sialic acids in tumor immune evasion and provide proof of concept that sialic acid blockade creates an immune-permissive tumor microenvironment for CD8<sup>+</sup> T-cell-mediated tumor immunity, either as single treatment or in combination with other immune-based intervention strategies.<b>Significance:</b> Sialic acid sugars function as important modulators of the immunosuppressive tumor microenvironment that limit potent antitumor immunity.<b>Graphical Abstract:</b> http://cancerres.aacrjournals.org/content/canres/78/13/3574/F1.large.jpg <i>Cancer Res; 78(13); 3574-88. ©2018 AACR</i>.",0,
31508533,Magnesium supplementation therapy to prevent cisplatin-induced acute nephrotoxicity in pediatric cancer: A protocol for a randomized phase 2 trial.,"Although cisplatin is one of the most effective agents against various pediatric cancers, it is sometimes difficult to manage due to its dose-limiting nephrotoxicity. Magnesium sulfate (Mg) showed a kidney-protective effect against cisplatin-induced nephrotoxicity (CIN) by regulating renal platinum accumulation both in vitro and in vivo, and the body of clinical data demonstrating the efficacy of this drug in adult cancer patients is increasing.In this open, multicenter, phase-2, randomized trial, patients under age 18 years who are scheduled to receive cisplatin-containing chemotherapy will be enrolled and randomly allocated either to an Mg supplementation arm in even-numbered chemotherapy courses (arm AB) or to another arm in odd-numbered courses (arm BA), with a 1:1 allocation. Analysis objects will be reconstructed into two groups depending on whether the chemotherapy course has Mg supplementation (group B) or not (group A). The primary endpoint is the proportion of chemotherapy courses resulting in elevated serum creatinine equal to or greater than 50% of the prechemotherapy value. For the secondary endpoints, various parameters for measuring kidney function, such as serum cystatin-C, B2M, L-FABP, NGAL, and urinary NAG in the two groups will be compared. A sample size based on alpha†=†5% and 80% power requires at least 40 samples per group (ideally, 60 samples per group).If Mg demonstrates efficacy, a phase-3 study to confirm the prophylactic effect of Mg supplementation in both acute and chronic CIN will be developed using novel and better biomarkers.

26243198,miRegulome: a knowledge-base of miRNA regulomics and analysis.,"<h4>Unlabelled</h4>miRNAs regulate post transcriptional gene expression by targeting multiple mRNAs and hence can modulate multiple signalling pathways, biological processes, and patho-physiologies. Therefore, understanding of miRNA regulatory networks is essential in order to modulate the functions of a miRNA. The focus of several existing databases is to provide information on specific aspects of miRNA regulation. However, an integrated resource on the miRNA regulome is currently not available to facilitate the exploration and understanding of miRNA regulomics. miRegulome attempts to bridge this gap. The current version of miRegulome v1.0 provides details on the entire regulatory modules of miRNAs altered in response to chemical treatments and transcription factors, based on validated data manually curated from published literature. Modules of miRegulome (upstream regulators, downstream targets, miRNA regulated pathways, functions, diseases, etc) are hyperlinked to an appropriate external resource and are displayed visually to provide a comprehensive understanding. Four analysis tools are incorporated to identify relationships among different modules based on user specified datasets. miRegulome and its tools are helpful in understanding the biology of miRNAs and will also facilitate the discovery of biomarkers and therapeutics. With added features in upcoming releases, miRegulome will be an essential resource to the scientific community.<h4>Availability</h4>http://bnet.egr.vcu.edu/miRegulome.",1,

21398668,sc-PDB: a database for identifying variations and multiplicity of 'druggable' binding sites in proteins.,"<h4>Background</h4>The sc-PDB database is an annotated archive of druggable binding sites extracted from the Protein Data Bank. It contains all-atoms coordinates for 8166 protein-ligand complexes, chosen for their geometrical and physico-chemical properties. The sc-PDB provides a functional annotation for proteins, a chemical description for ligands and the detailed intermolecular interactions for complexes. The sc-PDB now includes a hierarchical classification of all the binding sites within a functional class.<h4>Method</h4>The sc-PDB entries were first clustered according to the protein name indifferent of the species. For each cluster, we identified dissimilar sites (e.g. catalytic and allosteric sites of an enzyme). SCOPE AND APPLICATIONS: The classification of sc-PDB targets by binding site diversity was intended to facilitate chemogenomics approaches to drug design. In ligand-based approaches, it avoids comparing ligands that do not share the same binding site. In structure-based approaches, it permits to quantitatively evaluate the diversity of the binding site definition (variations in size, sequence and/or structure).<h4>Availability</h4>The sc-PDB database is freely available at: http://bioinfo-pharma.u-strasbg.fr/scPDB.",1,
31618061,Lexical-Level Predictors of Reading Comprehension in Third Grade: Is Spelling a Unique Contributor?,"Purpose Considerable research effort has focused on understanding reading comprehension and reading comprehension difficulties. The purpose of this correlational study was to add to the small but growing body of literature on the role that spelling may play in reading comprehension, by investigating the full range of lexical-level literacy skills and whether spelling makes a unique contribution. This study also explored whether these relations vary with the spelling scoring metric. Method Data were collected from 63 children attending Grade 3 in a Midwestern state. In addition to measuring reading comprehension, word recognition, and vocabulary, 4 spelling scoring metrics were examined: the number of words spelled correctly, the number of correct letter sequences (CLS), and Spelling Sensitivity Scores for elements and for words. Results All spelling metrics were significantly correlated with reading comprehension. Results of hierarchical regressions showed that spelling was a significant, unique predictor of reading comprehension when the CLS metric was used. The scoring metrics were differentially related to reading comprehension. Metrics that gave credit based on orthographic precision only (number of words spelled correctly and CLS) were more highly related to reading comprehension than metrics that scored not only on orthographic accuracy but also on phonological and morphological accuracy (Spelling Sensitivity Scores for elements and for words). Conclusion These results indicate that spelling is related to reading comprehension and have theoretical and clinical implications for the use of spelling assessment.

This method is applied to search the minimum number of hospitals to be designated as ECR hubs in Sydney as well as the population at risk of stroke reachable within 30 min. <b>Methods:</b> Traveling time from the centroids of each suburbs to five ECR capable hubs [Royal Prince Alfred/RPA, Prince of Wales/POW, Royal North Shore/RNS, Liverpool/LH and Westmead/WH]. This step was performed using <i>ggmap</i> package in R to interface with Google Map application program interface (API). Next, we calculate the percentage of suburbs within each catchment in which traveling time to the ECR hub is <30 min. This step was performed for all possible combination of ECR hubs. The maps are available at https://gntem3.shinyapps.io/ambsydney/. The population at risk of stroke was estimated using stroke incident studies in Melbourne and Adelaide. <b>Results:</b> The best 3-hospital combinations are LPH/WH/RNS (82.3, 45.7, and 79.7% of suburbs reachable within 30 min or 187 of 226 suburbs) follow by RPA/LPH/RNS (100.0, 80.9, and 73.1% of suburbs) and LPH/POW/RNS (83.3, 90.7, and 76.6% of suburbs). The best 4-hospital model is LPH/WH/POW/RNS (84.2%, 91.1%, 90.7%, 77.8%). In the 5-hospital model, ECR is available for 191 suburbs within 30 min: LPH (83%), RPA (100%), WH (90.2%), RNS (72.7%), POW (88.9%). Based on 3-hospital model and 15% of patient eligible for ECR, the expected number of cases to be handled by each hospital is 465. This number drops down to 374 if a 4-hospital model is preferred. <b>Conclusions:</b> The simulation studies supported a minimum of 4 ECR hubs servicing Sydney. This model provides data on number of suburbs and population at risk of stroke that can reach these hubs within 30 min.",0,

22161415,Surgical orbital decompression for thyroid eye disease.,"<h4>Background</h4>Orbital decompression is an established procedure for the management of exophthalmos and visual rehabilitation from optic neuropathy in cases of thyroid eye disease. Numerous procedures for removal of orbital bony wall, fat or a combination of these for a variety of indications in different stages of the disease have been well reported in the medical literature. However, the relative effectiveness and safety of these procedures in relation to the various indications remains unclear.<h4>Objectives</h4>To review current published evidence for the effectiveness of surgical orbital decompression for disfiguring proptosis in adult thyroid eye disease and summa rise information on possible complications and the quality of life from the studies identified.<h4>Search methods</h4>We searched CENTRAL (which contains the Cochrane Eyes and Vision Group Trials Register) (The Cochrane Library 2011, Issue 10), MEDLINE (January 1950 to October 2011), EMBASE (January 1980 to October 2011), the metaRegister of Controlled Trials (mRCT) (www.controlled-trials.com) and ClinicalTrials.gov (http://clinicaltrials.gov). There were no date or language restrictions in the electronic searches for trials. The electronic databases were last searched on 6 October 2011. We searched oculoplastic textbooks, conference proceedings from the European and American Society of Ophthalmic Plastic and Reconstructive Surgery (ESOPRS, ASOPRS), European Ophthalmological Society (SOE), the Association for Research in Vision and Ophthalmology (ARVO) and American Academy of Ophthalmology (AAO) for the years 2000 to 2009 to identify relevant data. We attempted to contact researchers who are active in this field for information about further published or unpublished studies.<h4>Selection criteria</h4>We included randomised controlled trials (RCTs) with no restriction on date or language comparing two or more surgical methods for orbital decompression with removal of bony wall, orbital fat or a combination of both for disfiguring proptosis or comparison of surgical techniques with any form of medical decompression.<h4>Data collection and analysis</h4>Each review author independently assessed study abstracts identified from the electronic and manual searches. Author analysis was then compared and full papers for appropriate studies were obtained according to the inclusion criteria. Disagreements between the authors were resolved by discussion.<h4>Main results</h4>We identified two randomised trials eligible for inclusion in the review. There was significant variability between the trials for interventions, methodology and outcome measures and therefore meta-analysis was not performed. One study suggested that the transantral approach and endoscopic transnasal technique had similar effects in reducing exophthalmos but that the endoscopic approach may be safer, relating to fewer complications. This study had short-term follow-up and lacked information on our primary outcome (success or failure of treatment). The second study provided evidence that intravenous steroids may be superior to primary surgical decompression in the management of compressive optic neuropathy requiring less secondary surgical procedures, although it relates more frequently to transient side effects. This study was weakened by a small sample size. Until more credible evidence is available recommendations as to best treatment cannot be reliably made.<h4>Authors' conclusions</h4>A single study showed that the transantral approach for orbital decompression was related to more complications than the endoscopic transnasal technique which is preferred by Ear, Nose and Throat (ENT) surgeons, usually as an adjunctive procedure. Intravenous steroids were reported in a single trial to be the most efficient intervention for dysthyroid optic neuropathy. The majority of published literature on orbital decompression for thyroid eye disease consists of retrospective, cohort, or case series studies. Although these provide useful descriptive information, clarification is required to show the relative effectiveness of each intervention for various indications.The two RCTs reviewed are not robust enough to provide credible evidence to our understanding of current decompressive surgery and to support recommendations for clinical practice. There is evidence from currently available uncontrolled studies that removal of the medial and lateral wall (balanced decompression) with or without fat removal may be the most effective surgical method related to only a few complications.There is a clear need for randomised studies evaluating the balanced two-wall, three-wall and orbital fat decompression techniques. Comparison with other surgical techniques for orbital decompression or with immunosuppression in cases of compressive optic neuropathy would also be important. These studies should primarily address the reduction of exophthalmos, disease severity, complication rates, quality of life and cost of the intervention.",0,
26582915,piRNA cluster database: a web resource for piRNA producing loci.,"Piwi proteins and their guiding small RNAs, termed Piwi-interacting (pi-) RNAs, are essential for silencing of transposons in the germline of animals. A substantial fraction of piRNAs originates from genomic loci termed piRNA clusters and sequences encoded in these piRNA clusters determine putative targets for the Piwi/piRNA system. In the past decade, studies of piRNA transcriptomes in different species revealed additional roles for piRNAs beyond transposon silencing, reflecting the astonishing plasticity of the Piwi/piRNA system along different phylogenetic branches. Moreover, piRNA transcriptomes can change drastically during development and vary across different tissues.Since piRNA clusters crucially shape piRNA profiles, analysis of these loci is imperative for a thorough understanding of functional and evolutionary aspects of the piRNA pathway. But despite the ever-growing amount of available piRNA sequence data, we know little about the factors that determine differential regulation of piRNA clusters, nor the evolutionary events that cause their gain or loss.In order to facilitate addressing these subjects, we established a user-friendly piRNA cluster database (http://www.smallrnagroup-mainz.de/piRNAclusterDB.html) that provides comprehensive data on piRNA clusters in multiple species, tissues and developmental stages based on small RNA sequence data deposited at NCBI's Sequence Read Archive (SRA).",1,
22014236,An integrated workflow for robust alignment and simplified quantitative analysis of NMR spectrometry data.,"<h4>Background</h4>Nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy (NMR) is a powerful technique to reveal and compare quantitative metabolic profiles of biological tissues. However, chemical and physical sample variations make the analysis of the data challenging, and typically require the application of a number of preprocessing steps prior to data interpretation. For example, noise reduction, normalization, baseline correction, peak picking, spectrum alignment and statistical analysis are indispensable components in any NMR analysis pipeline.<h4>Results</h4>We introduce a novel suite of informatics tools for the quantitative analysis of NMR metabolomic profile data. The core of the processing cascade is a novel peak alignment algorithm, called hierarchical Cluster-based Peak Alignment (CluPA). The algorithm aligns a target spectrum to the reference spectrum in a top-down fashion by building a hierarchical cluster tree from peak lists of reference and target spectra and then dividing the spectra into smaller segments based on the most distant clusters of the tree. To reduce the computational time to estimate the spectral misalignment, the method makes use of Fast Fourier Transformation (FFT) cross-correlation. Since the method returns a high-quality alignment, we can propose a simple methodology to study the variability of the NMR spectra. For each aligned NMR data point the ratio of the between-group and within-group sum of squares (BW-ratio) is calculated to quantify the difference in variability between and within predefined groups of NMR spectra. This differential analysis is related to the calculation of the F-statistic or a one-way ANOVA, but without distributional assumptions. Statistical inference based on the BW-ratio is achieved by bootstrapping the null distribution from the experimental data.<h4>Conclusions</h4>The workflow performance was evaluated using a previously published dataset. Correlation maps, spectral and grey scale plots show clear improvements in comparison to other methods, and the down-to-earth quantitative analysis works well for the CluPA-aligned spectra. The whole workflow is embedded into a modular and statistically sound framework that is implemented as an R package called ""speaq"" (""spectrum alignment and quantitation""), which is freely available from http://code.google.com/p/speaq/.",0,
25966491,Social Science Collaboration with Environmental Health.,"<h4>Background</h4>Social science research has been central in documenting and analyzing community discovery of environmental exposure and consequential processes. Collaboration with environmental health science through team projects has advanced and improved our understanding of environmental health and justice.<h4>Objective</h4>We sought to identify diverse methods and topics in which social scientists have expanded environmental health understandings at multiple levels, to examine how transdisciplinary environmental health research fosters better science, and to learn how these partnerships have been able to flourish because of the support from National Institute of Environmental Health Sciences (NIEHS).<h4>Methods</h4>We analyzed various types of social science research to investigate how social science contributes to environmental health. We also examined NIEHS programs that foster social science. In addition, we developed a case study of a community-based participation research project in Akwesasne in order to demonstrate how social science has enhanced environmental health science.<h4>Results</h4>Social science has informed environmental health science through ethnographic studies of contaminated communities, analysis of spatial distribution of environmental injustice, psychological experience of contamination, social construction of risk and risk perception, and social impacts of disasters. Social science-environmental health team science has altered the way scientists traditionally explore exposure by pressing for cumulative exposure approaches and providing research data for policy applications.<h4>Conclusions</h4>A transdisciplinary approach for environmental health practice has emerged that engages the social sciences to paint a full picture of the consequences of contamination so that policy makers, regulators, public health officials, and other stakeholders can better ameliorate impacts and prevent future exposure.<h4>Citation</h4>Hoover E, Renauld M, Edelstein MR, Brown P. 2015.

22710135,TWARIT: an extremely rapid and efficient approach for phylogenetic classification of metagenomic sequences.,"Phylogenetic assignment of individual sequence reads to their respective taxa, referred to as 'taxonomic binning', constitutes a key step of metagenomic analysis. Existing binning methods have limitations either with respect to time or accuracy/specificity of binning. Given these limitations, development of a method that can bin vast amounts of metagenomic sequence data in a rapid, efficient and computationally inexpensive manner can profoundly influence metagenomic analysis in computational resource poor settings. We introduce TWARIT, a hybrid binning algorithm, that employs a combination of short-read alignment and composition-based signature sorting approaches to achieve rapid binning rates without compromising on binning accuracy and specificity. TWARIT is validated with simulated and real-world metagenomes and the results demonstrate significantly lower overall binning times compared to that of existing methods. Furthermore, the binning accuracy and specificity of TWARIT are observed to be comparable/superior to them. A web server implementing TWARIT algorithm is available at http://metagenomics.atc.tcs.com/Twarit/",0,
IND607322953,First Report of Grapevine Red Globe Virus in Grapevines in Washington State,"Grapevine red globe virus (GRGV; genus Maculavirus, family Tymoviridae) has been reported in grapevines (Vitis spp.) from Italy, Greece, France, China, Spain, and Germany and in California, U.S.A. (Cretazzo et al. 2017; Fan et al. 2016; Ruiz-Garcia et al. 2018; Sabanadzovic et al. 2000). During surveys of grapevine nurseries, a total of 241 composite samples, each consisting of four petioles from mature leaves/vine from five asymptomatic grapevines, from 33 grapevine (Vitis vinifera) cultivars were collected. Total RNA isolated from these samples using a Spectrum Total RNA isolation kit (Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, MO) was subjected to high-throughput sequencing (HTS) on an Illumina HiSeq2500 or NovaSeq 6000 platform in paired-end mode (Genomics Core Facility, Huntsman Cancer Institute, Utah University, Salt Lake City, UT). After trimming raw reads based on quality and ambiguity, the paired-end quality reads of approximately 120 (HiSeq) or 145 (NovaSeq) base pair (bp) length were assembled de novo into a pool of contigs (CLC Genomics Workbench 12). These contigs were subjected to BLASTn analysis against the nonredundant virus database from GenBank (https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/blast). A total of 49 contig sequences, ranging from 200 to 1,645 bp in length with an average coverage ranging up to 418.7, aligning with GRGV genome, were detected in cultivars Aglianico, Cabernet franc, Pinot gris, and Riesling. BLASTn analysis of contigs greater than 500 bp in length showed sequence identity between 88.5 and 95% with corresponding GRGV sequences reported from other countries. These results indicated the presence of genetically distinct isolates of GRGV. HTS data also revealed coinfection of GRGV in all samples with one or more of the following viruses and/or viroids: grapevine rupestris stem pitting associated virus, grapevine rupestris vein feathering virus, hop stunt viroid, or grapevine yellow speckle viroid-1. To further confirm infection by GRGV, total RNA was extracted from two asymptomatic Pinot gris vines that previously tested positive in HTS using the Spectrum Total RNA isolation kit and subjected to reverse transcription PCR using primers specific to the replicase polyprotein gene of the virus (RG4847F, 5'-TGGTCTGTTGTTCGCATCTT-3'; RG6076R, 5' CGGAAGGGGAAGCATTGATCT-3' Cretazzo et al. 2017). Sequence analysis of the approximately 1,250-bp amplicons (accession no. MT749359) showed 91.2% nt sequence identity with a corresponding sequence of GRGV isolate from Brazil (KX828704.1). To our knowledge, this is the first report of GRGV in Washington State. Together with the report of the occurrence of GRGV in California (Sabanadzovic et al. 2000), these results indicate wide geographical distribution of the virus. Although GRGV can cause asymptomatic infections in grapevines (Martelli et al. 2002), the economic importance of GRGV as single or coinfections with other viruses needs to be examined to assess the potential significance of the virus to grape production and grapevine certification programs.",0,
33832071,Genomic analysis of pancreatic cancer reveals 3 molecular subtypes with different clinical outcomes.,"<h4>Abstract</h4>Pancreatic cancer has a very high mortality with a 5-year survival of <5%. The purpose of this study was to classify specific molecular subtypes associated with prognosis of pancreatic cancer using The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) multiplatform genomic data.Multiplatform genomic data (N = 178), including gene expression, copy number alteration, and somatic mutation data, were obtained from cancer browser (https://genome-cancer.ucsc.edu, cohort: TCGA Pancreatic Cancer). Clinical data including survival results were analyzed. We also used validation cohort (GSE50827) to confirm the robustness of these molecular subtypes in pancreatic cancer.When we performed unsupervised clustering using TCGA gene expression data, we found three distinct molecular subtypes associated with different survival results. Copy number alteration and somatic mutation data showed different genomic patterns for these three subtypes. Ingenuity pathway analysis revealed that each subtype showed differentially altered pathways. Using each subtype-specific genes (200 were selected), we could predict molecular subtype in another cohort, confirming the robustness of these molecular subtypes of pancreatic cancer. Cox regression analysis revealed that molecular subtype is the only significant prognostic factor for pancreatic cancer (P = .042, 95% confidence interval 0.523-0.98).Genomic analysis of pancreatic cancer revealed 3 distinct molecular subtypes associated with different survival results. Using these subtype-specific genes and prediction model, we could predict molecular subtype associated with prognosis of pancreatic cancer.",0,
23209799,The duplicated genes database: identification and functional annotation of co-localised duplicated genes across genomes.,"<h4>Background</h4>There has been a surge in studies linking genome structure and gene expression, with special focus on duplicated genes. Although initially duplicated from the same sequence, duplicated genes can diverge strongly over evolution and take on different functions or regulated expression. However, information on the function and expression of duplicated genes remains sparse. Identifying groups of duplicated genes in different genomes and characterizing their expression and function would therefore be of great interest to the research community. The 'Duplicated Genes Database' (DGD) was developed for this purpose.<h4>Methodology</h4>Nine species were included in the DGD. For each species, BLAST analyses were conducted on peptide sequences corresponding to the genes mapped on a same chromosome. Groups of duplicated genes were defined based on these pairwise BLAST comparisons and the genomic location of the genes. For each group, Pearson correlations between gene expression data and semantic similarities between functional GO annotations were also computed when the relevant information was available.<h4>Conclusions</h4>The Duplicated Gene Database provides a list of co-localised and duplicated genes for several species with the available gene co-expression level and semantic similarity value of functional annotation. Adding these data to the groups of duplicated genes provides biological information that can prove useful to gene expression analyses. The Duplicated Gene Database can be freely accessed through the DGD website at http://dgd.genouest.org.",1,
21750706,GenExp: an interactive web-based genomic DAS client with client-side data rendering.,"<h4>Background</h4>The Distributed Annotation System (DAS) offers a standard protocol for sharing and integrating annotations on biological sequences. There are more than 1000 DAS sources available and the number is steadily increasing. Clients are an essential part of the DAS system and integrate data from several independent sources in order to create a useful representation to the user. While web-based DAS clients exist, most of them do not have direct interaction capabilities such as dragging and zooming with the mouse.<h4>Results</h4>Here we present GenExp, a web based and fully interactive visual DAS client. GenExp is a genome oriented DAS client capable of creating informative representations of genomic data zooming out from base level to complete chromosomes. It proposes a novel approach to genomic data rendering and uses the latest HTML5 web technologies to create the data representation inside the client browser. Thanks to client-side rendering most position changes do not need a network request to the server and so responses to zooming and panning are almost immediate. In GenExp it is possible to explore the genome intuitively moving it with the mouse just like geographical map applications. Additionally, in GenExp it is possible to have more than one data viewer at the same time and to save the current state of the application to revisit it later on.<h4>Conclusions</h4>GenExp is a new interactive web-based client for DAS and addresses some of the short-comings of the existing clients. It uses client-side data rendering techniques resulting in easier genome browsing and exploration. GenExp is open source under the GPL license and it is freely available at http://gralggen.lsi.upc.edu/recerca/genexp.",0,
30268934,GAAD: A Gene and Autoimmiune Disease Association Database.,"Autoimmune diseases (ADs) arise from an abnormal immune response of the body against substances and tissues normally present in the body. More than a hundred of ADs have been described in the literature so far. Although their etiology remains largely unclear, various types of ADs tend to share more associated genes with other types of ADs than with non-AD types. Here we present GAAD, a gene and AD association database. In GAAD, we collected 44,762 associations between 49 ADs and 4249 genes from public databases and MEDLINE documents. We manually verified the associations to ensure the quality and credibility. We reconstructed and recapitulated the relationships among ADs using their shared genes, which further validated the quality of our data. We also provided a list of significantly co-occurring gene pairs among ADs; with embedded tools, users can query gene co-occurrences and construct customized co-occurrence network with genes of interest. To make GAAD more straightforward to experimental biologists and medical scientists, we extracted additional information describing the associations through text mining, including the putative diagnostic value of the associations, type and position of gene polymorphisms, expression changes of implicated genes, as well as the phenotypical consequences, and grouped the associations accordingly.

24178034,IDEAL in 2014 illustrates interaction networks composed of intrinsically disordered proteins and their binding partners.,"IDEAL (Intrinsically Disordered proteins with Extensive Annotations and Literature, http://www.ideal.force.cs.is.nagoya-u.ac.jp/IDEAL/) is a collection of intrinsically disordered proteins (IDPs) that cannot adopt stable globular structures under physiological conditions. Since its previous publication in 2012, the number of entries in IDEAL has almost tripled (120 to 340). In addition to the increase in quantity, the quality of IDEAL has been significantly improved. The new IDEAL incorporates the interactions of IDPs and their binding partners more explicitly, and illustrates the protein-protein interaction (PPI) networks and the structures of protein complexes. Redundant experimental data are arranged based on the clustering of Protein Data Bank entries, and similar sequences with the same binding mode are grouped. As a result, the new IDEAL presents more concise and informative experimental data. Nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) disorder is annotated in a systematic manner, by identifying the regions with large deviations among the NMR models. The ordered/disordered and new domain predictions by DICHOT are available, as well as the domain assignments by HMMER. Some examples of the PPI networks and the highly deviated regions derived from NMR models will be described, together with other advances. These enhancements will facilitate deeper understanding of IDPs, in terms of their flexibility, plasticity and promiscuity.",1,
27152837,Evaluation of OASIS QSAR Models Using ToxCast‚Ñ¢ in Vitro Estrogen and Androgen Receptor Binding Data and Application in an Integrated Endocrine Screening Approach.,"<h4>Background</h4>Integrative testing strategies (ITSs) for potential endocrine activity can use tiered in silico and in vitro models. Each component of an ITS should be thoroughly assessed.<h4>Objectives</h4>We used the data from three in vitro ToxCastô binding assays to assess OASIS, a quantitative structure-activity relationship (QSAR) platform covering both estrogen receptor (ER) and androgen receptor (AR) binding. For stronger binders (described here as AC50 < 1 µM), we also examined the relationship of QSAR predictions of ER or AR binding to the results from 18 ER and 10 AR transactivation assays, 72 ER-binding reference compounds, and the in vivo uterotrophic assay.<h4>Methods</h4>NovaScreen binding assay data for ER (human, bovine, and mouse) and AR (human, chimpanzee, and rat) were used to assess the sensitivity, specificity, concordance, and applicability domain of two OASIS QSAR models. The binding strength relative to the QSAR-predicted binding strength was examined for the ER data. The relationship of QSAR predictions of binding to transactivation- and pathway-based assays, as well as to in vivo uterotrophic responses, was examined.<h4>Results</h4>The QSAR models had both high sensitivity (> 75%) and specificity (> 86%) for ER as well as both high sensitivity (92-100%) and specificity (70-81%) for AR. For compounds within the domains of the ER and AR QSAR models that bound with AC50 < 1 µM, the QSAR models accurately predicted the binding for the parent compounds. The parent compounds were active in all transactivation assays where metabolism was incorporated and, except for those compounds known to require metabolism to manifest activity, all assay platforms where metabolism was not incorporated. Compounds in-domain and predicted to bind by the ER QSAR model that were positive in ToxCastô ER binding at AC50 < 1 µM were active in the uterotrophic assay.<h4>Conclusions</h4>We used the extensive ToxCastô HTS binding data set to show that OASIS ER and AR QSAR models had high sensitivity and specificity when compounds were in-domain of the models. Based on this research, we recommend a tiered screening approach wherein a) QSAR is used to identify compounds in-domain of the ER or AR binding models and predicted to bind; b) those compounds are screened in vitro to assess binding potency; and c) the stronger binders (AC50 < 1 µM) are screened in vivo. This scheme prioritizes compounds for integrative testing and risk assessment. Importantly, compounds that are not in-domain, that are predicted either not to bind or to bind weakly, that are not active in in vitro, that require metabolism to manifest activity, or for which in vivo AR testing is in order, need to be assessed differently.<h4>Citation</h4>Bhhatarai B, Wilson DM, Price PS, Marty S, Parks AK, Carney E. 2016.

33851388,Acquired FXIII Deficiency is Associated with High Morbidity.,"<h4>Background</h4> A factor XIII (FXIII) level >30% is considered necessary to prevent spontaneous bleeding. Bleeding is also a risk in patients with acquired FXIII deficiency, but the hemostatic level of FXIII in this context remains to be determined.<h4>Methods</h4> We retrospectively analyzed all patients diagnosed with acquired FXIII deficiency at a large hospital over 3 years (study ID NCT04416594, http://www.clinicaltrials.gov) and assessed clinical data to identify the best cut-off point for FXIII activity to distinguish between low and high risk of major bleeding in a mixed medical and surgical population.<h4>Results</h4> Of the 97 patients who experienced bleeding despite a normal coagulation test, 43.2% had FXIII activity <70%. FXIII activity was significantly lower in surgical patients and patients admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU). Low FXIII activity was significantly associated with long ICU stays and a high incidence of major bleeding.<h4>Conclusion</h4> Acquired FXIII deficiency is associated with high morbidity. The hemostatic level of FXIII in the setting of acquired FXIII deficiency might be above 30%.",0,
25837579,Maximum-Likelihood Phylogenetic Inference with Selection on Protein Folding Stability.,"Despite intense work, incorporating constraints on protein native structures into the mathematical models of molecular evolution remains difficult, because most models and programs assume that protein sites evolve independently, whereas protein stability is maintained by interactions between sites. Here, we address this problem by developing a new mean-field substitution model that generates independent site-specific amino acid distributions with constraints on the stability of the native state against both unfolding and misfolding. The model depends on a background distribution of amino acids and one selection parameter that we fix maximizing the likelihood of the observed protein sequence. The analytic solution of the model shows that the main determinant of the site-specific distributions is the number of native contacts of the site and that the most variable sites are those with an intermediate number of native contacts. The mean-field models obtained, taking into account misfolded conformations, yield larger likelihood than models that only consider the native state, because their average hydrophobicity is more realistic, and they produce on the average stable sequences for most proteins. We evaluated the mean-field model with respect to empirical substitution models on 12 test data sets of different protein families. In all cases, the observed site-specific sequence profiles presented smaller Kullback-Leibler divergence from the mean-field distributions than from the empirical substitution model. Next, we obtained substitution rates combining the mean-field frequencies with an empirical substitution model. The resulting mean-field substitution model assigns larger likelihood than the empirical model to all studied families when we consider sequences with identity larger than 0.35, plausibly a condition that enforces conservation of the native structure across the family. We found that the mean-field model performs better than other structurally constrained models with similar or higher complexity. With respect to the much more complex model recently developed by Bordner and Mittelmann, which takes into account pairwise terms in the amino acid distributions and also optimizes the exchangeability matrix, our model performed worse for data with small sequence divergence but better for data with larger sequence divergence. The mean-field model has been implemented into the computer program Prot_Evol that is freely available at http://ub.cbm.uam.es/software/Prot_Evol.php.",0,
IND605918011,Genetic diversity of endangered orchid Phaius australis across a fragmented Australian landscape,"Historical events such as colonisation, spatial distribution across different habitats, and contemporary processes, such as human-mediated habitat fragmentation can leave lasting imprints on the population genetics of a species. Orchids currently comprise 17% of threatened flora species in Australia (Environment Protection and Biodiversity Conservation Act 1999) due to the combination of fragmentation and illegal harvesting (Benwell in Recovery plan, swamp orchids Phaius australis, Phaius tancarvilliae, NSW National Parks and Wildlife Service, Sydney, 1994; Jones in A complete guide to native orchids of Australia including the island territories, 2nd†edn, Reed Natural History, Sydney, 2006; DE in Phaius australis in species profile and threats database, Department of the Environment. http://www.environment.gov.au/sprat , 2015). The federally endangered Swamp Orchid Phaius australis has a disjunct distribution across an almost 2000†km latitudinal range along Australiaís east coast but it was estimated that 95% of the populations have been lost since European settlement (Benwell 1994). Phaius australis is endangered due to illegal collection and habitat loss that has resulted in limited connectivity between populations, in ecosystems that are vulnerable to climate change. Thus the genetic impacts of its history combined with more recent fragmentation may have impacts on its future viability especially in light of changing environmental conditions. Thirty-four populations were sampled from tropical north Queensland to the southern edge of the subtropics in New South Wales. Population genetics analysis was conducted using 13 polymorphic microsatellite markers developed for the species using NextGen sequencing. Spatial genetic patterns indicate post-colonisation divergence from the tropics southwards to its current climate niche limits. Genetic diversity is low across all populations (A = 1.5, H <U+2091> =†0.171), and there is little evidence of genetic differentiation between regions. Consistent with population genetic theory, the historic loss of populations has resulted in significantly lower genetic diversity in small populations compared to large (P, A, He; p < 0.05). The viability and persistence of P. australis populations now and in a changing climate are discussed in the context of conservation priorities.",0,

23377977,Discovery of microRNA regulatory networks by integrating multidimensional high-throughput data.,"MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are endogenous non-coding RNAs (ncRNAs) of approximately 22 nt that regulate the expression of a large fraction of genes by targeting messenger RNAs (mRNAs). However, determining the biologically significant targets of miRNAs is an ongoing challenge. In this chapter, we describe how to identify miRNA-target interactions and miRNA regulatory networks from high-throughput deep sequencing, CLIP-Seq (HITS-CLIP, PAR-CLIP) and degradome sequencing data using starBase platforms. In starBase, several web-based and stand-alone computational tools were developed to discover Argonaute (Ago) binding and cleavage sites, miRNA-target interactions, perform enrichment analysis of miRNA target genes in Gene Ontology (GO) categories and biological pathways, and identify combinatorial effects between Ago and other RNA-binding proteins (RBPs). Investigating target pathways of miRNAs in human CLIP-Seq data, we found that many cancer-associated miRNAs modulate cancer pathways. Performing an enrichment analysis of genes targeted by highly expressed miRNAs in the mouse brain showed that many miRNAs are involved in cancer-associated MAPK signaling and glioma pathways, as well as neuron-associated neurotrophin signaling and axon guidance pathways. Moreover, thousands of combinatorial binding sites between Ago and RBPs were identified from CLIP-Seq data suggesting RBPs and miRNAs coordinately regulate mRNA transcripts. As a means of comprehensively integrating CLIP-Seq and Degradome-Seq data, the starBase platform is expected to identify clinically relevant miRNA-target regulatory relationships, and reveal multi-dimensional post-transcriptional regulatory networks involving miRNAs and RBPs. starBase is available at                  http://starbase.sysu.edu.cn/                                .",0,

23504705,Accurate prediction of hot spot residues through physicochemical characteristics of amino acid sequences.,"Hot spot residues of proteins are fundamental interface residues that help proteins perform their functions. Detecting hot spots by experimental methods is costly and time-consuming. Sequential and structural information has been widely used in the computational prediction of hot spots. However, structural information is not always available. In this article, we investigated the problem of identifying hot spots using only physicochemical characteristics extracted from amino acid sequences. We first extracted 132 relatively independent physicochemical features from a set of the 544 properties in AAindex1, an amino acid index database. Each feature was utilized to train a classification model with a novel encoding schema for hot spot prediction by the IBk algorithm, an extension of the K-nearest neighbor algorithm. The combinations of the individual classifiers were explored and the classifiers that appeared frequently in the top performing combinations were selected. The hot spot predictor was built based on an ensemble of these classifiers and to work in a voting manner. Experimental results demonstrated that our method effectively exploited the feature space and allowed flexible weights of features for different queries. On the commonly used hot spot benchmark sets, our method significantly outperformed other machine learning algorithms and state-of-the-art hot spot predictors.

29572201,"Investigating the Impact of Hearing Aid Use and Auditory Training on Cognition, Depressive Symptoms, and Social Interaction in Adults With Hearing Loss: Protocol for a Crossover Trial.","BACKGROUND:Sensorineural hearing loss is the most common sensory deficit among older adults. Some of the psychosocial consequences of this condition include difficulty in understanding speech, depression, and social isolation. Studies have shown that older adults with hearing loss show some age-related cognitive decline. Hearing aids have been proven as successful interventions to alleviate sensorineural hearing loss. In addition to hearing aid use, the positive effects of auditory training-formal listening activities designed to optimize speech perception-are now being documented among adults with hearing loss who use hearing aids, especially new hearing aid users. Auditory training has also been shown to produce prolonged cognitive performance improvements. However, there is still little evidence to support the benefits of simultaneous hearing aid use and individualized face-to-face auditory training on cognitive performance in adults with hearing loss. OBJECTIVE:This study will investigate whether using hearing aids for the first time will improve the impact of individualized face-to-face auditory training on cognition, depression, and social interaction for adults with sensorineural hearing loss. The rationale for this study is based on the hypothesis that, in adults with sensorineural hearing loss, using hearing aids for the first time in combination with individualized face-to-face auditory training will be more effective for improving cognition, depressive symptoms, and social interaction rather than auditory training on its own. METHODS:This is a crossover trial targeting 40 men and women between 50 and 90 years of age with either mild or moderate symmetric sensorineural hearing loss. Consented, willing participants will be recruited from either an independent living accommodation or via a community database to undergo a 6-month intensive face-to-face auditory training program (active control). Participants will be assigned in random order to receive hearing aid (intervention) for either the first 3 or last 3 months of the 6-month auditory training program. Each participant will be tested at baseline, 3, and 6 months using a neuropsychological battery of computer-based cognitive assessments, together with a depression symptom instrument and a social interaction measure. The primary outcome will be cognitive performance with regard to spatial working memory. Secondary outcome measures include other cognition performance measures, depressive symptoms, social interaction, and hearing satisfaction. RESULTS:Data analysis is currently under way and the first results are expected to be submitted for publication in June 2018. CONCLUSIONS:Results from the study will inform strategies for aural rehabilitation, hearing aid delivery, and future hearing loss intervention trials.

29985974,Noise peak filtering in multi-dimensional NMR spectra using convolutional neural networks.,"<h4>Motivation</h4>Multi-dimensional NMR spectra are generally used for NMR signal assignment and structure analysis. There are several programs that can achieve highly automated NMR signal assignments and structure analysis. On the other hand, NMR spectra tend to have a large number of noise peaks even for data acquired with good sample and machine conditions, and it is still difficult to eliminate these noise peaks.<h4>Results</h4>We have developed a method to eliminate noise peaks using convolutional neural networks, implemented in the program package Filt_Robot. The filtering accuracy of Filt_Robot was around 90-95% when applied to 2D and 3D NMR spectra, and the numbers of resulting non-noise peaks were close to those in corresponding manually prepared peaks lists. The filtering can strongly enhance automated NMR spectra analysis.<h4>Availability and implementation</h4>The full package of the program, documents and example data are available from http://bmrbdep.pdbj.org/en/nmr_tool_box/Filt_Robot.html.<h4>Supplementary information</h4>Supplementary data are available at Bioinformatics online.",0,
31490686,TMB Library of Nucleosome Simulations.,"Nucleosomes are the fundamental building blocks of chromatin, the biomaterial that houses the genome in all higher organisms. A nucleosome consists of 145-147 base pairs of DNA wrapped 1.7 times around eight histones. Given a four-letter code (A, C, G, T), there are approximately 4147 or 1088 oligonucleotides that can form a nucleosome. Comparative, rather than comprehensive, studies are required. Here we introduce the TMB Library of nucleosome simulations and present a meta-analysis of over 20 µs of all atom molecular dynamics simulations representing 518 different realizations of the nucleosome. The TMB Library serves as a reference for future comparative, on-demand simulations of nucleosomes and a demonstration of iBIOMES Lite as a tool for managing a laboratory's simulation library. For every simulation, dewatered trajectories, RMSD, and DNA helical parameter data are provided through iBIOMES Lite in a Web browser and a file browser format. A novel view of nucleosomal DNA emerges from our meta-analysis of the TMB Library. DNA conformation is restricted to a specific left-handed superhelix, but the range of conformations observed for individual bases and base pairs is not more restricted nor more highly deformed than DNA free in solution. With the exception of Roll, mean DNA helical parameter values obtained from simulations of nucleosomes are largely within the range of thermal motion of DNA free in solution. The library provides evidence of DNA kinking in the nucleosome and clearly demonstrates the effects of DNA sequence on the gross structure and dynamics of nucleosomes. These effects and mispositioning of the 601 super strong nucleosome positioning sequence can be detected in short simulations (10 ns). Collectively, the results provide a basis for comparative simulation studies of nucleosomes and extend our understanding of the binding of proteins and drugs to nucleosomal DNA. The TMB Library can be found at http://dna.engr.latech.edu/~tmbshare/ .",1,
28605774,GenomeHubs: simple containerized setup of a custom Ensembl database and web server for any species.,"<h4>Database url</h4>http://GenomeHubs.org.As the generation and use of genomic datasets is becoming increasingly common in all areas of biology, the need for resources to collate, analyse and present data from one or more genome projects is becoming more pressing. The Ensembl platform is a powerful tool to make genome data and cross-species analyses easily accessible through a web interface and a comprehensive application programming interface. Here we introduce GenomeHubs, which provide a containerized environment to facilitate the setup and hosting of custom Ensembl genome browsers. This simplifies mirroring of existing content and import of new genomic data into the Ensembl database schema. GenomeHubs also provide a set of analysis containers to decorate imported genomes with results of standard analyses and functional annotations and support export to flat files, including EMBL format for submission of assemblies and annotations to International Nucleotide Sequence Database Collaboration.",0,
23342084,Early growth response 3 (Egr3) is highly over-expressed in non-relapsing prostate cancer but not in relapsing prostate cancer.,"Members of the early growth response (EGR) family of transcription factors play diverse functions in response to many cellular stimuli, including growth, stress, and inflammation. Egr3 has gone relatively unstudied, but here through use of the SPECS (Strategic Partners for the Evaluation of Predictive Signatures of Prostate Cancer) Affymetrix whole genome gene expression database we report that Egr3 mRNA is significantly over-expressed in prostate cancer compared to normal prostate tissue (5-fold). The Human Protein Atlas (http://www.proteinatlas.org), a database of tissue microarrays labeled with antibodies against over 11,000 human proteins, was utilized to quantify Egr3 protein expression in normal prostate and prostate cancer patients. In agreement with the SPECS data, we found that Egr3 protein is significantly increased in prostate cancer. The SPECS database has the benefit of extensive clinical follow up for the prostate cancer patients. Analysis of Egr3 mRNA expression in relation to the relapse status reveals that Egr3 mRNA expression is increased in tumor cells of non-relapsed samples (n = 63) compared to normal prostate cells, but is significantly lower in relapsed samples (n = 38) compared to non-relapse. The observations were confirmed using an independent data set. A list of genes correlating with this unique expression pattern was determined. These Egr3-correlated genes were enriched with Egr binding sites in their promoters. The gene list contains inflammatory genes such as IL-6, IL-8, IL1ﬂ and COX-2, which have extensive connections to prostate cancer.",0,

28263273,Hospital Administration and Nursing Leadership in Disasters: An Exploratory Study Using Concept Mapping.,"Strong leadership is critical in disaster situations when ""patient surge"" challenges a hospital's capacity to respond and normally acceptable patterns of care are disrupted. Activation of the emergency operations plan triggers an incident command system structure for leadership decision making. Yet, implementation of the emergency operations plan and incident command system protocols is ultimately subject to nursing and hospital leadership at the service- and unit level. The results of these service-/unit-based leadership decisions have the potential to directly impact staff and patient safety, quality of care, and ultimately, patient outcomes. Despite the critical nature of these events, nurse leaders and administrators receive little education regarding leadership and decision making during disaster events. The purpose of this study is to identify essential competencies of nursing and hospital administrators' leadership during disaster events. An integrative mixed-methods design combining qualitative and quantitative approaches to data collection and analysis was used. Five focus groups were conducted with nurse leaders and hospital administrators at a large urban hospital in the Northeastern United States in a collaborative group process to generate relevant leadership competencies. Concept Systems Incorporated was used to sort, prioritize, and analyze the data (http://conceptsystemsinc.com/). The results suggest that participants' institutional knowledge (of existing resources, communications, processes) and prior disaster experience increase leadership competence.",0,
22954625,Performance reproducibility index for classification.,"<h4>Motivation</h4>A common practice in biomarker discovery is to decide whether a large laboratory experiment should be carried out based on the results of a preliminary study on a small set of specimens. Consideration of the efficacy of this approach motivates the introduction of a probabilistic measure, for whether a classifier showing promising results in a small-sample preliminary study will perform similarly on a large independent sample. Given the error estimate from the preliminary study, if the probability of reproducible error is low, then there is really no purpose in substantially allocating more resources to a large follow-on study. Indeed, if the probability of the preliminary study providing likely reproducible results is small, then why even perform the preliminary study?<h4>Results</h4>This article introduces a reproducibility index for classification, measuring the probability that a sufficiently small error estimate on a small sample will motivate a large follow-on study. We provide a simulation study based on synthetic distribution models that possess known intrinsic classification difficulties and emulate real-world scenarios. We also set up similar simulations on four real datasets to show the consistency of results. The reproducibility indices for different distributional models, real datasets and classification schemes are empirically calculated. The effects of reporting and multiple-rule biases on the reproducibility index are also analyzed.<h4>Availability</h4>We have implemented in C code the synthetic data distribution model, classification rules, feature selection routine and error estimation methods.

27092486,Profilings of MicroRNAs in the Liver of Common Carp (Cyprinus carpio) Infected with Flavobacterium columnare.,"MicroRNAs (miRNAs) play important roles in regulation of many biological processes in eukaryotes, including pathogen infection and host interactions. Flavobacterium columnare (FC) infection can cause great economic loss of common carp (Cyprinus carpio) which is one of the most important cultured fish in the world. However, miRNAs in response to FC infection in common carp has not been characterized. To identify specific miRNAs involved in common carp infected with FC, we performed microRNA sequencing using livers of common carp infected with and without FC. A total of 698 miRNAs were identified, including 142 which were identified and deposited in the miRbase database (Available online: http://www.mirbase.org/) and 556 had only predicted miRNAs. Among the deposited miRNAs, eight miRNAs were first identified in common carp. Thirty of the 698 miRNAs were differentially expressed miRNAs (DIE-miRNAs) between the FC infected and control samples. From the DIE-miRNAs, seven were selected randomly and their expression profiles were confirmed to be consistent with the microRNA sequencing results using RT-PCR and qRT-PCR. In addition, a total of 27,363 target genes of the 30 DIE-miRNAs were predicted. The target genes were enriched in five Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) pathways, including focal adhesion, extracellular matrix (ECM)-receptor interaction, erythroblastic leukemia viral oncogene homolog (ErbB) signaling pathway, regulation of actin cytoskeleton, and adherent junction. The miRNA expression profile of the liver of common carp infected with FC will pave the way for the development of effective strategies to fight against FC infection.",0,
25561511,Genomic classifier ColoPrint predicts recurrence in stage II colorectal cancer patients more accurately than clinical factors.,"<h4>Background</h4>Approximately 20% of patients with stage II colorectal cancer will experience a relapse. Current clinical-pathologic stratification factors do not allow clear identification of these high-risk patients. ColoPrint (Agendia, Amsterdam, The Netherlands, http://www.agendia.com) is a gene expression classifier that distinguishes patients with low or high risk of disease relapse.<h4>Methods</h4>ColoPrint was developed using whole-genome expression data and validated in several independent validation cohorts. Stage II patients from these studies were pooled (n = 416), and ColoPrint was compared with clinical risk factors described in the National Comprehensive Cancer Network (NCCN) 2013 Guidelines for Colon Cancer. Median follow-up was 81 months. Most patients (70%) did not receive adjuvant chemotherapy. Risk of relapse (ROR) was defined as survival until first event of recurrence or death from cancer.<h4>Results</h4>In the pooled stage II data set, ColoPrint identified 63% of patients as low risk with a 5-year ROR of 10%, whereas high-risk patients (37%) had a 5-year ROR of 21%, with a hazard ratio (HR) of 2.16 (p = .004). This remained significant in a multivariate model that included number of lymph nodes retrieved and microsatellite instability. In the T3 microsatellite-stable subgroup (n = 301), ColoPrint classified 59% of patients as low risk with a 5-year ROR of 9.9%. High-risk patients (31%) had a 22.4% ROR (HR: 2.41; p = .005). In contrast, the NCCN clinical high-risk factors were unable to distinguish high- and low-risk patients (15% vs. 13% ROR; p = .55).<h4>Conclusion</h4>ColoPrint significantly improved prognostic accuracy independent of microsatellite status or clinical variables, facilitating the identification of patients at higher risk who might be considered for additional treatment.",0,
24319143,MMDB and VAST+: tracking structural similarities between macromolecular complexes.,"The computational detection of similarities between protein 3D structures has become an indispensable tool for the detection of homologous relationships, the classification of protein families and functional inference. Consequently, numerous algorithms have been developed that facilitate structure comparison, including rapid searches against a steadily growing collection of protein structures. To this end, NCBI's Molecular Modeling Database (MMDB), which is based on the Protein Data Bank (PDB), maintains a comprehensive and up-to-date archive of protein structure similarities computed with the Vector Alignment Search Tool (VAST). These similarities have been recorded on the level of single proteins and protein domains, comprising in excess of 1.5 billion pairwise alignments. Here we present VAST+, an extension to the existing VAST service, which summarizes and presents structural similarity on the level of biological assemblies or macromolecular complexes. VAST+ simplifies structure neighboring results and shows, for macromolecular complexes tracked in MMDB, lists of similar complexes ranked by the extent of similarity. VAST+ replaces the previous VAST service as the default presentation of structure neighboring data in NCBI's Entrez query and retrieval system. MMDB and VAST+ can be accessed via http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/Structure.",1,
34019771,Practice Mediates Bidirectional Dual-Task Interference When Performing a Novel Sequential Nonword Repetition Task.,"Introduction The current study examined the extent to which practice amount mediates dual-task interference patterns associated with concurrent performance of a novel speech task and attention-demanding visuomotor task. Method A Sequential Nonword Repetition Task was used to examine the effect of practice on interference associated with concurrent performance of a Visuomotor Pursuit Task. Twenty-five young adult participants were assigned to either an Extended Practice Group or a Limited Practice Group and performed a novel Sequential Nonword Repetition Task in isolation and while performing a concurrent visuomotor pursuit rotor task. Results Participants in the Limited Practice Group who were afforded a limited amount of practice exhibited dual-task interference (i.e., dual-task performance reductions) for both the speech and visuomotor tasks (i.e., bidirectional dual-task interference). Conversely, participants in the Extended Practice Group who were afforded extended practice exhibited little-to-no observable dual-task interference on the nonword repetition task. Conclusion Data from the current investigation suggest that the amount of initial practice mediates the degree of dual-task interference observed when a novel speech production task is performed with an attention-demanding Visuomotor Pursuit Task.

33693506,COVID-19: disease pathways and gene expression changes predict methylprednisolone can improve outcome in severe cases.,"<h4>Motivation</h4>COVID-19 has several distinct clinical phases: a viral replication phase, an inflammatory phase, and in some patients, a hyper-inflammatory phase. High mortality is associated with patients developing cytokine storm syndrome. Treatment of hyper-inflammation in these patients using existing, approved therapies with proven safety profiles could address the immediate need to reduce mortality.<h4>Results</h4>We analyzed the changes in the gene expression, pathways and putative mechanisms induced by SARS-CoV2 in NHBE, and A549 cells, as well as COVID-19 lung vs. their respective controls. We used these changes to identify FDA approved drugs that could be repurposed to help COVID-19 patients with severe symptoms related to hyper-inflammation. We identified methylprednisolone (MP) as a potential leading therapy. The results were then confirmed in five independent validation data sets including Vero E6 cells, lung and intestinal organoids, as well as additional patient lung sample vs. their respective controls. Finally, the efficacy of MP was validated in an independent clinical study. Thirty-day all-cause mortality occurred at a significantly lower rate in the MP-treated group compared to control group (29.6% vs. 16.6%, p = 0.027). Clinical results confirmed the in silico prediction that MP could improve outcomes in severe cases of COVID-19. A low number needed to treat (NNT = 5) suggests MP may be more efficacious than dexamethasone or hydrocortisone.<h4>Availability</h4>iPathwayGuide is available at https://ipathwayguide.advaitabio.com/.<h4>Supplementary information</h4>Supplementary data are available at Bioinformatics online.",0,

Here, we use the rise of multidrug-resistant <i>K. pneumoniae</i> in a German neurorehabilitation center from April 2015 to April 2016 to dissect the benefit of whole genome sequencing (WGS) for outbreak analyses. In total, 53 isolates were obtained from 52 patients and examined using WGS. Two independent analysis strategies (reference-based and -free) revealed the same distinct clusters of two CTX-M-15 producing <i>K. pneumoniae</i> clones (ST15, <i>n</i> = 31; ST405, <i>n</i> = 7) and one CTX-M-15 producing <i>Klebsiella quasipneumoniae</i> strain (ST414, <i>n</i> = 8). Additionally, we determined sequence variations associated with antimicrobial resistance phenotypes in single isolates expressing carbapenem and colistin resistance, respectively. For rapid detection of the major <i>K. pneumoniae</i> outbreak clone (ST15), a selective triplex PCR was deduced from WGS data of the major outbreak strain and <i>K. pneumoniae</i> genome data deposited in central databases. Moreover, we introduce two novel open-source applications supporting reference genome selection (<i>refRank</i>; https://gitlab.com/s.fuchs/refRank) and alignment-based SNP-filtering (<i>SNPfilter</i>; https://gitlab.com/s.fuchs/snpfilter) in NGS analyses.",0,
22796958,A regression model for estimating DNA copy number applied to capture sequencing data.,"<h4>Motivation</h4>Target enrichment, also referred to as DNA capture, provides an effective way to focus sequencing efforts on a genomic region of interest. Capture data are typically used to detect single-nucleotide variants. It can also be used to detect copy number alterations, which is particularly useful in the context of cancer, where such changes occur frequently. In copy number analysis, it is a common practice to determine log-ratios between test and control samples, but this approach results in a loss of information as it disregards the total coverage or intensity at a locus.<h4>Results</h4>We modeled the coverage or intensity of the test sample as a linear function of the control sample. This regression approach is able to deal with regions that are completely deleted, which are problematic for methods that use log-ratios. To demonstrate the utility of our approach, we used capture data to determine copy number for a set of 600 genes in a panel of nine breast cancer cell lines. We found high concordance between our results and those generated using a single-nucleotide polymorphsim genotyping platform. When we compared our results with other log-ratio-based methods, including ExomeCNV, we found that our approach produced better overall correlation with SNP data.<h4>Availability</h4>The algorithm is implemented in C and R and the code can be downloaded from http://bioinformatics.nki.nl/ocs/<h4>Contact</h4>l.wessels@nki.nl<h4>Supplementary information</h4>Supplementary data are available at Bioinformatics online.",0,
24855436,Polytraits: A database on biological traits of marine polychaetes.,"The study of ecosystem functioning - the role which organisms play in an ecosystem - is becoming increasingly important in marine ecological research. The functional structure of a community can be represented by a set of functional traits assigned to behavioural, reproductive and morphological characteristics. The collection of these traits from the literature is however a laborious and time-consuming process, and gaps of knowledge and restricted availability of literature are a common problem. Trait data are not yet readily being shared by research communities, and even if they are, a lack of trait data repositories and standards for data formats leads to the publication of trait information in forms which cannot be processed by computers. This paper describes Polytraits (http://polytraits.lifewatchgreece.eu), a database on biological traits of marine polychaetes (bristle worms, Polychaeta: Annelida). At present, the database contains almost 20,000 records on morphological, behavioural and reproductive characteristics of more than 1,000 marine polychaete species, all referenced by literature sources.

The database is an important resource, providing GWAS data that can be used for new exploratory research or cross-study validation by authorized users. However, finding studies relevant to a particular phenotype of interest is challenging, as phenotype information is presented in a non-standardized way.

PhenDisco consists of two main components: (1) text processing tools that standardize phenotype variables and study metadata, and (2) information retrieval tools that support queries from users and return ranked results. In a preliminary comparison involving 18 search scenarios, PhenDisco showed promising performance for both unranked and ranked search comparisons with dbGaP's search engine Entrez.

Methods: Affymetrix miR microarray data and GSE56914 data downloaded from GEO database (http: //www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/) were obtained and integrated. The microarray data were obtained from peripheral blood samples of CTEPH patients and the matched control. Differentially expressed miRs were screened. Target genes of these miRs were searched. Then, functional enrichment analyses for these miRs were performed. After that, disease network including miRs, target genes and pathways was constructed. Results: Five important miRs including hsa-miR-885-5p, hsa-miR-501-5p, hsa-miR-615-3p, hsa-miR-610, and hsa-miR-346 were identified. Furthermore, hsa-miR-885-5p and hsa-miR-501-5p were significantly enriched in cell cycle pathway. Hsa-miR-615-3p was involved in cytokine-cytokine receptor interaction, axon guidance, focal adhesion and cell cycle pathway. Hsa-miR-610 was significantly enriched in focal adhesion pathway, and hsa-miR-346 was involved in cytokine-cytokine receptor interaction, axon guidance, and focal adhesion pathway.

29662024,"PKIDB: A Curated, Annotated and Updated Database of Protein Kinase Inhibitors in Clinical Trials.","The number of protein kinase inhibitors (PKIs) approved worldwide continues to grow steadily, with 39 drugs approved in the period between 2001 and January 2018. PKIs on the market have been the subject of many reviews, and structure-property relationships specific to this class of drugs have been inferred. However, the large number of PKIs under development is often overlooked. In this paper, we present PKIDB (Protein Kinase Inhibitor Database), a monthly-updated database gathering approved PKIs as well as PKIs currently in clinical trials. The database compiles currently 180 inhibitors ranging from phase 0 to 4 clinical trials along with annotations extracted from seven public resources. The distribution and property ranges of standard physicochemical properties are presented. They can be used as filters to better prioritize compound selection for future screening campaigns. Interestingly, more than one-third of the kinase inhibitors violate at least one Lipinski's rule. A Principal Component Analysis (PCA) reveals that Type-II inhibitors are mapped to a distinct chemical space as compared to orally administrated drugs as well as to other types of kinase inhibitors. Using a Principal Moment of Inertia (PMI) analysis, we show that PKIs under development tend to explore new shape territories as compared to approved PKIs. In order to facilitate the analysis of the protein space, the kinome tree has been annotated with all protein kinases being targeted by PKIs. Finally, we analyzed the pipeline of the pharmaceutical companies having PKIs on the market or still under development. We hope that this work will assist researchers in the kinase field in identifying and designing the next generation of kinase inhibitors for still untargeted kinases. The PKIDB database is freely accessible from a website at http://www.icoa.fr/pkidb and can be easily browsed through a user-friendly spreadsheet-like interface.",1,
29168754,A Bioinformatic Pipeline for Monitoring of the Mutational Stability of Viral Drug Targets with Deep-Sequencing Technology.,"The efficient development of antiviral drugs, including efficient antiviral small interfering RNAs (siRNAs), requires continuous monitoring of the strict correspondence between a drug and the related highly variable viral DNA/RNA target(s). Deep sequencing is able to provide an assessment of both the general target conservation and the frequency of particular mutations in the different target sites. The aim of this study was to develop a reliable bioinformatic pipeline for the analysis of millions of short, deep sequencing reads corresponding to selected highly variable viral sequences that are drug target(s). The suggested bioinformatic pipeline combines the available programs and the ad hoc scripts based on an original algorithm of the search for the conserved targets in the deep sequencing data. We also present the statistical criteria for the threshold of reliable mutation detection and for the assessment of variations between corresponding data sets. These criteria are robust against the possible sequencing errors in the reads. As an example, the bioinformatic pipeline is applied to the study of the conservation of RNA interference (RNAi) targets in human immunodeficiency virus 1 (HIV-1) subtype A. The developed pipeline is freely available to download at the website http://virmut.eimb.ru/. Brief comments and comparisons between VirMut and other pipelines are also presented.",0,
26115255,Estimation of the environmental dam-offspring correlation in beef cattle.,"A long standing controversy in animal breeding is related to the strong negative estimates of the direct-maternal genetic correlation obtained when fitting data on maternally influenced traits. In this article, we focused on a model that introduces a new correlation parameter among dam-offspring records. The extant theory allows estimation of the parameter when dams have at most a single offspring. Our goal was to develop an inferential procedure in a more general setting. To do so, we applied a Bayesian approach and we showed that the estimation could be accomplished by introducing a Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) step embedded into a regular Gibbs sampler program. The procedure was implemented by means of an MCMC algorithm known as the Griddy-Gibbs sampler, and a Fortran 90 library was created to accomplish the task. The computer program is available from http://www.agro.uba.ar/catedras/mg_animal/software/RDBLK. With this tool at hand, we applied the inferential procedure to weaning weight records on beef cattle calves from an Argentinean Hereford herd, and we estimated the marginal distribution of the environmental dam-offspring correlation parameter. The distribution was unimodal and symmetric with a mean value of -0.14 (±0.03) and a 95% high posterior density interval between -0.20 and -0.07, indicating that the model placed a huge mass on negative values of the parameter. Noticeably, the magnitude of the direct-maternal genetic correlation diminished from -0.61 to -0.37 with respect to the standard maternal animal model. This result reinforces the idea that environmental covariances among dam-offspring records may bias the estimate of the direct-maternal genetic correlation.",0,
25051568,A flexible pinhole camera model for coherent nonuniform sampling.,"The flexible pinhole camera (FPC) allows flexible modulation of the sampling rate over the field of view. The FPC is defined by a viewpoint and a map specifying the sampling locations on the image plane. The map is constructed from known regions of interest with interactive and automatic approaches. The FPC provides inexpensive 3D projection that allows rendering complex datasets quickly, in feed-forward fashion, by projection followed by rasterization. The FPC supports many types of data, including image, height field, geometry, and volume data. The resulting image is a coherent nonuniform sampling (CoNUS) of the dataset that matches the local variation of the dataset's importance. CoNUS images have been successfully implemented for remote visualization, focus-plus-context visualization, and acceleration of expensive rendering effects such as surface geometric detail and specular reflection.

We demonstrate with two validation analyses that these new data support modeling specific properties of the complex natural stimulus, as well as a substantial within-subject BOLD response congruency in brain areas related to the processing of auditory inputs, speech, and narrative when compared to the existing fMRI data for audio-only stimulation. In addition, we provide participants' eye gaze location as recorded simultaneously with fMRI, and an additional sample of 15 control participants whose eye gaze trajectories for the entire movie were recorded in a lab setting-to enable studies on attentional processes and comparative investigations on the potential impact of the stimulation setting on these processes.",1,

22689643,MoNetFamily: a web server to infer homologous modules and module-module interaction networks in vertebrates.,"A module is a fundamental unit forming with highly connected proteins and performs a certain kind of biological functions. Modules and module-module interaction (MMI) network are essential for understanding cellular processes and functions. The MoNetFamily web server can identify the modules, homologous modules (called module family) and MMI networks across multiple species for the query protein(s). This server first finds module candidates of the query by using BLASTP to search the module template database (1785 experimental and 1252 structural templates). MoNetFamily then infers the homologous modules of the selected module candidate using protein-protein interaction (PPI) families. According to homologous modules and PPIs, we statistically calculated MMIs and MMI networks across multiple species. For each module candidate, MoNetFamily identifies its neighboring modules and their MMIs in module networks of Homo sapiens, Mus musculus and Danio rerio. Finally, MoNetFamily shows the conserved proteins, PPI profiles and functional annotations of the module family. Our results indicate that the server can be useful for MMI network (e.g. 1818 modules and 9678 MMIs in H. sapiens) visualizations and query annotations using module families and neighboring modules. We believe that the server is able to provide valuable insights to determine homologous modules and MMI networks across multiple species for studying module evolution and cellular processes.

21590677,Evaluation of the positional difference between two common geocoding methods.,"Geocoding, the process of matching addresses to geographic coordinates, is a necessary first step when using geographical information systems (GIS) technology. However, different geocoding methodologies can result in different geographic coordinates. The objective of this study was to compare the positional (i.e. longitude/latitude) difference between two common geocoding methods, i.e. ArcGIS (Environmental System Research Institute, Redlands, CA, USA) and Batchgeo (freely available online at http://www.batchgeo.com). Address data came from the YMCA-Harvard After School Food and Fitness Project, an obesity prevention intervention involving children aged 5-11 years and their families participating in YMCA-administered, after-school programmes located in four geographically diverse metropolitan areas in the USA. Our analyses include baseline addresses (n = 748) collected from the parents of the children in the after school sites. Addresses were first geocoded to the street level and assigned longitude and latitude coordinates with ArcGIS, version 9.3, then the same addresses were geocoded with Batchgeo. For this analysis, the ArcGIS minimum match score was 80. The resulting geocodes were projected into state plane coordinates, and the difference in longitude and latitude coordinates were calculated in meters between the two methods for all data points in each of the four metropolitan areas. We also quantified the descriptions of the geocoding accuracy provided by Batchgeo with the match scores from ArcGIS. We found a 94% match rate (n = 705), 2% (n = 18) were tied and 3% (n = 25) were unmatched using ArcGIS. Forty-eight addresses (6.4%) were not matched in ArcGIS with a match score =80 (therefore only 700 addresses were included in our positional difference analysis). Six hundred thirteen (87.6%) of these addresses had a match score of 100. Batchgeo yielded a 100% match rate for the addresses that ArcGIS geocoded. The median for longitude and latitude coordinates for all the data was just over 25 m. Overall, the range for longitude was 0.04-12,911.8 m, and the range for latitude was 0.02-37,766.6 m. Comparisons show minimal differences in the median and minimum values, while there were slightly larger differences in the maximum values. The majority (>75%) of the geographic differences were within 50 m of each other; mostly <25 m from each other (about 49%). Only about 4% overall were =400 m apart. We also found geographic differences in the proportion of addresses that fell within certain meter ranges. The match-score range associated with the Batchgeo accuracy level ""approximate"" (least accurate) was 84-100 (mean = 92), while the ""rooftop"" Batchgeo accuracy level (most accurate) delivered a mean of 98.9 but the range was the same. Although future research should compare the positional difference of Batchgeo to criterion measures of longitude/latitude (e.g. with global positioning system measurement), this study suggests that Batchgeo is a good, free-of-charge option to geocode addresses.",0,
28666322,SVM-dependent pairwise HMM: an application to protein pairwise alignments.,"<h4>Motivation</h4>Methods able to provide reliable protein alignments are crucial for many bioinformatics applications. In the last years many different algorithms have been developed and various kinds of information, from sequence conservation to secondary structure, have been used to improve the alignment performances. This is especially relevant for proteins with highly divergent sequences. However, recent works suggest that different features may have different importance in diverse protein classes and it would be an advantage to have more customizable approaches, capable to deal with different alignment definitions.<h4>Results</h4>Here we present Rigapollo, a highly flexible pairwise alignment method based on a pairwise HMM-SVM that can use any type of information to build alignments. Rigapollo lets the user decide the optimal features to align their protein class of interest. It outperforms current state of the art methods on two well-known benchmark datasets when aligning highly divergent sequences.<h4>Availability and implementation</h4>A Python implementation of the algorithm is available at http://ibsquare.be/rigapollo.<h4>Contact</h4>wim.vranken@vub.be.<h4>Supplementary information</h4>Supplementary data are available at Bioinformatics online.",0,
34186186,"In silico modelling of acute toxicity of 1, 2, 4-triazole antifungal agents towards zebrafish (Danio rerio) embryos: Application of the Small Dataset Modeller tool.","Nowadays, there is a widespread use of triazole antifungal agents to kill broad classes of fungi in farming lands and to protect herbs, fruits and grains. These agents further deposit into the aquatic systems causing toxicity to the living aquatic creatures, which can then affect human beings. Considering this issue, risk assessment of these toxic chemicals is a very essential task. Due to the inadequate experimental data on acute toxicity of antifungal agents containing the 1, 2, 4-triazole ring, higher testing costs along with the regulatory restrictions and the international regulations to lessen animal testing emphasize on in silico techniques such as quantitative structure-activity relationship (QSAR) studies. The application of QSAR modelling has created an easier avenue to predict activity/property/toxicity of newly synthesized compounds. In the present study, we have used 23 antifungal agents containing the 1, 2, 4-triazole ring to develop 2D-QSAR models and explored their structural attributes crucial for acute toxicity towards embryonic phase of zebrafish (Danio rerio). Here, we have employed simple 2D descriptors to develop the QSAR models. The models were evolved by executing the Small Dataset Modeller tool (https://dtclab.webs.com/software-tools), and the validation of the models was achieved by employing different precise validation principles. The statistical validation metrics confirm that built models are robust, useful and well predictive to forecast the acute toxicity of new compounds.",0,
26063840,EXIMS: an improved data analysis pipeline based on a new peak picking method for EXploring Imaging Mass Spectrometry data.,"<h4>Motivation</h4>Matrix Assisted Laser Desorption Ionization-Imaging Mass Spectrometry (MALDI-IMS) in 'omics' data acquisition generates detailed information about the spatial distribution of molecules in a given biological sample. Various data processing methods have been developed for exploring the resultant high volume data. However, most of these methods process data in the spectral domain and do not make the most of the important spatial information available through this technology. Therefore, we propose a novel streamlined data analysis pipeline specifically developed for MALDI-IMS data utilizing significant spatial information for identifying hidden significant molecular distribution patterns in these complex datasets.<h4>Methods</h4>The proposed unsupervised algorithm uses Sliding Window Normalization (SWN) and a new spatial distribution based peak picking method developed based on Gray level Co-Occurrence (GCO) matrices followed by clustering of biomolecules. We also use gist descriptors and an improved version of GCO matrices to extract features from molecular images and minimum medoid distance to automatically estimate the number of possible groups.<h4>Results</h4>We evaluated our algorithm using a new MALDI-IMS metabolomics dataset of a plant (Eucalypt) leaf. The algorithm revealed hidden significant molecular distribution patterns in the dataset, which the current Component Analysis and Segmentation Map based approaches failed to extract. We further demonstrate the performance of our peak picking method over other traditional approaches by using a publicly available MALDI-IMS proteomics dataset of a rat brain. Although SWN did not show any significant improvement as compared with using no normalization, the visual assessment showed an improvement as compared to using the median normalization.<h4>Availability and implementation</h4>The source code and sample data are freely available at http://exims.sourceforge.net/.<h4>Contact</h4>awgcdw@student.unimelb.edu.au or chalini_w@live.com<h4>Supplementary information</h4>Supplementary data are available at Bioinformatics online.",0,
33621129,Associations between Blood Lead Levels and Coronary Artery Stenosis Measured Using Coronary Computed Tomography Angiography.,"<h4>Background</h4>Lead exposure is a risk factor for increased blood pressure and cardiovascular disease, even when blood lead levels (BLLs) are within the normal range.<h4>Objective</h4>This study aimed to investigate the association between BLL and coronary artery stenosis (CAS) in asymptomatic adults using 128-slice dual-source coronary computed tomography (CT) angiography.<h4>Methods</h4>We analyzed medical records data from 2,193 adults (1,461 men and 732 women) who elected to complete a screening health examination, coronary CT angiography, and BLL measurement during 2011-2018 and had no history of CAS symptoms, cardiovascular disease, or occupational exposure to lead. Logistic regression models were used to estimate associations between moderate-to-severe CAS (=25% stenosis) and a 1-µg/dL increase in blood lead, with and without adjustment for age, sex, hypertension, diabetes mellitus, dyslipidemia, body mass index, regular exercise, smoking status, and alcohol drinking.<h4>Results</h4>BLLs ranged from 0.12 to 10.14µg/dL, with an arithmetic mean of 2.71±1.26µg/dL. The arithmetic mean was higher for men than for women (2.98±1.26µg/dL vs. 2.18±1.08µg/dL, p<0.001) and higher in the moderate-to-severe CAS group than in the no-CAS or <25% stenosis group (3.02±1.44µg/dL vs. 2.67±1.23µg/dL, p<0.001). Moderate-to-severe CAS was significantly associated with BLL before and after adjustment, with an adjusted odds ratio for a 1-µg/dL increase in BLL of 1.14 (95% CI: 1.02, 1.26), p=0.017.<h4>Conclusions</h4>BLL was positively associated with the prevalence of moderate-to-severe CAS in Korean adults who completed an elective screening examination for early cardiovascular disease, 94% of whom had a BLL of <5µg/dL. More efforts and a strict health policy are needed to further reduce BLLs in the general population. https://doi.org/10.1289/EHP7351.",0,
25541969,Scholarly context not found: one in five articles suffers from reference rot.,"The emergence of the web has fundamentally affected most aspects of information communication, including scholarly communication. The immediacy that characterizes publishing information to the web, as well as accessing it, allows for a dramatic increase in the speed of dissemination of scholarly knowledge. But, the transition from a paper-based to a web-based scholarly communication system also poses challenges. In this paper, we focus on reference rot, the combination of link rot and content drift to which references to web resources included in Science, Technology, and Medicine (STM) articles are subject. We investigate the extent to which reference rot impacts the ability to revisit the web context that surrounds STM articles some time after their publication. We do so on the basis of a vast collection of articles from three corpora that span publication years 1997 to 2012. For over one million references to web resources extracted from over 3.5 million articles, we determine whether the HTTP URI is still responsive on the live web and whether web archives contain an archived snapshot representative of the state the referenced resource had at the time it was referenced. We observe that the fraction of articles containing references to web resources is growing steadily over time. We find one out of five STM articles suffering from reference rot, meaning it is impossible to revisit the web context that surrounds them some time after their publication. When only considering STM articles that contain references to web resources, this fraction increases to seven out of ten. We suggest that, in order to safeguard the long-term integrity of the web-based scholarly record, robust solutions to combat the reference rot problem are required. In conclusion, we provide a brief insight into the directions that are explored with this regard in the context of the Hiberlink project.",0,
21546400,Mixture models for analysis of the taxonomic composition of metagenomes.,"<h4>Motivation</h4>Inferring the taxonomic profile of a microbial community from a large collection of anonymous DNA sequencing reads is a challenging task in metagenomics. Because existing methods for taxonomic profiling of metagenomes are all based on the assignment of fragmentary sequences to phylogenetic categories, the accuracy of results largely depends on fragment length. This dependence complicates comparative analysis of data originating from different sequencing platforms or resulting from different preprocessing pipelines.<h4>Results</h4>We here introduce a new method for taxonomic profiling based on mixture modeling of the overall oligonucleotide distribution of a sample. Our results indicate that the mixture-based profiles compare well with taxonomic profiles obtained with other methods. However, in contrast to the existing methods, our approach shows a nearly constant profiling accuracy across all kinds of read lengths and it operates at an unrivaled speed.<h4>Availability</h4>A platform-independent implementation of the mixture modeling approach is available in terms of a MATLAB/Octave toolbox at http://gobics.de/peter/taxy.

26227548,Simulated unbound structures for benchmarking of protein docking in the DOCKGROUND resource.,"<h4>Background</h4>Proteins play an important role in biological processes in living organisms. Many protein functions are based on interaction with other proteins. The structural information is important for adequate description of these interactions. Sets of protein structures determined in both bound and unbound states are essential for benchmarking of the docking procedures. However, the number of such proteins in PDB is relatively small. A radical expansion of such sets is possible if the unbound structures are computationally simulated.<h4>Results</h4>The DOCKGROUND public resource provides data to improve our understanding of protein-protein interactions and to assist in the development of better tools for structural modeling of protein complexes, such as docking algorithms and scoring functions. A large set of simulated unbound protein structures was generated from the bound structures. The modeling protocol was based on 1 ns Langevin dynamics simulation. The simulated structures were validated on the ensemble of experimentally determined unbound and bound structures. The set is intended for large scale benchmarking of docking algorithms and scoring functions.<h4>Conclusions</h4>A radical expansion of the unbound protein docking benchmark set was achieved by simulating the unbound structures. The simulated unbound structures were selected according to criteria from systematic comparison of experimentally determined bound and unbound structures. The set is publicly available at http://dockground.compbio.ku.edu.",1,

29028266,CircPro: an integrated tool for the identification of circRNAs with protein-coding potential.,"<h4>Summary</h4>Circular RNAs (circRNAs), a novel class of endogenous RNAs, are widespread in eukaryotic cells. Emerging roles in diverse biological processes suggest that circRNA is a promising key player in RNA world. Most circRNAs are generated through back-splicing of pre-mRNAs, forming a covalently closed loop structure with no 5' caps or 3' polyadenylated tails. In addition, most circRNAs were not associated with translating ribosomes, therefore, circRNAs were deemed to be noncoding. However, the latest research findings revealed that some circRNAs could generate proteins in vivo, which expands the landscape of transcriptome and proteome. To gain insights into the new area of circRNA translation, we introduce an integrated tool capable of detecting circRNAs with protein-coding potential from high-throughput sequencing data.<h4>Availability and implementation</h4>CircPro is available at http://bis.zju.edu.cn/CircPro.<h4>Contact</h4>mchen@zju.edu.cn.<h4>Supplementary information</h4>Supplementary data are available at Bioinformatics online.",0,
33186370,Individual and community level factors associated with anemia among children 6-59 months of age in Ethiopia: A further analysis of 2016 Ethiopia demographic and health survey.,"<h4>Background</h4>Anemia is a global public health problem; but its burden is disproportionately borne among children in the African Regions. The 2016 Ethiopia Demographic and Health Survey report showed that the prevalence of anemia among children 6-59 months of age was 57%; far exceeding the national target of 25% set for 2015. Although studies have been conducted in Ethiopia, multilevel analysis has rarely been used to identify factors associated with anemia among children. Therefore, this study aimed to identify individual and community-level factors associated with anemia among children 6-59 months of age by fitting a multilevel logistic regression model.<h4>Methods</h4>The data was obtained from the 2016 Ethiopia Demographic and Health Survey, conducted from January to June 2016, and downloaded from the website http://www.DHSprogram.com. The sample was taken using two-stage stratified sampling. In stage one, 645 Enumeration Areas and in stage two 28 households per Enumeration Area were selected. A sample of 7790 children 6-59 months of age was included. Data were analyzed using STATA version 14. A multilevel logistic regression model was fitted and an adjusted odds ratio with a 95% confidence interval was obtained.<h4>Result</h4>From the individual-level factors, anemia was associated most strongly with child age, wealth index, maternal anemia and child stunting followed by child underweight, child fever and birth order whereas from the community-level, the strongest odds of anemia occurred among children from Somali, Harari, Dire Dawa and Afar region followed by Oromia and Addis Ababa. Low community-poverty is a protective factor for anemia. The odds of anemia were 0.81 (95% CI: 0.66, 0.99) times lower for children who were living in communities of lower poverty status than children who were living in communities of higher poverty status. Children from Somali and Dire Dawa had 3.38 (95% CI: 3.25, 5.07) and 2.22 (95% CI: 1.42, 3.48) times higher odds of anemia, respectively than children from the Tigray region.<h4>Conclusions</h4>This study shows that anemia among children 6-59 months of age is affected both by the individual and community level factors. It is better to strengthen the strategies of early detection and management of stunted and underweight children. At the same time, interventions should be strengthened to address maternal anemia, child fever and poverty, specifically targeting regions identified to have a high risk of anemia.",0,
23975194,A modular framework for gene set analysis integrating multilevel omics data.,"Modern high-throughput methods allow the investigation of biological functions across multiple 'omics' levels. Levels include mRNA and protein expression profiling as well as additional knowledge on, for example, DNA methylation and microRNA regulation. The reason for this interest in multi-omics is that actual cellular responses to different conditions are best explained mechanistically when taking all omics levels into account. To map gene products to their biological functions, public ontologies like Gene Ontology are commonly used. Many methods have been developed to identify terms in an ontology, overrepresented within a set of genes. However, these methods are not able to appropriately deal with any combination of several data types. Here, we propose a new method to analyse integrated data across multiple omics-levels to simultaneously assess their biological meaning. We developed a model-based Bayesian method for inferring interpretable term probabilities in a modular framework. Our Multi-level ONtology Analysis (MONA) algorithm performed significantly better than conventional analyses of individual levels and yields best results even for sophisticated models including mRNA fine-tuning by microRNAs. The MONA framework is flexible enough to allow for different underlying regulatory motifs or ontologies. It is ready-to-use for applied researchers and is available as a standalone application from http://icb.helmholtz-muenchen.de/mona.",0,

Currently, it is possible to visualize high-throughput data on top of pre-defined network layouts, but they are not always adapted to a given data analysis task. A network layout based simultaneously on the network structure and the associated multidimensional data might be advantageous for data visualization and analysis in some cases.<h4>Results</h4>We developed a Cytoscape app, which allows constructing biological network layouts based on the data from molecular profiles imported as values of node attributes. DeDaL is a Cytoscape 3 app, which uses linear and non-linear algorithms of dimension reduction to produce data-driven network layouts based on multidimensional data (typically gene expression). DeDaL implements several data pre-processing and layout post-processing steps such as continuous morphing between two arbitrary network layouts and aligning one network layout with respect to another one by rotating and mirroring. The combination of all these functionalities facilitates the creation of insightful network layouts representing both structural network features and correlation patterns in multivariate data. We demonstrate the added value of applying DeDaL in several practical applications, including an example of a large protein-protein interaction network.<h4>Conclusions</h4>DeDaL is a convenient tool for applying data dimensionality reduction methods and for designing insightful data displays based on data-driven layouts of biological networks, built within Cytoscape environment.

28130241,Classification of RNA structure change by 'gazing' at experimental data.,"<h4>Motivation</h4>Mutations (or Single Nucleotide Variants) in folded RiboNucleic Acid structures that cause local or global conformational change are riboSNitches. Predicting riboSNitches is challenging, as it requires making two, albeit related, structure predictions. The data most often used to experimentally validate riboSNitch predictions is Selective 2' Hydroxyl Acylation by Primer Extension, or SHAPE. Experimentally establishing a riboSNitch requires the quantitative comparison of two SHAPE traces: wild-type (WT) and mutant. Historically, SHAPE data was collected on electropherograms and change in structure was evaluated by 'gel gazing.' SHAPE data is now routinely collected with next generation sequencing and/or capillary sequencers. We aim to establish a classifier capable of simulating human 'gazing' by identifying features of the SHAPE profile that human experts agree 'looks' like a riboSNitch.<h4>Results</h4>We find strong quantitative agreement between experts when RNA scientists 'gaze' at SHAPE data and identify riboSNitches. We identify dynamic time warping and seven other features predictive of the human consensus. The classSNitch classifier reported here accurately reproduces human consensus for 167 mutant/WT comparisons with an Area Under the Curve (AUC) above 0.8. When we analyze 2019 mutant traces for 17 different RNAs, we find that features of the WT SHAPE reactivity allow us to improve thermodynamic structure predictions of riboSNitches. This is significant, as accurate RNA structural analysis and prediction is likely to become an important aspect of precision medicine.<h4>Availability and implementation</h4>The classSNitch R package is freely available at http://classsnitch.r-forge.r-project.org .<h4>Contact</h4>alain@email.unc.edu.<h4>Supplementary information</h4>Supplementary data are available at Bioinformatics online.",0,
21985277,A model-based circular binary segmentation algorithm for the analysis of array CGH data.,"<h4>Background</h4>Circular Binary Segmentation (CBS) is a permutation-based algorithm for array Comparative Genomic Hybridization (aCGH) data analysis. CBS accurately segments data by detecting change-points using a maximal-t test; but extensive computational burden is involved for evaluating the significance of change-points using permutations. A recent implementation utilizing a hybrid method and early stopping rules (hybrid CBS) to improve the performance in speed was subsequently proposed. However, a time analysis revealed that a major portion of computation time of the hybrid CBS was still spent on permutation. In addition, what the hybrid method provides is an approximation of the significance upper bound or lower bound, not an approximation of the significance of change-points itself.<h4>Results</h4>We developed a novel model-based algorithm, extreme-value based CBS (eCBS), which limits permutations and provides robust results without loss of accuracy. Thousands of aCGH data under null hypothesis were simulated in advance based on a variety of non-normal assumptions, and the corresponding maximal-t distribution was modeled by the Generalized Extreme Value (GEV) distribution. The modeling results, which associate characteristics of aCGH data to the GEV parameters, constitute lookup tables (eXtreme model). Using the eXtreme model, the significance of change-points could be evaluated in a constant time complexity through a table lookup process.<h4>Conclusions</h4>A novel algorithm, eCBS, was developed in this study. The current implementation of eCBS consistently outperforms the hybrid CBS 4◊ to 20◊ in computation time without loss of accuracy.

29178193,Proteomic Characterization of Caenorhabditis elegans Larval Development.,"The nematode Caenorhabditis elegans is widely used as a model organism to study cell and developmental biology. Quantitative proteomics of C. elegans is still in its infancy and, so far, most studies have been performed on adult worm samples. Here, we used quantitative mass spectrometry to characterize protein level changes across the four larval developmental stages (L1-L4) of C. elegans. In total, we identified 4130 proteins, and quantified 1541 proteins that were present across all four stages in three biological replicates from independent experiments. Using hierarchical clustering and functional ontological analyses, we identified 21 clusters containing proteins with similar protein profiles across the four stages, and highlighted the most overrepresented biological functions in each of these protein clusters. In addition, we used the dataset to identify putative larval stage-specific proteins in each individual developmental stage, as well as in the early and late developmental stages. In summary, this dataset provides system-wide analysis of protein level changes across the four C. elegans larval developmental stages, which serves as a useful resource for the C. elegans research community.

27447888,MBMC: An Effective Markov Chain Approach for Binning Metagenomic Reads from Environmental Shotgun Sequencing Projects.,"Metagenomics is a next-generation omics field currently impacting postgenomic life sciences and medicine. Binning metagenomic reads is essential for the understanding of microbial function, compositions, and interactions in given environments. Despite the existence of dozens of computational methods for metagenomic read binning, it is still very challenging to bin reads. This is especially true for reads from unknown species, from species with similar abundance, and/or from low-abundance species in environmental samples. In this study, we developed a novel taxonomy-dependent and alignment-free approach called MBMC (Metagenomic Binning by Markov Chains). Different from all existing methods, MBMC bins reads by measuring the similarity of reads to the trained Markov chains for different taxa instead of directly comparing reads with known genomic sequences. By testing on more than 24 simulated and experimental datasets with species of similar abundance, species of low abundance, and/or unknown species, we report here that MBMC reliably grouped reads from different species into separate bins. Compared with four existing approaches, we demonstrated that the performance of MBMC was comparable with existing approaches when binning reads from sequenced species, and superior to existing approaches when binning reads from unknown species. MBMC is a pivotal tool for binning metagenomic reads in the current era of Big Data and postgenomic integrative biology.

27895719,DRABAL: novel method to mine large high-throughput screening assays using Bayesian active learning.,"<h4>Background</h4>Mining high-throughput screening (HTS) assays is key for enhancing decisions in the area of drug repositioning and drug discovery. However, many challenges are encountered in the process of developing suitable and accurate methods for extracting useful information from these assays. Virtual screening and a wide variety of databases, methods and solutions proposed to-date, did not completely overcome these challenges. This study is based on a multi-label classification (MLC) technique for modeling correlations between several HTS assays, meaning that a single prediction represents a subset of assigned correlated labels instead of one label. Thus, the devised method provides an increased probability for more accurate predictions of compounds that were not tested in particular assays.<h4>Results</h4>Here we present DRABAL, a novel MLC solution that incorporates structure learning of a Bayesian network as a step to model dependency between the HTS assays. In this study, DRABAL was used to process more than 1.4 million interactions of over 400,000 compounds and analyze the existing relationships between five large HTS assays from the PubChem BioAssay Database. Compared to different MLC methods, DRABAL significantly improves the F<sub>1</sub>Score by about 22%, on average. We further illustrated usefulness and utility of DRABAL through screening FDA approved drugs and reported ones that have a high probability to interact with several targets, thus enabling drug-multi-target repositioning. Specifically DRABAL suggests the Thiabendazole drug as a common activator of the NCP1 and Rab-9A proteins, both of which are designed to identify treatment modalities for the Niemann-Pick type C disease.<h4>Conclusion</h4>We developed a novel MLC solution based on a Bayesian active learning framework to overcome the challenge of lacking fully labeled training data and exploit actual dependencies between the HTS assays. The solution is motivated by the need to model dependencies between existing experimental confirmatory HTS assays and improve prediction performance. We have pursued extensive experiments over several HTS assays and have shown the advantages of DRABAL.

23411718,The Eimeria transcript DB: an integrated resource for annotated transcripts of protozoan parasites of the genus Eimeria.,"Parasites of the genus Eimeria infect a wide range of vertebrate hosts, including chickens. We have recently reported a comparative analysis of the transcriptomes of Eimeria acervulina, Eimeria maxima and Eimeria tenella, integrating ORESTES data produced by our group and publicly available Expressed Sequence Tags (ESTs). All cDNA reads have been assembled, and the reconstructed transcripts have been submitted to a comprehensive functional annotation pipeline. Additional studies included orthology assignment across apicomplexan parasites and clustering analyses of gene expression profiles among different developmental stages of the parasites. To make all this body of information publicly available, we constructed the Eimeria Transcript Database (EimeriaTDB), a web repository that provides access to sequence data, annotation and comparative analyses. Here, we describe the web interface, available sequence data sets and query tools implemented on the site. The main goal of this work is to offer a public repository of sequence and functional annotation data of reconstructed transcripts of parasites of the genus Eimeria. We believe that EimeriaTDB will represent a valuable and complementary resource for the Eimeria scientific community and for those researchers interested in comparative genomics of apicomplexan parasites.

26204236,MI-PVT: A Tool for Visualizing the Chromosome-Centric Human Proteome.,"We have developed the web-based Michigan Proteome Visualization Tool (MI-PVT) to visualize and compare protein expression and isoform-level function across human chromosomes and tissues (http://guanlab.ccmb.med.umich.edu/mipvt). As proof of principle, we have populated the tool with Human Proteome Map (HPM) data. We were able to observe many biologically interesting features. From the vantage point of our chromosome 17 team, for example, we found more than 300 proteins from chromosome 17 expressed in each of the 30 tissues and cell types studied, with the highest number of expressed proteins being 685 in testis. Comparisons of expression levels across tissues showed low numbers of proteins expressed in esophagus, but esophagus had 12 cytoskeletal proteins coded on chromosome 17 with very high expression (>1000 spectral counts). This customized MI-PVT should be helpful for biologists to browse and study specific proteins and protein data sets across tissues and chromosomes. Users can upload any data of interest in MI-PVT for visualization. Our aim is to integrate extensive mass-spectrometric proteomic data into the tool to facilitate finding chromosome-centric protein expression and correlation across tissues.",0,
22102771,EuDBase: An online resource for automated EST analysis pipeline (ESTFrontier) and database for red seaweed Eucheuma denticulatum.,"Functional genomics has proven to be an efficient tool in identifying genes involved in various biological functions. However the availability of commercially important seaweed Eucheuma denticulatum functional resources is still limited. EuDBase is the first seaweed online repository that provides integrated access to ESTs of Eucheuma denticulatum generated from samples collected from Kudat and Semporna in Sabah, Malaysia. The database stored 10,031 ESTs that are clustered and assembled into 2,275 unique transcripts (UT) and 955 singletons. Raw data were automatically processed using ESTFrontier, an in-house automated EST analysis pipeline. Data was collected in MySQL database. Web interface is implemented using PHP and it allows browsing and querying EuDBase through search engine. Data is searchable via BLAST hit, domain search, Gene Ontology or KEGG Pathway. A user-friendly interface allows the identification of sequences either using a simple text query or similarity search. The development of EuDBase is initiated to store, manage and analyze the E. denticulatum ESTs and to provide accumulative digital resources for the use of global scientific community.

21435986,A potential causal association mining algorithm for screening adverse drug reactions in postmarketing surveillance.,"Early detection of unknown adverse drug reactions (ADRs) in postmarketing surveillance saves lives and prevents harmful consequences. We propose a novel data mining approach to signaling potential ADRs from electronic health databases. More specifically, we introduce potential causal association rules (PCARs) to represent the potential causal relationship between a drug and ICD-9 (CDC. (2010). International Classification of Diseases, Ninth Revision (ICD-9). [Online]. Available: http://www.cdc.gov/nchs/icd/icd9.html) coded signs or symptoms representing potential ADRs. Due to the infrequent nature of ADRs, the existing frequency-based data mining methods cannot effectively discover PCARs. We introduce a new interestingness measure, potential causal leverage, to quantify the degree of association of a PCAR. This measure is based on the computational, experience-based fuzzy recognition-primed decision (RPD) model that we developed previously (Y. Ji, R. M. Massanari, J. Ager, J. Yen, R. E. Miller, and H. Ying, ""A fuzzy logic-based computational recognition-primed decision model,"" Inf. Sci., vol. 177, pp. 4338-4353, 2007) on the basis of the well-known, psychology-originated qualitative RPD model (G. A. Klein, ""A recognition-primed decision making model of rapid decision making,"" in Decision Making in Action: Models and Methods, 1993, pp. 138-147). The potential causal leverage assesses the strength of the association of a drug-symptom pair given a collection of patient cases. To test our data mining approach, we retrieved electronic medical data for 16,206 patients treated by one or more than eight drugs of our interest at the Veterans Affairs Medical Center in Detroit between 2007 and 2009. We selected enalapril as the target drug for this ADR signal generation study. We used our algorithm to preliminarily evaluate the associations between enalapril and all the ICD-9 codes associated with it. The experimental results indicate that our approach has a potential to better signal potential ADRs than risk ratio and leverage, two traditional frequency-based measures. Among the top 50 signal pairs (i.e., enalapril versus symptoms) ranked by the potential causal-leverage measure, the physicians on the project determined that eight of them probably represent true causal associations.",0,
21226895,Shape-based peak identification for ChIP-Seq.,"<h4>Background</h4>The identification of binding targets for proteins using ChIP-Seq has gained popularity as an alternative to ChIP-chip. Sequencing can, in principle, eliminate artifacts associated with microarrays, and cheap sequencing offers the ability to sequence deeply and obtain a comprehensive survey of binding. A number of algorithms have been developed to call ""peaks"" representing bound regions from mapped reads. Most current algorithms incorporate multiple heuristics, and despite much work it remains difficult to accurately determine individual peaks corresponding to distinct binding events.<h4>Results</h4>Our method for identifying statistically significant peaks from read coverage is inspired by the notion of persistence in topological data analysis and provides a non-parametric approach that is statistically sound and robust to noise in experiments. Specifically, our method reduces the peak calling problem to the study of tree-based statistics derived from the data. We validate our approach using previously published data and show that it can discover previously missed regions.<h4>Conclusions</h4>The difficulty in accurately calling peaks for ChIP-Seq data is partly due to the difficulty in defining peaks, and we demonstrate a novel method that improves on the accuracy of previous methods in resolving peaks. Our introduction of a robust statistical test based on ideas from topological data analysis is also novel. Our methods are implemented in a program called T-PIC (Tree shape Peak Identification for ChIP-Seq) is available at http://bio.math.berkeley.edu/tpic/.",0,

To cope with these computer science demands, biomedical software engineers are adopting emerging semantic web technologies that better suit the life sciences domain. The latter's complex relationships are easily mapped into semantic web graphs, enabling a superior understanding of collected knowledge. Despite increased awareness of semantic web technologies in bioinformatics, their use is still limited.<h4>Results</h4>COEUS is a new semantic web framework, aiming at a streamlined application development cycle and following a ""semantic web in a box"" approach. The framework provides a single package including advanced data integration and triplification tools, base ontologies, a web-oriented engine and a flexible exploration API. Resources can be integrated from heterogeneous sources, including CSV and XML files or SQL and SPARQL query results, and mapped directly to one or more ontologies. Advanced interoperability features include REST services, a SPARQL endpoint and LinkedData publication. These enable the creation of multiple applications for web, desktop or mobile environments, and empower a new knowledge federation layer.<h4>Conclusions</h4>The platform, targeted at biomedical application developers, provides a complete skeleton ready for rapid application deployment, enhancing the creation of new semantic information systems.

23161672,APPRIS: annotation of principal and alternative splice isoforms.,"Here, we present APPRIS (http://appris.bioinfo.cnio.es), a database that houses annotations of human splice isoforms. APPRIS has been designed to provide value to manual annotations of the human genome by adding reliable protein structural and functional data and information from cross-species conservation. The visual representation of the annotations provided by APPRIS for each gene allows annotators and researchers alike to easily identify functional changes brought about by splicing events. In addition to collecting, integrating and analyzing reliable predictions of the effect of splicing events, APPRIS also selects a single reference sequence for each gene, here termed the principal isoform, based on the annotations of structure, function and conservation for each transcript. APPRIS identifies a principal isoform for 85% of the protein-coding genes in the GENCODE 7 release for ENSEMBL. Analysis of the APPRIS data shows that at least 70% of the alternative (non-principal) variants would lose important functional or structural information relative to the principal isoform.",1,

This review details sex differences from animal and human studies in the function of HPA axis elements (glucocorticoids, corticotropin releasing factor, and vasopressin) and related compounds tested as candidate antidepressants. We propose that sex differences contribute to the failure of novel HPA axis-based drugs in clinical trials. Compounds studied preclinically in males were tested in clinical trials that recruited more, if not exclusively, women, and did not control, but rather adjusted, for potential sex differences. Indeed, clinical trials of antidepressants are usually not stratified by sex or other important factors, although preclinical and epidemiological data support such stratification. In conclusion, we suggest that clinical testing of HPA axis-related compounds creates an opportunity for targeted, personalized antidepressant treatments based on sex.

23178820,MicrobPad MD: microbial pathogen diagnostic methods database.,"Medical pathogens induce infections, illnesses and sometimes serious medical conditions in the infected hosts. Diagnosis of these pathogens is important for proper treatment and investigation of pathogenesis processes. Molecular techniques have been developed for facilitating accurate, sensitive and low-cost diagnosis of these pathogens. Based on these techniques, diagnostic devices have been developed for a number of pathogens. More devices are needed for comprehensive coverage of medical pathogens. To facilitate the development of these devices, a database with integrated information about diagnostic methods, targets, and primers/probes for the known bacterial, fungal and viral pathogens is needed.

The aim of this study was to validate the predictive value of a web-based recurrence risk estimator (RRE; http://www.nmr.mgh.harvard.edu/RRE/) of TSI.<h4>Methods</h4>Data from the prospective hospital-based TIA database of the First Affiliated Hospital of Zhengzhou University were analyzed. The RRE and ABCD2 scores were calculated within 7 days of symptom onset. The predictive outcome was ischemic stroke occurrence at 90 days. The receiver-operating characteristics curves were plotted, and the predictive value of the two models was assessed by computing the C statistics.<h4>Results</h4>A total of 221 eligible patients were prospectively enrolled, of whom 46 (20.81%) experienced a stroke within 90 days. The 90-day stroke risk in high-risk TSI patients (RRE =4) was 3.406-fold greater than in those at low risk (P <0.001). The C statistic of RRE (0.681; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.592-0.771) was statistically higher than that of ABCD2 score (0.546; 95% CI, 0.454-0.638; Z = 2.115; P = 0.0344) at 90 days.<h4>Conclusion</h4>The RRE score had a higher predictive value than the ABCD2 score for assessing the 90-day risk of stroke after TSI.",0,
32166213,Machine learning with force-field inspired descriptors for materials: fast screening and mapping energy landscape.,"We present a complete set of chemo-structural descriptors to significantly extend the applicability of machine-learning (ML) in material screening and mapping energy landscape for multicomponent systems. These new descriptors allow differentiating between structural prototypes, which is not possible using the commonly used chemical-only descriptors. Specifically, we demonstrate that the combination of pairwise radial, nearest neighbor, bond-angle, dihedral-angle and core-charge distributions plays an important role in predicting formation energies, bandgaps, static refractive indices, magnetic properties, and modulus of elasticity for three-dimensional (3D) materials as well as exfoliation energies of two-dimensional (2D) layered materials. The training data consists of 24549 bulk and 616 monolayer materials taken from JARVIS-DFT database. We obtained very accurate ML models using gradient boosting algorithm. Then we use the trained models to discover exfoliable 2D-layered materials satisfying specific property requirements. Additionally, we integrate our formation energy ML model with a genetic algorithm for structure search to verify if the ML model reproduces the DFT convex hull. This verification establishes a more stringent evaluation metric for the ML model than what commonly used in data sciences. Our learnt model is publicly available on the JARVIS-ML website (https://www.ctcms.nist.gov/jarvisml) property predictions of generalized materials.",0,

This study attempts to find a possible lead compound backbone from TCM Database@Taiwan ( http://tcm.cmu.edu.tw/ ) for EGFR, Her2, and UROD proteins against head and neck cancer using computational techniques. Possible traditional Chinese medicine (TCM) lead compounds had potential binding affinities with EGFR, Her2, and UROD proteins. The candidates formed stable interactions with residues Arg803, Thr854 in EGFR, residues Thr862, Asp863 in Her2 protein, and residues Arg37, Arg41 in UROD protein, which are key residues in the binding or catalytic domain of EGFR, Her2, and UROD proteins.

28698795,Semi-automated Modular Program Constructor for physiological modeling: Building cell and organ models.,"The Modular Program Constructor (MPC) is an open-source Java based modeling utility, built upon JSim's Mathematical Modeling Language (MML) ( http://www.physiome.org/jsim/) that uses directives embedded in model code to construct larger, more complicated models quickly and with less error than manually combining models. A major obstacle in writing complex models for physiological processes is the large amount of time it takes to model the myriad processes taking place simultaneously in cells, tissues, and organs. MPC replaces this task with code-generating algorithms that take model code from several different existing models and produce model code for a new JSim model. This is particularly useful during multi-scale model development where many variants are to be configured and tested against data. MPC encodes and preserves information about how a model is built from its simpler model modules, allowing the researcher to quickly substitute or update modules for hypothesis testing. MPC is implemented in Java and requires JSim to use its output. MPC source code and documentation are available at http://www.physiome.org/software/MPC/.",0,
29983907,Rapid onset of action and reduced nasal hyperreactivity: new targets in allergic rhinitis management.,"<h4>Background</h4>This article summarizes a EUFOREA symposium, presented during the European Rhinology Research Forum in Brussels (9-10 November 2017; https://www.rhinologyresearch.eu/) which focused on novel pathways and therapeutic approaches in allergic rhinitis (AR).<h4>Main body</h4>AR remains under-diagnosed, under-estimated and under-treated. A key component in understanding the AR landscape has been the realization of a significant mismatch between how physicians instruct AR patients to manage their disease and what AR patients actually do in real life. Data from the <i>Allergy Diary</i> (developed by MACVIA ARIA) showed that AR patients take their medication prn, rapidly switch treatments, often experience poor control, use multiple therapies and stop treatment when symptoms are controlled. Better control of AR may be achievable by using an AR treatment which has a rapid onset of action and which effectively targets breakthrough symptoms. Indeed, AR patients report complete symptom relief, lack of breakthrough symptoms, rapid onset of action, safety and use on an 'as needed' basis as key targets for new nasal sprays. MP-AzeFlu comprises intranasal azelastine and fluticasone propionate (FP) in a novel formulation delivered in a single device. It is the first AR treatment to break the 5†min onset of action threshold and provides clinically relevant symptom relief in 15†min, much faster than that noted for FP + oral loratadine. MP-AzeFlu also significantly reduces nasal hyperresponsiveness (NHR) which may be responsible for the breakthrough symptoms frequently reported by AR patients. Mechanisms underlying MP-AzeFlu's effect include inhibition of mast cell degranulation, stabilization of the mucosal barrier, synergistic inhibition of inflammatory cell recruitment and a unique desensitization of sensory neurons expressing the transient receptor potential A1 and V1 channels.<h4>Conclusion</h4>With the most rapid onset of action and onset of clinically-relevant effect of any AR medication currently available, and proven efficacy in the treatment of NHR, MP-AzeFlu is an AR treatment which provides what patients want, and fits how patients manage their AR in real life.",0,

However, the increasing number of bioactive peptide databases is causing the problem of data redundancy and duplicated efforts. Even worse is the fact that the available data is non-standardized and often dirty with data entry errors.

These variable clinical manifestations suggest differences in influential factors, such as innate and adaptive host immunity, existing or underlying health conditions, comorbidities, genetics and other factors-compounding the complexity of COVID-19 pathobiology and potential biomarkers associated with the disease, as they become available. The heterogeneous data pose challenges for efficient extrapolation of information into clinical applications. We have curated 145 COVID-19 biomarkers by developing a novel cross-cutting disease biomarker data model that allows integration and evaluation of biomarkers in patients with comorbidities. Most biomarkers are related to the immune (SAA, TNF-<U+221D> and IP-10) or coagulation (D-dimer, antithrombin and VWF) cascades, suggesting complex vascular pathobiology of the disease. Furthermore, we observe commonality with established cancer biomarkers (ACE2, IL-6, IL-4 and IL-2) as well as biomarkers for metabolic syndrome and diabetes (CRP, NLR and LDL).

23151233,PolySac3DB: an annotated data base of 3 dimensional structures of polysaccharides.,"<h4>Background</h4>Polysaccharides are ubiquitously present in the living world. Their structural versatility makes them important and interesting components in numerous biological and technological processes ranging from structural stabilization to a variety of immunologically important molecular recognition events. The knowledge of polysaccharide three-dimensional (3D) structure is important in studying carbohydrate-mediated host-pathogen interactions, interactions with other bio-macromolecules, drug design and vaccine development as well as material science applications or production of bio-ethanol.<h4>Description</h4>PolySac3DB is an annotated database that contains the 3D structural information of 157 polysaccharide entries that have been collected from an extensive screening of scientific literature. They have been systematically organized using standard names in the field of carbohydrate research into 18 categories representing polysaccharide families. Structure-related information includes the saccharides making up the repeat unit(s) and their glycosidic linkages, the expanded 3D representation of the repeat unit, unit cell dimensions and space group, helix type, diffraction diagram(s) (when applicable), experimental and/or simulation methods used for structure description, link to the abstract of the publication, reference and the atomic coordinate files for visualization and download. The database is accompanied by a user-friendly graphical user interface (GUI). It features interactive displays of polysaccharide structures and customized search options for beginners and experts, respectively. The site also serves as an information portal for polysaccharide structure determination techniques. The web-interface also references external links where other carbohydrate-related resources are available.<h4>Conclusion</h4>PolySac3DB is established to maintain information on the detailed 3D structures of polysaccharides.

21708002,A mutation degree model for the identification of transcriptional regulatory elements.,"<h4>Background</h4>Current approaches for identifying transcriptional regulatory elements are mainly via the combination of two properties, the evolutionary conservation and the overrepresentation of functional elements in the promoters of co-regulated genes. Despite the development of many motif detection algorithms, the discovery of conserved motifs in a wide range of phylogenetically related promoters is still a challenge, especially for the short motifs embedded in distantly related gene promoters or very closely related promoters, or in the situation that there are not enough orthologous genes available.<h4>Results</h4>A mutation degree model is proposed and a new word counting method is developed for the identification of transcriptional regulatory elements from a set of co-expressed genes. The new method comprises two parts: 1) identifying overrepresented oligo-nucleotides in promoters of co-expressed genes, 2) estimating the conservation of the oligo-nucleotides in promoters of phylogenetically related genes by the mutation degree model. Compared with the performance of other algorithms, our method shows the advantages of low false positive rate and higher specificity, especially the robustness to noisy data. Applying the method to co-expressed gene sets from Arabidopsis, most of known cis-elements were successfully detected. The tool and example are available at http://mcube.nju.edu.cn/jwang/lab/soft/ocw/OCW.html.<h4>Conclusions</h4>The mutation degree model proposed in this paper is adapted to phylogenetic data of different qualities, and to a wide range of evolutionary distances. The new word-counting method based on this model has the advantage of better performance in detecting short sequence of cis-elements from co-expressed genes of eukaryotes and is robust to less complete phylogenetic data.",0,
23851377,CoLIde: a bioinformatics tool for CO-expression-based small RNA Loci Identification using high-throughput sequencing data.,"Small RNAs (sRNAs) are 20-25 nt non-coding RNAs that act as guides for the highly sequence-specific regulatory mechanism known as RNA silencing. Due to the recent increase in sequencing depth, a highly complex and diverse population of sRNAs in both plants and animals has been revealed. However, the exponential increase in sequencing data has also made the identification of individual sRNA transcripts corresponding to biological units (sRNA loci) more challenging when based exclusively on the genomic location of the constituent sRNAs, hindering existing approaches to identify sRNA loci. To infer the location of significant biological units, we propose an approach for sRNA loci detection called CoLIde (Co-expression based sRNA Loci Identification) that combines genomic location with the analysis of other information such as variation in expression levels (expression pattern) and size class distribution. For CoLIde, we define a locus as a union of regions sharing the same pattern and located in close proximity on the genome. Biological relevance, detected through the analysis of size class distribution, is also calculated for each locus. CoLIde can be applied on ordered (e.g., time-dependent) or un-ordered (e.g., organ, mutant) series of samples both with or without biological/technical replicates. The method reliably identifies known types of loci and shows improved performance on sequencing data from both plants (e.g., A. thaliana, S. lycopersicum) and animals (e.g., D. melanogaster) when compared with existing locus detection techniques.

34007002,Severity modeling of propionic acidemia using clinical and laboratory biomarkers.,"<h4>Purpose</h4>To conduct a proof-of-principle study to identify subtypes of propionic acidemia (PA) and associated biomarkers.<h4>Methods</h4>Data from a clinically diverse PA patient population ( https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT02890342 ) were used to train and test machine learning models, identify PA-relevant biomarkers, and perform validation analysis using data from liver-transplanted participants. k-Means clustering was used to test for the existence of PA subtypes. Expert knowledge was used to define PA subtypes (mild and severe). Given expert classification, supervised machine learning (support vector machine with a polynomial kernel, svmPoly) performed dimensional reduction to define relevant features of each PA subtype.<h4>Results</h4>Forty participants enrolled in the study; five underwent liver transplant. Analysis with k-means clustering indicated that several PA subtypes may exist on the biochemical continuum. The conventional PA biomarkers, plasma total 2-methylctirate and propionylcarnitine, were not statistically significantly different between nontransplanted and transplanted participants motivating us to search for other biomarkers. Unbiased dimensional reduction using svmPoly revealed that plasma transthyretin, alanine:serine ratio, GDF15, FGF21, and in vivo 1-<sup>13</sup>C-propionate oxidation, play roles in defining PA subtypes.<h4>Conclusion</h4>Support vector machine prioritized biomarkers that helped classify propionic acidemia patients according to severity subtypes, with important ramifications for future clinical trials and management of PA.",0,
30722515,"First Report of Globisporangium ultimum Causing Pythium Damping-Off on Aleppo Pine in Algeria, Africa, and the Mediterranean Region.","Globisporangium ultimum (Trow) Uzuhashi, Tojo & Kakish. (syn. Pythium ultimum Trow, syn. P. ultimum Trow var. ultimum) is a known oomycetal species from Pythium s.l. causing damping-off and/or root rot on a great variety of plants throughout the world, including some pine species (Pinus L.) and conifers (2,3). Aleppo pine (Pinus halepensis Mill.) is a common native forest tree in the Mediterranean region. Pre- and post-emergence damping-off disease symptoms were observed during 2008 and 2009 in four forest nurseries from northwestern Algeria (Relizane, Sidi Belabes, and Tlemcen departments). This disease occurred under cool conditions, and Aleppo pines were significantly affected, reducing seedling emergence. Disinfected segments, about 5 mm in length, from decayed root and collar, were cultured on CMA at 25∞C. This oomycetal species was identified based on the species description in Pythium keys (3,4). For the molecular identification, PCR was used to amplify the ITS region of Pythium isolates. It was amplified with the flanking primers ITS1 and ITS4, and these products were directly sequenced. Sequence data were compared to known sequences deposited in the NCBI non redundant database to confirm morphological identification. A BLAST search identified U3CR, U7CR, U1RT, U2CR, U4CR, U14CR, U7RT, and U17RT isolates (GenBank Accession Nos. JX191921, 22, 27, 29, 31, and 33 to 35, respectively) as G. ultimum based on 100% similarity with corresponding sequence of the reference isolate no. UZ056 MAFF240024 (AB468781) (3). Phytopathogenicity testing was conducted in a petri dish and pot experiment. In the petri dish experiment, a 3 mm diameter plug was transferred from a 7-day-old CMA colony to the center of a CMA petri dish, with three replicates per isolate, and three control plates were inoculated with sterile agar plugs. After 72 h, 10 Aleppo pine seeds were placed equally spaced to 1 cm from the edge of each plug. After 7 days at 22∞C in the dark, germination inhibition (46.1 to 87.6%) and root growth inhibition (62.3 to 92.2%) were calculated. In the control plates, germination failure (13.4%) and root length (27.7 cm) were observed. For the pot experiment, inocula were produced by adding a 5 mm diameter plug from a 7-day-old CMA culture to a previously sterilized 500 ml flask containing 237.5 g sand, 12.5 g cornmeal, and 80 ml SDW. Nine-day-old inoculum was mixed with sterile soil at a rate of 1:3 (v:v). Inoculum was transferred to 500 ml pot, and 10 Aleppo pine seeds were planted, with three replicates per isolate, and three control pots were used. After 2 weeks, all of the isolates tested caused typical symptoms of Aleppo pine Pythium damping-off, the percentage of inoculated plants that became infected was 36.6 to 83.3%. In the control pots, no infected plants were observed. To our knowledge, this is the first report of G. ultimum causing damping-off on Aleppo pine in Algeria, Africa, and the Mediterranean Region. Before, Aleppo pine damping-off caused by G. ultimum was reported in Australia (1). References: (1) R. P. Cook and A. J. DubÈ. Host-pathogen index of plant diseases in South Australia.

25119676,Improvements to pairwise sequence comparison (PASC): a genome-based web tool for virus classification.,"The number of viral genome sequences in the public databases is increasing dramatically, and these sequences are playing an important role in virus classification. Pairwise sequence comparison is a sequence-based virus classification method. A program using this method calculates the pairwise identities of virus sequences within a virus family and displays their distribution, and visual analysis helps to determine demarcations at different taxonomic levels such as strain, species, genus and subfamily. Subsequent comparison of new sequences against existing ones allows viruses from which the new sequences were derived to be classified. Although this method cannot be used as the only criterion for virus classification in some cases, it is a quantitative method and has many advantages over conventional virus classification methods. It has been applied to several virus families, and there is an increasing interest in using this method for other virus families/groups. The Pairwise Sequence Comparison (PASC) classification tool was created at the National Center for Biotechnology Information. The tool's database stores pairwise identities for complete genomes/segments of 56 virus families/groups. Data in the system are updated every day to reflect changes in virus taxonomy and additions of new virus sequences to the public database. The web interface of the tool ( http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/sutils/pasc/ ) makes it easy to navigate and perform analyses. Multiple new viral genome sequences can be tested simultaneously with this system to suggest the taxonomic position of virus isolates in a specific family. PASC eliminates potential discrepancies in the results caused by different algorithms and/or different data used by researchers.",1,
22998891,Patterns of medication initiation in newly diagnosed diabetes mellitus: quality and cost implications.,"Currently, 25 million Americans are known to have diabetes, with an additional 7 million cases believed to be undiagnosed. It is estimated that direct and indirect costs of diabetes top $200 billion. Due to the significant health and financial burdens associated with diabetes, it is imperative that this disease be treated quickly and aggressively. In 2009, the American Diabetes Association and the European Association for the Study of Diabetes developed a consensus statement regarding the treatment of type 2 diabetes, citing lifestyle modification and metformin as the preferred first line therapies. In this study, the authors looked at prescription claims data for adults who were newly initiated on oral hypoglycemic monotherapy between January 1, 2006, and December 31, 2008, to determine if initiation patterns changed over time, to evaluate how well the treatment guidelines were being followed, and to assess the economic consequences of prescribing patterns by drug class for both patients and insurers. The results showed that over the course of the study period the proportion of patients initially treated with metformin increased, whereas those receiving sulfonylureas as first-line therapy decreased. Thiazolidinediones experienced the greatest decrease, falling from 20% to 8%, while prescriptions for dipeptidyl peptidase-4 inhibitors increase from 0-7%. Over a 6-month period, patients taking metformin or sulfonylureas paid approximately $38 to $40 in co-pays while insurance paid about $77. Patients taking other agents paid approximately $130 in co-pays and insurance paid over $500. The authors concluded that based its cost and safety profile, metformin should be the first line drug therapy for patients with newly diagnosed type 2 diabetes.

25687422,Mega2: validated data-reformatting for linkage and association analyses.,"BACKGROUND:In a typical study of the genetics of a complex human disease, many different analysis programs are used, to test for linkage and association. This requires extensive and careful data reformatting, as many of these analysis programs use differing input formats. Writing scripts to facilitate this can be tedious, time-consuming, and error-prone. To address these issues, the open source Mega2 data reformatting program provides validated and tested data conversions from several commonly-used input formats to many output formats. RESULTS:Mega2, the Manipulation Environment for Genetic Analysis, facilitates the creation of analysis-ready datasets from data gathered as part of a genetic study. It transparently allows users to process genetic data for family-based or case/control studies accurately and efficiently. In addition to data validation checks, Mega2 provides analysis setup capabilities for a broad choice of commonly-used genetic analysis programs. First released in 2000, Mega2 has recently been significantly improved in a number of ways. We have rewritten it in C++ and have reduced its memory requirements. Mega2 now can read input files in LINKAGE, PLINK, and VCF/BCF formats, as well as its own specialized annotated format. It supports conversion to many commonly-used formats including SOLAR, PLINK, Merlin, Mendel, SimWalk2, Cranefoot, IQLS, FBAT, MORGAN, BEAGLE, Eigenstrat, Structure, and PLINK/SEQ. When controlled by a batch file, Mega2 can be used non-interactively in data reformatting pipelines. Support for genetic data from several other species besides humans has been added. CONCLUSIONS:By providing tested and validated data reformatting, Mega2 facilitates more accurate and extensive analyses of genetic data, avoiding the need to write, debug, and maintain one's own custom data reformatting scripts.

33355345,Congress of Neurological Surgeons Systematic Review and Evidence-Based Guideline on Neuroablative Procedures for Patients With Cancer Pain.,"<h4>Background</h4>Managing cancer pain once it is refractory to conventional treatment continues to challenge caregivers committed to serving those who are suffering from a malignancy. Although neuromodulation has a role in the treatment of cancer pain for some patients, these therapies may not be suitable for all patients. Therefore, neuroablative procedures, which were once a mainstay in treating intractable cancer pain, are again on the rise. This guideline serves as a systematic review of the literature of the outcomes following neuroablative procedures.<h4>Objective</h4>To establish clinical practice guidelines for the use of neuroablative procedures to treat patients with cancer pain.<h4>Methods</h4>A systematic review of neuroablative procedures used to treat patients with cancer pain from 1980 to April 2019 was performed using the United States National Library of Medicine PubMed database, EMBASE, and Cochrane CENTRAL. After inclusion criteria were established, full text articles that met the inclusion criteria were reviewed by 2 members of the task force and the quality of the evidence was graded.<h4>Results</h4>In total, 14 646 relevant abstracts were identified by the literature search, from which 189 met initial screening criteria. After full text review, 58 of the 189 articles were included and subdivided into 4 different clinical scenarios. These include unilateral somatic nociceptive/neuropathic body cancer pain, craniofacial cancer pain, midline subdiaphragmatic visceral cancer pain, and disseminated cancer pain. Class II and III evidence was available for these 4 clinical scenarios. Level III recommendations were developed for the use of neuroablative procedures to treat patients with cancer pain.<h4>Conclusion</h4>Neuroablative procedures may be an option for treating patients with refractory cancer pain. Serious adverse events were reported in some studies, but were relatively uncommon. Improved imaging, refinements in technique and the availability of new lesioning modalities may minimize the risks of neuroablation even further.The full guidelines can be accessed at https://www.cns.org/guidelines/browse-guidelines-detail/guidelines-on-neuroablative-procedures-patients-wi.",0,
27752427,Possibilities of using the German Federal States' permanent soil monitoring program for the monitoring of potential effects of genetically modified organisms (GMO).,"<h4>Background</h4>In the Directive 2001/18/EC on the deliberate release of genetically modified organisms (GMO) into the environment, a monitoring of potential risks is prescribed after their deliberate release or placing on the market. Experience and data of already existing monitoring networks should be included. The present paper summarizes the major findings of a project funded by the Federal Agency for Nature Conservation (Nutzungsmˆglichkeiten der Boden-Dauerbeobachtung der L‰nder f¸r das Monitoring der Umweltwirkungen gentechnisch ver‰nderter Pflanzen. BfN Skripten, Bonn-Bad Godesberg 369, 2014). The full report in german language can be accessed on http://www.bfn.de†and is available as Additional file 1. The aim of the project was to check if it is possible to use the German permanent soil monitoring program (PSM) for the monitoring of GMO. Soil organism communities are highly diverse and relevant with respect to the sustainability of soil functions. They are exposed to GMO material directly by feeding or indirectly through food chain interactions. Other impacts are possible due to their close association to soil particles.<h4>Results</h4>The PSM program can be considered as representative with regard to different soil types and ecoregions in Germany, but not for all habitat types relevant for soil organisms. Nevertheless, it is suitable as a basic grid for monitoring the potential effects of GMO on soil invertebrates.<h4>Conclusions</h4>PSM sites should be used to derive reference values, i.e. range of abundance and presence of different relevant species of soil organisms. Based on these references, it is possible to derive threshold values to define the limit of acceptable change or impact. Therefore, a minimum set of sites and minimum set of standardized methods are needed, i.e. characterization of each site, sampling of selected soil organism groups, adequate adaptation of methods for the purpose of monitoring of potential effects of GMO. Finally, and probably most demanding, it is needed to develop a harmonized evaluation concept.",0,
23828786,Towards building a disease-phenotype knowledge base: extracting disease-manifestation relationship from literature.,"<h4>Motivation</h4>Systems approaches to studying phenotypic relationships among diseases are emerging as an active area of research for both novel disease gene discovery and drug repurposing. Currently, systematic study of disease phenotypic relationships on a phenome-wide scale is limited because large-scale machine-understandable disease-phenotype relationship knowledge bases are often unavailable. Here, we present an automatic approach to extract disease-manifestation (D-M) pairs (one specific type of disease-phenotype relationship) from the wide body of published biomedical literature.<h4>Data and methods</h4>Our method leverages external knowledge and limits the amount of human effort required. For the text corpus, we used 119 085 682 MEDLINE sentences (21 354 075 citations). First, we used D-M pairs from existing biomedical ontologies as prior knowledge to automatically discover D-M-specific syntactic patterns. We then extracted additional pairs from MEDLINE using the learned patterns. Finally, we analysed correlations between disease manifestations and disease-associated genes and drugs to demonstrate the potential of this newly created knowledge base in disease gene discovery and drug repurposing.<h4>Results</h4>In total, we extracted 121 359 unique D-M pairs with a high precision of 0.924. Among the extracted pairs, 120 419 (99.2%) have not been captured in existing structured knowledge sources. We have shown that disease manifestations correlate positively with both disease-associated genes and drug treatments.<h4>Conclusions</h4>The main contribution of our study is the creation of a large-scale and accurate D-M phenotype relationship knowledge base. This unique knowledge base, when combined with existing phenotypic, genetic and proteomic datasets, can have profound implications in our deeper understanding of disease etiology and in rapid drug repurposing.<h4>Availability</h4>http://nlp.case.edu/public/data/DMPatternUMLS/",1,
26553798,InterRNA: a database of base interactions in RNA structures.,"A major component of RNA structure stabilization are the hydrogen bonded interactions between the base residues. The importance and biological relevance for large clusters of base interactions can be much more easily investigated when their occurrences have been systematically detected, catalogued and compared. In this paper, we describe the database InterRNA (INTERactions in RNA structures database-http://mfrlab.org/interrna/) that contains records of known RNA 3D motifs as well as records for clusters of bases that are interconnected by hydrogen bonds. The contents of the database were compiled from RNA structural annotations carried out by the NASSAM (http://mfrlab.org/grafss/nassam) and COGNAC (http://mfrlab.org/grafss/cognac) computer programs. An analysis of the database content and comparisons with the existing corpus of knowledge regarding RNA 3D motifs clearly show that InterRNA is able to provide an extension of the annotations for known motifs as well as able to provide novel interactions for further investigations.",1,
22253280,BamView: visualizing and interpretation of next-generation sequencing read alignments.,"<h4>Unlabelled</h4>So-called next-generation sequencing (NGS) has provided the ability to sequence on a massive scale at low cost, enabling biologists to perform powerful experiments and gain insight into biological processes. BamView has been developed to visualize and analyse sequence reads from NGS platforms, which have been aligned to a reference sequence. It is a desktop application for browsing the aligned or mapped reads [Ruffalo, M, LaFramboise, T, Koyut¸rk, M. Comparative analysis of algorithms for next-generation sequencing read alignment. Bioinformatics 2011;27:2790-6] at different levels of magnification, from nucleotide level, where the base qualities can be seen, to genome or chromosome level where overall coverage is shown. To enable in-depth investigation of NGS data, various views are provided that can be configured to highlight interesting aspects of the data. Multiple read alignment files can be overlaid to compare results from different experiments, and filters can be applied to facilitate the interpretation of the aligned reads. As well as being a standalone application it can be used as an integrated part of the Artemis genome browser, BamView allows the user to study NGS data in the context of the sequence and annotation of the reference genome. Single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) density and candidate SNP sites can be highlighted and investigated, and read-pair information can be used to discover large structural insertions and deletions. The application will also calculate simple analyses of the read mapping, including reporting the read counts and reads per kilobase per million mapped reads (RPKM) for genes selected by the user.<h4>Availability</h4>BamView and Artemis are freely available software.

Reactome functions both as an archive of biological processes and as a tool for discovering unexpected functional relationships in data such as gene expression profiles or somatic mutation catalogues from tumor cells. To support the continued brisk growth in the size and complexity of Reactome, we have implemented a graph database, improved performance of data analysis tools, and designed new data structures and strategies to boost diagram viewer performance. To make our website more accessible to human users, we have improved pathway display and navigation by implementing interactive Enhanced High Level Diagrams (EHLDs) with an associated icon library, and subpathway highlighting and zooming, in a simplified and reorganized web site with adaptive design. To encourage re-use of our content, we have enabled export of pathway diagrams as 'PowerPoint' files.",1,
21756356,Statistical mutation calling from sequenced overlapping DNA pools in TILLING experiments.,"<h4>Background</h4>TILLING (Targeting induced local lesions IN genomes) is an efficient reverse genetics approach for detecting induced mutations in pools of individuals. Combined with the high-throughput of next-generation sequencing technologies, and the resolving power of overlapping pool design, TILLING provides an efficient and economical platform for functional genomics across thousands of organisms.<h4>Results</h4>We propose a probabilistic method for calling TILLING-induced mutations, and their carriers, from high throughput sequencing data of overlapping population pools, where each individual occurs in two pools. We assign a probability score to each sequence position by applying Bayes' Theorem to a simplified binomial model of sequencing error and expected mutations, taking into account the coverage level. We test the performance of our method on variable quality, high-throughput sequences from wheat and rice mutagenized populations.<h4>Conclusions</h4>We show that our method effectively discovers mutations in large populations with sensitivity of 92.5% and specificity of 99.8%. It also outperforms existing SNP detection methods in detecting real mutations, especially at higher levels of coverage variability across sequenced pools, and in lower quality short reads sequence data.

32022843,FTIP: an accurate and efficient method for global protein surface comparison.,"<h4>Motivation</h4>Global protein surface comparison (GPSC) studies have been limited compared to other research works on protein structure alignment/comparison due to lack of real applications associated with GPSC. However, the technology advances in cryo-electron tomography (CET) have made methods to identify proteins from their surface shapes extremely useful.<h4>Results</h4>In this study, we developed a new method called Farthest point sampling (FPS)-enhanced Triangulation-based Iterative-closest-Point (ICP) (FTIP) for GPSC. We applied it to protein classification using only surface shape information. Our method first extracts a set of feature points from protein surfaces using FPS and then uses a triangulation-based efficient ICP algorithm to align the feature points of the two proteins to be compared. Tested on a benchmark dataset with 2329 proteins using nearest-neighbor classification, FTIP outperformed the state-of-the-art method for GPSC based on 3D Zernike descriptors. Using real and simulated cryo-EM data, we show that FTIP could be applied in the future to address problems in protein identification in CET experiments.<h4>Availability and implementation</h4>Programs/scripts we developed/used in the study are available at http://ani.stat.fsu.edu/~yuan/index.fld/FTIP.tar.bz2.<h4>Supplementary information</h4>Supplementary data are available at Bioinformatics online.",0,

A wealth of information about drug and small molecule structure, targets, indications and side effects; induced gene expression signatures; and other attributes are publicly available through web-based tools, databases and repositories. By processing, abstracting and aggregating information from these resources into drug set libraries, knowledge about novel properties of drugs and small molecules can be systematically imputed with machine learning. In addition, drug set libraries can be used as the underlying database for drug set enrichment analysis. Here, we present Drugmonizome, a database with a search engine for querying annotated sets of drugs and small molecules for performing drug set enrichment analysis. Utilizing the data within Drugmonizome, we also developed Drugmonizome-ML. Drugmonizome-ML enables users to construct customized machine learning pipelines using the drug set libraries from Drugmonizome. To demonstrate the utility of Drugmonizome, drug sets from 12 independent SARS-CoV-2 in vitro screens were subjected to consensus enrichment analysis. Despite the low overlap among these 12 independent in vitro screens, we identified common biological processes critical for blocking viral replication. To demonstrate Drugmonizome-ML, we constructed a machine learning pipeline to predict whether approved and preclinical drugs may induce peripheral neuropathy as a potential side effect. Overall, the Drugmonizome and Drugmonizome-ML resources provide rich and diverse knowledge about drugs and small molecules for direct systems pharmacology applications.

22067445,"SCRIPDB: a portal for easy access to syntheses, chemicals and reactions in patents.","The patent literature is a rich catalog of biologically relevant chemicals; many public and commercial molecular databases contain the structures disclosed in patent claims. However, patents are an equally rich source of metadata about bioactive molecules, including mechanism of action, disease class, homologous experimental series, structural alternatives, or the synthetic pathways used to produce molecules of interest. Unfortunately, this metadata is discarded when chemical structures are deposited separately in databases. SCRIPDB is a chemical structure database designed to make this metadata accessible. SCRIPDB provides the full original patent text, reactions and relationships described within any individual patent, in addition to the molecular files common to structural databases.

28053162,POSTAR: a platform for exploring post-transcriptional regulation coordinated by RNA-binding proteins.,"We present POSTAR (http://POSTAR.ncrnalab.org), a resource of POST-trAnscriptional Regulation coordinated by RNA-binding proteins (RBPs). Precise characterization of post-transcriptional regulatory maps has accelerated dramatically in the past few years. Based on new studies and resources, POSTAR supplies the largest collection of experimentally probed (~23 million) and computationally predicted (approximately 117 million) RBP binding sites in the human and mouse transcriptomes. POSTAR annotates every transcript and its RBP binding sites using extensive information regarding various molecular regulatory events (e.g., splicing, editing, and modification), RNA secondary structures, disease-associated variants, and gene expression and function. Moreover, POSTAR provides a friendly, multi-mode, integrated search interface, which helps users to connect multiple RBP binding sites with post-transcriptional regulatory events, phenotypes, and diseases. Based on our platform, we were able to obtain novel insights into post-transcriptional regulation, such as the putative association between CPSF6 binding, RNA structural domains, and Li-Fraumeni syndrome SNPs. In summary, POSTAR represents an early effort to systematically annotate post-transcriptional regulatory maps and explore the putative roles of RBPs in human diseases.",1,

21523935,ncRNA consensus secondary structure derivation using grammar strings.,"Many noncoding RNAs (ncRNAs) function through both their sequences and secondary structures. Thus, secondary structure derivation is an important issue in today's RNA research. The state-of-the-art structure annotation tools are based on comparative analysis, which derives consensus structure of homologous ncRNAs. Despite promising results from existing ncRNA aligning and consensus structure derivation tools, there is a need for more efficient and accurate ncRNA secondary structure modeling and alignment methods. In this work, we introduce a consensus structure derivation approach based on grammar string, a novel ncRNA secondary structure representation that encodes an ncRNA's sequence and secondary structure in the parameter space of a context-free grammar (CFG) and a full RNA grammar including pseudoknots. Being a string defined on a special alphabet constructed from a grammar, grammar string converts ncRNA alignment into sequence alignment. We derive consensus secondary structures from hundreds of ncRNA families from BraliBase 2.1 and 25 families containing pseudoknots using grammar string alignment. Our experiments have shown that grammar string-based structure derivation competes favorably in consensus structure quality with Murlet and RNASampler. Source code and experimental data are available at http://www.cse.msu.edu/~yannisun/grammar-string.",1,
33295914,iDHS-DASTS: identifying DNase I hypersensitive sites based on LASSO and stacking learning.,"The DNase I hypersensitivity site is an important marker of the DNA regulatory region, and its identification in the DNA sequence is of great significance for biomedical research. However, traditional identification methods are extremely time-consuming and can not obtain an accurate result. In this paper, we proposed a predictor called iDHS-DASTS to identify the DHS based on benchmark datasets. First, we adopt a feature extraction method called PseDNC which can incorporate the original DNA properties and spatial information of the DNA sequence. Then we use a method called LASSO to reduce the dimensions of the original data. Finally, we utilize stacking learning as a classifier, which includes Adaboost, random forest, gradient boosting, extra trees and SVM. Before we train the classifier, we use SMOTE-Tomek to overcome the imbalance of the datasets. In the experiment, our iDHS-DASTS achieves remarkable performance on three benchmark datasets. We achieve state-of-the-art results with over 92.06%, 91.06% and 90.72% accuracy for datasets [Doublestruck S]1, [Doublestruck S]2 and [Doublestruck S]3, respectively. To verify the validation and transferability of our model, we establish another independent dataset [Doublestruck S]4, for which the accuracy can reach 90.31%. Furthermore, we used the proposed model to construct a user friendly web server called iDHS-DASTS, which is available at http://www.xdu-duan.cn/.",0,
29059366,SBCDDB: Sleeping Beauty Cancer Driver Database for gene discovery in mouse models of human cancers.,"Large-scale oncogenomic studies have identified few frequently mutated cancer drivers and hundreds of infrequently mutated drivers. Defining the biological context for rare driving events is fundamentally important to increasing our understanding of the druggable pathways in cancer. Sleeping Beauty (SB) insertional mutagenesis is a powerful gene discovery tool used to model human cancers in mice. Our lab and others have published a number of studies that identify cancer drivers from these models using various statistical and computational approaches. Here, we have integrated SB data from primary tumor models into an analysis and reporting framework, the Sleeping Beauty Cancer Driver DataBase (SBCDDB, http://sbcddb.moffitt.org), which identifies drivers in individual tumors or tumor populations. Unique to this effort, the SBCDDB utilizes a single, scalable, statistical analysis method that enables data to be grouped by different biological properties. This allows for SB drivers to be evaluated (and re-evaluated) under different contexts. The SBCDDB provides visual representations highlighting the spatial attributes of transposon mutagenesis and couples this functionality with analysis of gene sets, enabling users to interrogate relationships between drivers. The SBCDDB is a powerful resource for comparative oncogenomic analyses with human cancer genomics datasets for driver prioritization.",1,
31142855,Multi-omics of the gut microbial ecosystem in inflammatory bowel diseases.,"Inflammatory bowel diseases, which include Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis, affect several million individuals worldwide. Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis are complex diseases that are heterogeneous at the clinical, immunological, molecular, genetic, and microbial levels. Individual contributing factors have been the focus of extensive research. As part of the Integrative Human Microbiome Project (HMP2 or iHMP), we followed 132 subjects for one year each to generate integrated longitudinal molecular profiles of host and microbial activity during disease (up to 24 time points each; in total 2,965 stool, biopsy, and blood specimens). Here we present the results, which provide a comprehensive view of functional dysbiosis in the gut microbiome during inflammatory bowel disease activity. We demonstrate a characteristic increase in facultative anaerobes at the expense of obligate anaerobes, as well as molecular disruptions in microbial transcription (for example, among clostridia), metabolite pools (acylcarnitines, bile acids, and short-chain fatty acids), and levels of antibodies in host serum. Periods of disease activity were also marked by increases in temporal variability, with characteristic taxonomic, functional, and biochemical shifts. Finally, integrative analysis identified microbial, biochemical, and host factors central to this dysregulation. The study's infrastructure resources, results, and data, which are available through the Inflammatory Bowel Disease Multi'omics Database ( http://ibdmdb.org ), provide the most comprehensive description to date of host and microbial activities in inflammatory bowel diseases.",1,
22440904,Quantitative proteomics identifies vasopressin-responsive nuclear proteins in collecting duct cells.,"Vasopressin controls transport in the renal collecting duct, in part, by regulating transcription. This complex process, which can involve translocation and/or modification of transcriptional regulators, is not completely understood. Here, we applied a method for large-scale profiling of nuclear proteins to quantify vasopressin-induced changes in the nuclear proteome of cortical collecting duct (mpkCCD) cells. Using stable isotope labeling and tandem mass spectrometry, we quantified 3987 nuclear proteins and identified significant changes in the abundance of 65, including previously established targets of vasopressin signaling in the collecting duct. Vasopressin-induced changes in the abundance of the transcription factors JunB, Elf3, Gatad2b, and Hmbox1; transcriptional co-regulators Ctnnb1 (ﬂ-catenin) and Crebbp; subunits of the Mediator complex; E3 ubiquitin ligase Nedd4; nuclear transport regulator RanGap1; and several proteins associated with tight junctions and adherens junctions. Bioinformatic analysis showed that many of the quantified transcription factors have putative binding sites in the 5'-flanking regions of genes coding for the channel proteins Aqp2, Aqp3, Scnn1b (ENaCﬂ), and Scnn1g (ENaC<U+03B3>), which are known targets of vasopressin. Immunoblotting demonstrated that the increase in ﬂ-catenin in nuclear fractions was accompanied by an even larger increase in its phosphorylated form (pSer552). The findings provide a new online database resource for nuclear proteomics (http://helixweb.nih.gov/ESBL/Database/mNPD/) and generate new hypotheses regarding vasopressin-mediated transcriptional regulation in the collecting duct.",1,
33008298,Database: web application for visualization of the cumulated RNAseq data against the salicylic acid (SA) and methyl jasmonate (MeJA) treatment of Arabidopsis thaliana.,"<h4>Background</h4>Plants have adapted to survive under adverse conditions or exploit favorable conditions in response to their environment as sessile creatures. In a way of plant adaptation, plant hormones have been evolved to efficiently use limited resources. Plant hormones including auxin, jasmonic acid, salicylic acid, and ethylene have been studied to reveal their role in plant adaptation against their environment by phenotypic observation with experimental design such as mutation on hormone receptors and treatment / non-treatment of plant hormones along with other environmental conditions. With the development of Next Generation Sequencing (NGS) technology, it became possible to score the total gene expression of the sampled plants and estimate the degree of effect of plant hormones in gene expression. This allowed us to infer the signaling pathway through plant hormones, which greatly stimulated the study of functional genomics using mutants. Due to the continued development of NGS technology and analytical techniques, many plant hormone-related studies have produced and accumulated NGS-based data, especially RNAseq data have been stored in the sequence read archive represented by NCBI, EBI, and DDBJ.<h4>Description</h4>Here, hormone treatment RNAseq data of Arabidopsis (Col0), wild-type genotype, were collected with mock, SA, and MeJA treatments. The genes affected by hormones were identified through a machine learning approach. The degree of expression of the affected gene was quantified, visualized in boxplot using d3 (data-driven-document), and the database was built by Django.<h4>Conclusion</h4>Using this database, we created a web application ( http://pgl.gnu.ac.kr/hormoneDB/ ) that lists hormone-related or hormone-affected genes and visualizes the boxplot of the gene expression of selected genes. This web application eventually aids the functional genomics researchers who want to gather the cases of the gene responses by the hormones.",1,

To support handling of the broad spectra obtained from solid-state NMR or low-field benchtop NMR, we have developed and evaluated two preprocessing tools: sensitivity improvement with spectral integration, which enhances the signal-to-noise ratio by spectral integration, and peaks separation, which separates overlapping peaks by several algorithms, such as non-negative sparse coding. In addition, the InterSpin Laboratory Information Management System (SpinLIMS) database stores numerous standard spectra ranging from small molecules to macromolecules in solid and solution states (dissolved in polar/nonpolar solvents), and can be searched under various conditions using the following molecular assignment tools. SpinMacro supports easy assignment of macromolecules in natural mixtures via solid-state <sup>13</sup>C peaks and dimethyl sulfoxide-dissolved <sup>1</sup>H-<sup>13</sup>C correlation peaks. InterAnalysis improves the accuracy of molecular assignment by integrated analysis of <sup>1</sup>H-<sup>13</sup>C correlation peaks and <sup>1</sup>H-<i>J</i> correlation peaks of small molecules dissolved in D<sub>2</sub>O or deuterated methanol, which supports easy narrowing down of metabolite candidates. Finally, by enabling database interoperability, SpinLIMS's client software will ultimately support scientific discovery by facilitating sharing and reusing of NMR data.",1,
23587428,The Th17/Treg balance and the expression of related cytokines in Uygur cervical cancer patients.,"<h4>Background</h4>The fine balance of Th17/Treg is crucial for maintenance of immune homeostasis. The objective of this study was to investigate the balance of Th17/Treg and the expression of related cytokines in Uighur cervical cancer patients.<h4>Methods</h4>Peripheral blood was collected from 65 cases of cervical cancer patients, 42 cases of cervical CIN patients and 40 healthy people. Flow cytometry was used to detect the percentages of T cell subsets, including CD3+ T cells, CD4+ T cells, CD8+ T cells, Treg cells and Th17 cells. ELISA assay was conducted to detect expression levels of TGF-ﬂ, IL-6, IL-10, IL-17, IL-23 and IFN-<U+03B3>.<h4>Results</h4>There were no significant difference in the levels of CD3+ T cells, CD4+ T cells, CD8+ T cells, and the ratio of CD4+/CD8+ among the cervical cancer group, the CIN group and the healthy control group. However, compared with the healthy control group, the percentages of CD4+ CD25+ Treg, CD4+CD25+CD127- Treg, CD4+IL17+ Th17, CD4+CD25+Foxp3+, CD4+CD25- Foxp3+, CD8+CD25+CD127-Treg and CD8+CD25+Foxp3 were significantly higher in the cervical cancer group and the CIN group. Similar results were also found in the Th17/Treg ratio and the related cytokines. There was no significant difference between the cervical cancer group and the CIN group. Additionally, Th17 cell levels were positively correlated with IL-6, IL-23 and IL-17. Also, Treg cell levels were positively correlated with TGF-ﬂ, IL-10 and IL-6. Contrarily, Treg cell levels and IFN-<U+03B3> were negatively correlated.<h4>Conclusions</h4>Our data indicated that the Th17/Treg balance was broken in peripheral blood of cervical cancer patients. Analysis of Th17/Treg balance may have a significant implication in diagnosing cervical cancer.<h4>Virtual slides</h4>The virtual slide for this article can be found here: http://www.diagnosticpathology.diagnomx.eu/vs/1813823795931511.",0,
28149703,Expanding our understanding of the trade in marine aquarium animals.,"The trade of live marine animals for home and public aquaria has grown into a major global industry. Millions of marine fishes and invertebrates are removed from coral reefs and associated habitats each year. The majority are imported into the United States, with the remainder sent to Europe, Japan, and a handful of other countries. Despite the recent growth and diversification of the aquarium trade, to date, data collection is not mandatory, and hence comprehensive information on species volume and diversity is lacking. This lack of information makes it impossible to study trade pathways. Without species-specific volume and diversity data, it is unclear how importing and exporting governments can oversee this industry effectively or how sustainability should be encouraged. To expand our knowledge and understanding of the trade, and to effectively communicate this new understanding, we introduce the publically-available Marine Aquarium Biodiversity and Trade Flow online database (https://www.aquariumtradedata.org/). This tool was created to communicate the volume and diversity of marine fishes and/or invertebrates imported into the US over three complete years (2008, 2009, and 2011) and three partial years (2000, 2004, 2005). To create this tool, invoices pertaining to shipments of live marine fishes and invertebrates were scanned and analyzed for species name, species quantities, country of origin, port of entry, and city of import destination. Here we focus on the analysis of the later three years of data and also produce an estimate for the entirety of 2000, 2004, and 2005. The three-year aggregate totals (2008, 2009, 2011) indicate that just under 2,300 fish and 725 invertebrate species were imported into the US cumulatively, although just under 1,800 fish and 550 invertebrate species were traded annually. Overall, the total number of live marine animals decreased between 2008 and 2011. In 2008, 2009, and 2011, the total number of individual fish (8.2, 7.3, and 6.9 million individuals) and invertebrates (4.2, 3.7, and 3.6 million individuals) assessed by analyzing the invoice data are roughly 60% of the total volumes recorded through the Law Enforcement Management Information System (LEMIS) dataset. Using these complete years, we back-calculated the number of individuals of both fishes and invertebrates imported in 2000, 2004, and 2005. These estimates (9.3, 10.8, and 11.2 million individual fish per year) were consistent with the three years of complete data. We also use these data to understand the global trade in two species (Banggai cardinalfish, <i>Pterapogon kauderni</i>, and orange clownfish, <i>Amphiprion ocellaris</i> / <i>percula</i>) recently considered for Endangered Species Act listing. Aquariumtradedata.org can help create more effective management plans for the traded species, and ideally could be implemented at key trade ports to better assess the global trade of aquatic wildlife.",1,
23095498,"The human ""magnesome"": detecting magnesium binding sites on human proteins.","<h4>Background</h4>Magnesium research is increasing in molecular medicine due to the relevance of this ion in several important biological processes and associated molecular pathogeneses. It is still difficult to predict from the protein covalent structure whether a human chain is or not involved in magnesium binding. This is mainly due to little information on the structural characteristics of magnesium binding sites in proteins and protein complexes. Magnesium binding features, differently from those of other divalent cations such as calcium and zinc, are elusive. Here we address a question that is relevant in protein annotation: how many human proteins can bind Mg2+? Our analysis is performed taking advantage of the recently implemented Bologna Annotation Resource (BAR-PLUS), a non hierarchical clustering method that relies on the pair wise sequence comparison of about 14 millions proteins from over 300.000 species and their grouping into clusters where annotation can safely be inherited after statistical validation.<h4>Results</h4>After cluster assignment of the latest version of the human proteome, the total number of human proteins for which we can assign putative Mg binding sites is 3,751. Among these proteins, 2,688 inherit annotation directly from human templates and 1,063 inherit annotation from templates of other organisms. Protein structures are highly conserved inside a given cluster. Transfer of structural properties is possible after alignment of a given sequence with the protein structures that characterise a given cluster as obtained with a Hidden Markov Model (HMM) based procedure. Interestingly a set of 370 human sequences inherit Mg2+ binding sites from templates sharing less than 30% sequence identity with the template.<h4>Conclusion</h4>We describe and deliver the ""human magnesome"", a set of proteins of the human proteome that inherit putative binding of magnesium ions. With our BAR-hMG, 251 clusters including 1,341 magnesium binding protein structures corresponding to 387 sequences are sufficient to annotate some 13,689 residues in 3,751 human sequences as ""magnesium binding"". Protein structures act therefore as three dimensional seeds for structural and functional annotation of human sequences. The data base collects specifically all the human proteins that can be annotated according to our procedure as ""magnesium binding"", the corresponding structures and BAR+ clusters from where they derive the annotation (http://bar.biocomp.unibo.it/mg).",1,

IND606427025,First Report of Sugarcane Yellow Leaf Disease in Mexico and Detection of ‚ÄòCandidatus Phytoplasma asteris‚Äô-Related Strains in Affected Plants,"Sugarcane is a common name for any of several tall perennial grass species of the genus Saccharum. As a major source for sugar production and an efficient feedstock for biofuel generation, sugarcane is widely cultivated in tropical and subtropical regions. Mexico alone produces over six million metric tons of cane sugar annually valued at 1.3 billion U.S. dollars. Although economically important, sugarcane is susceptible to devastating diseases caused by phloem-colonizing, cell wall-less bacteria known as phytoplasmas. Different sugarcane phytoplasmal diseases around the world have been attributed to diverse phytoplasmas belonging to six mutually distinct ëCandidatus Phytoplasmaí species (Marcone 2002). During the 2015 to 2016 growing season, sugarcane plants exhibiting leaf discolorations (white and yellow streaks) indicative of sugarcane yellow leaf (ScYL) disease were observed in a sugarcane field in Cosamaloapan, Veracruz, Mexico, with less than 1% of the plants in the field being affected. Leaf samples were collected from three symptomatic and three asymptomatic plants in the same field. Total DNA was extracted from leaf midribs using a modified cetyltrimethylammonium bromide method (Pe¥rez-Lo¥pez et al. 2016). A preliminary diagnostic assay was carried out using direct polymerase chain reactions (PCRs) with phytoplasma-specific primer pair R16F2n/R16R2. All PCR assays with DNA templates from symptomatic plants produced a phytoplasma-characteristic amplicon of 1.25 kb. No amplicon was detected from samples of asymptomatic plants. The DNA samples from symptomatic plants were subjected to further PCR analysis with primer pair P1A/16S-SR as previously described (Wei et al. 2011). All three samples were PCR positive, and each yielded a 1,539-bp amplicon. The amplicons were cloned and sequenced with at least 6◊ coverage per base position. DNA sequence analysis confirmed that the amplicon represented a near-full-length 16S rRNA gene and a partial 16S-23S RNA gene intergenic spacer. The obtained DNA sequences were deposited into GenBank (accession nos. MH891144 through MH891146). Analysis of the sequences through the iPhyClassifier (Zhao et al. 2009, https://plantpathology.ba.ars.usda.gov/cgi-bin/resource/iphyclassifier.cgi) revealed that the phytoplasmas detected in the ScYL-diseased plants were closely related to the reference strain of ëCandidatus Phytoplasma asterisí (aster yellows phytoplasma, >99.4% sequence similarity). Although the three 16S rRNA gene sequences differed from each other by two to five bases, all possessed the entire set of signature sequences (G196GGAGGA202, C444TGACGGTACC454, and C976ACAGTGGA GGTTATCAGTTG996) of ëCa. P. asterisí (Lee et al. 2004), indicating the three ScYL phytoplasma strains are ìsequevarsî (Davis et al. 2015) affiliated with a single phytoplasma species. To our knowledge, this is the first report of phytoplasmal ScYL disease in Mexico. Associations of aster yellows phytoplasma with sugarcane diseases were previously reported in Cuba and Brazil (Arocha et al. 1999; Silva et al. 2009). Recently, infection of aster yellows phytoplasma in weedy grass growing near sugarcane fields in Mexico was noted (Pe¥rez-Lo¥pez and Dumonceaux 2017). Findings of aster yellows phytoplasma infecting sugarcane in the countries of Brazil, Cuba, and now Mexico (this report) underscore the need for disease surveillance of sugarcane in neighboring countries, because insect vectors capable of spreading aster yellows phytoplasma strains are known to be present over wide areas, including the Caribbean countries and the United States.",0,
33245691,NonClasGP-Pred: robust and efficient prediction of non-classically secreted proteins by integrating subset-specific optimal models of imbalanced data.,"Non-classically secreted proteins (NCSPs) are proteins that are located in the extracellular environment, although there is a lack of known signal peptides or secretion motifs. They usually perform different biological functions in intracellular and extracellular environments, and several of their biological functions are linked to bacterial virulence and cell defence. Accurate protein localization is essential for all living organisms, however, the performance of existing methods developed for NCSP identification has been unsatisfactory and in particular suffer from data deficiency and possible overfitting problems. Further improvement is desirable, especially to address the lack of informative features and mining subset-specific features in imbalanced datasets. In the present study, a new computational predictor was developed for NCSP prediction of gram-positive bacteria. First, to address the possible prediction bias caused by the data imbalance problem, ten balanced subdatasets were generated for ensemble model construction. Then, the F-score algorithm combined with sequential forward search was used to strengthen the feature representation ability for each of the training subdatasets. Third, the subset-specific optimal feature combination process was adopted to characterize the original data from different aspects, and all subdataset-based models were integrated into a unified model, NonClasGP-Pred, which achieved an excellent performance with an accuracy of 93.23 %, a sensitivity of 100 %, a specificity of 89.01 %, a Matthew's correlation coefficient of 87.68 % and an area under the curve value of 0.9975 for ten-fold cross-validation.

32293391,Evaluation of a computer-assisted multi-professional intervention to address lifestyle-related risk factors for overweight and obesity in expecting mothers and their infants: protocol for an effectiveness-implementation hybrid study.,"BACKGROUND:The first 1000 days after conception are a critical period to encourage lifestyle changes to reduce the risk of childhood obesity and early programming of chronic diseases. A healthy lifestyle during pregnancy is also crucial to avoid high post-partum weight retention. Currently, lifestyle changes are not consistently discussed during routine health services in Germany. The objective of this study is to evaluate a novel computer-assisted lifestyle intervention embedded in prenatal visits and infant check-ups. The intervention seeks to reduce lifestyle-related risk factors for overweight and obesity among expecting mothers and their infants. METHODS:The study is designed as a hybrid effectiveness-implementation trial to simultaneously collect data on the effectiveness and implementation of the lifestyle intervention. The trial will take place in eight regions of the German state Baden-Wuerttemberg. Region were matched using propensity score matching. Expecting mothers (n = 1860) will be recruited before 12 weeks of gestation through gynecological practices and followed for 18 months. During 11 routine prenatal visits and infant check-ups gynecologists, midwives and pediatricians provide lifestyle counseling using Motivational Interviewing techniques. The primary outcome measure is the proportion of expecting mothers with gestational weight gain within the recommended range. To understand the process of implementation (focus group) interviews will be conducted with providers and participants of the lifestyle intervention. Additionally, an analysis of administrative data and documents will be carried out. An economic analysis will provide insights into cost and consequences compared to routine health services. DISCUSSION:Findings of this study will add to the evidence on lifestyle interventions to reduce risk for overweight and obesity commenced during pregnancy. Insights gained will contribute to the prevention of early programming of chronic disease. Study results regarding implementation fidelity, adoption, reach and cost-effectiveness of the lifestyle intervention will inform decisions about scale up and public funding.

23061897,"Sifting through genomes with iterative-sequence clustering produces a large, phylogenetically diverse protein-family resource.","<h4>Background</h4>New computational resources are needed to manage the increasing volume of biological data from genome sequencing projects. One fundamental challenge is the ability to maintain a complete and current catalog of protein diversity. We developed a new approach for the identification of protein families that focuses on the rapid discovery of homologous protein sequences.<h4>Results</h4>We implemented fully automated and high-throughput procedures to de novo cluster proteins into families based upon global alignment similarity. Our approach employs an iterative clustering strategy in which homologs of known families are sifted out of the search for new families. The resulting reduction in computational complexity enables us to rapidly identify novel protein families found in new genomes and to perform efficient, automated updates that keep pace with genome sequencing. We refer to protein families identified through this approach as ""Sifting Families,"" or SFams. Our analysis of ~10.5 million protein sequences from 2,928 genomes identified 436,360 SFams, many of which are not represented in other protein family databases. We validated the quality of SFam clustering through statistical as well as network topology-based analyses.<h4>Conclusions</h4>We describe the rapid identification of SFams and demonstrate how they can be used to annotate genomes and metagenomes. The SFam database catalogs protein-family quality metrics, multiple sequence alignments, hidden Markov models, and phylogenetic trees. Our source code and database are publicly available and will be subject to frequent updates (http://edhar.genomecenter.ucdavis.edu/sifting_families/).",1,

The database now contains a number of mutations that are associated with prostate cancer (CaP) treatment regimens, while the number of AR mutations found in CaP tissues has more than doubled from 76 to 159. In addition, in a number of androgen insensitivity syndrome (AIS) and CaP cases, multiple mutations have been found within the same tissue samples. For the first time, we report on a disconnect within the AIS phenotype-genotype relationship among our own patient database, in that over 40% of our patients with a classic complete AIS or partial AIS phenotypes did not appear to have a mutation in their AR gene. The implications of this phenomenon on future locus-specific mutation database (LSDB) development are discussed, together with the concept that mutations can be associated with both loss- and gain-of-function, and the effect of multiple AR mutations within individuals. The database is available on the internet (http://androgendb.mcgill.ca), and a web-based LSDB with the variants using the Leiden Open Variation Database platform is available at http://www.lovd.nl/AR.",1,
24339543,Phenotypic spectrum in uniparental disomy: Low incidence or lack of study?,"<h4>Context</h4>Alterations in the human chromosomal complement are expressed phenotypically ranging from (i) normal, via (ii) frequent fetal loss in otherwise normal person, to (iii) sub-clinical to severe mental retardation and dysmorphism in live births. A subtle and microscopically undetectable chromosomal alteration is uniparental disomy (UPD), which is known to be associated with distinct birth defects as per the chromosome involved and parental origin. UPD can be evident due to imprinted genes and/or activation of recessive mutations.<h4>Aims</h4>The present study comprises of data mining of published UPD cases with a focus on associated phenotypes. The goal was to identify non-random and recurrent associations between UPD and various genetic conditions, which can possibly indicate the presence of new imprinted genes.<h4>Settings and design</h4>Data mining was carried out using the homepage ""http://www.fish.uniklinikum-jena.de/UPD.html."", an online catalog of published cases with UPD.<h4>Materials and methods</h4>The UPD cases having normal karyotype and with or without clinical findings were selected to analyze the associated phenotypes for each chromosome, maternal or paternal involved in UPD.<h4>Results</h4>Our results revealed many genetic conditions (other than the known UPD syndromes) to be associated with UPD. Even in cases of bad obstetric history as well as normal individuals chance detection of UPD has been reported.<h4>Conclusions</h4>The role of UPD in human genetic disorders needs to be studied by involving larger cohorts of individuals with birth defects as well as normal population. The genetic conditions were scrutinized in terms of inheritance patterns; majority of these were autosomal recessive indicating the role of UPD as an underlying mechanism.",0,
26072509,IgRepertoireConstructor: a novel algorithm for antibody repertoire construction and immunoproteogenomics analysis.,"<h4>Unlabelled</h4>The analysis of concentrations of circulating antibodies in serum (antibody repertoire) is a fundamental, yet poorly studied, problem in immunoinformatics. The two current approaches to the analysis of antibody repertoires [next generation sequencing (NGS) and mass spectrometry (MS)] present difficult computational challenges since antibodies are not directly encoded in the germline but are extensively diversified by somatic recombination and hypermutations. Therefore, the protein database required for the interpretation of spectra from circulating antibodies is custom for each individual. Although such a database can be constructed via NGS, the reads generated by NGS are error-prone and even a single nucleotide error precludes identification of a peptide by the standard proteomics tools. Here, we present the IgRepertoireConstructor algorithm that performs error-correction of immunosequencing reads and uses mass spectra to validate the constructed antibody repertoires.<h4>Availability and implementation</h4>IgRepertoireConstructor is open source and freely available as a C++ and Python program running on all Unix-compatible platforms. The source code is available from http://bioinf.spbau.ru/igtools.<h4>Contact</h4>ppevzner@ucsd.edu<h4>Supplementary information</h4>Supplementary data are available at Bioinformatics online.",0,
30387741,A Note on GRegNetSim: A Tool for the Discrete Simulation and Analysis of Genetic Regulatory Networks.,"Discrete simulations of genetic regulatory networks were used to study subsystems of yeast successfully. However, implementations of existing models underlying these simulations do not support a graphic interface, and require computations necessary to analyze their results to be done manually. Furthermore, differences between existing models suggest that an enriched model, encompassing both existing models, is needed. We developed a software tool, GRegNetSim, that allows the end-user to describe genetic regulatory networks graphically. The user can specify various transition functions at different nodes of the network, supporting, for example, threshold and gradient effects, and then apply the network to a variety of inputs. GRegNetSim displays the relationship between the inputs and the mode of behavior of the network in a graphic form that is easy to interpret. Furthermore, it can automatically extract statistical data necessary to analyze the simulations. The discrete simulations performed by GRegNetSim can be used to elucidate and predict the behavior, structure and properties of genetic regulatory networks in a unified manner. GRegNetSim is implemented as a Cytoscape App. Installation files, examples and source code, along with a detailed user guide, are freely available at https://sites.google.com/site/gregnetsim/.",0,
32912508,"Rationale and Design of a Randomized, Double-Blind Trial Evaluating the Efficacy of Tranexamic Acid on Hematoma Expansion and Peri-hematomal Edema in Patients with Spontaneous Intracerebral Hemorrhage within 4.5¬†h after Symptom Onset: The THE-ICH Trial Protocol.","<h4>Background</h4>Hematoma expansion (HE) and peri-hematomal edema (PHE) are associated with adverse outcomes of patients with acute spontaneous intracerebral hemorrhage (sICH). Due to a lack of proven treatments, it is critical to explore novel treatments for HE and PHE to improve functional recovery after sICH.<h4>Methods</h4>This is a prospective, multicenter, placebo-controlled, double-blind, and randomized clinical study of approximately 2400 patients with sICH. Patients within 4.5†h of sICH onset that fulfilling the clinical criteria for diagnosis (e.g. age more than 18 years old, the Glasgow Coma Scal>7, and no planned surgery) will randomly receive either intravenous tranexamic acid (TXA) 1 g 10-min bolus followed by 1†g eight-hour infusion or placebo (sodium chloride 0.9%). Clinical data including the ICH score and the Glasgow Coma Scale score will be collected on admission. After assessment of HE and PHE expansion, follow-up will be conducted with enrolled patients for 90 days.<h4>Results</h4>Primary outcome metrics are HE (defined as either >33% or >6†ml increase from baseline) and PHE expansion rate at 24 ± 3†h and 72 ± 3†h post-sICH. Secondary outcome metrics include mortality and the modified Rankin Scale on day 90 after sICH. Appropriate statistic methods will be used to evaluate the efficacy of TXA on patients with sICH within 4.5†h of symptom onset.<h4>Conclusions</h4>HE usually occurs within the first few hours after onset of symptoms. It is essential to evaluate the efficacy of TXA on HE within a narrow window of time. This will be the first trial to evaluate the efficacy of TXA on HE and PHE expansion in sICH patients within 4.5†h after symptom onset. This trial is registered as ChiCTR1900027065 at http://www.chictr.org.cn.",0,
32614398,Using AnABlast for intergenic sORF prediction in the Caenorhabditis elegans genome.,"<h4>Motivation</h4>Short bioactive peptides encoded by small open reading frames (sORFs) play important roles in eukaryotes. Bioinformatics prediction of ORFs is an early step in a genome sequence analysis, but sORFs encoding short peptides, often using non-AUG initiation codons, are not easily discriminated from false ORFs occurring by chance.<h4>Results</h4>AnABlast is a computational tool designed to highlight putative protein-coding regions in genomic DNA sequences. This protein-coding finder is independent of ORF length and reading frame shifts, thus making of AnABlast a potentially useful tool to predict sORFs. Using this algorithm, here, we report the identification of 82 putative new intergenic sORFs in the Caenorhabditis elegans genome. Sequence similarity, motif presence, expression data and RNA interference experiments support that the underlined sORFs likely encode functional peptides, encouraging the use of AnABlast as a new approach for the accurate prediction of intergenic sORFs in annotated eukaryotic genomes.<h4>Availability and implementation</h4>AnABlast is freely available at http://www.bioinfocabd.upo.es/ab/. The C.elegans genome browser with AnABlast results, annotated genes and all data used in this study is available at http://www.bioinfocabd.upo.es/celegans.<h4>Supplementary information</h4>Supplementary data are available at Bioinformatics online.",1,
31199465,Positive multistate protein design.,"<h4>Motivation</h4>Structure-based computational protein design (CPD) plays a critical role in advancing the field of protein engineering. Using an all-atom energy function, CPD tries to identify amino acid sequences that fold into a target structure and ultimately perform a desired function. The usual approach considers a single rigid backbone as a target, which ignores backbone flexibility. Multistate design (MSD) allows instead to consider several backbone states simultaneously, defining challenging computational problems.<h4>Results</h4>We introduce efficient reductions of positive MSD problems to Cost Function Networks with two different fitness definitions and implement them in the Pompd (Positive Multistate Protein design) software. Pompd is able to identify guaranteed optimal sequences of positive multistate full protein redesign problems and exhaustively enumerate suboptimal sequences close to the MSD optimum. Applied to nuclear magnetic resonance and back-rubbed X-ray structures, we observe that the average energy fitness provides the best sequence recovery. Our method outperforms state-of-the-art guaranteed computational design approaches by orders of magnitudes and can solve MSD problems with sizes previously unreachable with guaranteed algorithms.<h4>Availability and implementation</h4>https://forgemia.inra.fr/thomas.schiex/pompd as documented Open Source.<h4>Supplementary information</h4>Supplementary data are available at Bioinformatics online.",0,
24250114,SNPAAMapper: An efficient genome-wide SNP variant analysis pipeline for next-generation sequencing data.,"<h4>Unlabelled</h4>Many NGS analysis tools focusing on read alignment and variant calling functions for exome sequencing data have been developed in recent years. However, publicly available tools dealing with the downstream analysis of genome-wide variants are fewer and have limited functionality. We developed SNPAAMapper, a novel variant analysis pipeline that can effectively classify variants by region (e.g. CDS, UTRs, intron, upstream, downstream), predict amino acid change type (e.g. synonymous, non-synonymous mutation), and prioritize mutation effects (e.g. CDS versus UTRs). Additional functionality afforded by our pipeline includes: checking variants at exon/intron junctions, customized homozygosity and allele frequency cutoff parameters, and annotation of known variants with dbSNP information, listing original and mutated amino acid sequences containing variants. The final result is reported in a spreadsheet format table containing all variant associated information and prioritized amino acids effects for investigators to examine.<h4>Availability</h4>Perl scripts and required input files are available on the web at http://www.ccmb.med.umich.edu/ccdu /SNPAAMapper.",0,
27153703,Phasing for medical sequencing using rare variants and large haplotype reference panels.,"<h4>Motivation</h4>There is growing recognition that estimating haplotypes from high coverage sequencing of single samples in clinical settings is an important problem. At the same time very large datasets consisting of tens and hundreds of thousands of high-coverage sequenced samples will soon be available. We describe a method that takes advantage of these huge human genetic variation resources and rare variant sharing patterns to estimate haplotypes on single sequenced samples. Sharing rare variants between two individuals is more likely to arise from a recent common ancestor and, hence, also more likely to indicate similar shared haplotypes over a substantial flanking region of sequence.<h4>Results</h4>Our method exploits this idea to select a small set of highly informative copying states within a Hidden Markov Model (HMM) phasing algorithm. Using rare variants in this way allows us to avoid iterative MCMC methods to infer haplotypes. Compared to other approaches that do not explicitly use rare variants we obtain significant gains in phasing accuracy, less variation over phasing runs and improvements in speed. For example, using a reference panel of 7420 haplotypes from the UK10K project, we are able to reduce switch error rates by up to 50% when phasing samples sequenced at high-coverage. In addition, a single step rephasing of the UK10K panel, using rare variant information, has a downstream impact on phasing performance. These results represent a proof of concept that rare variant sharing patterns can be utilized to phase large high-coverage sequencing studies such as the 100 000 Genomes Project dataset.<h4>Availability and implementation</h4>A webserver that includes an implementation of this new method and allows phasing of high-coverage clinical samples is available at https://phasingserver.stats.ox.ac.uk/<h4>Contact</h4>marchini@stats.ox.ac.uk<h4>Supplementary information</h4>Supplementary data are available at Bioinformatics online.",0,
31950241,Evaluating genetic causes of azoospermia: What can we learn from a complex cellular structure and single-cell transcriptomics of the human testis?,"Azoospermia is a condition defined as the absence of spermatozoa in the ejaculate, but the testicular phenotype of men with azoospermia may be very variable, ranging from full spermatogenesis, through arrested maturation of germ cells at different stages, to completely degenerated tissue with ghost tubules. Hence, information regarding the cell-type-specific expression patterns is needed to prioritise potential pathogenic variants that contribute to the pathogenesis of azoospermia. Thanks to technological advances within next-generation sequencing, it is now possible to obtain detailed cell-type-specific expression patterns in the testis by single-cell RNA sequencing. However, to interpret single-cell RNA sequencing data properly, substantial knowledge of the highly sophisticated data processing and visualisation methods is needed. Here we review the complex cellular structure of the human testis in different types of azoospermia and outline how known genetic alterations affect the pathology of the testis. We combined the currently available single-cell RNA sequencing datasets originating from the human testis into one dataset covering 62,751 testicular cells, each with a median of 2637 transcripts quantified. We show what effects the most common data-processing steps have, and how different visualisation methods can be used. Furthermore, we calculated expression patterns in pseudotime, and show how splicing rates can be used to determine the velocity of differentiation during spermatogenesis. With the combined dataset we show expression patterns and network analysis of genes known to be involved in the pathogenesis of azoospermia. Finally, we provide the combined dataset as an interactive online resource where expression of genes and different visualisation methods can be explored ( https://testis.cells.ucsc.edu/ ).",1,
23153116,Unipept: tryptic peptide-based biodiversity analysis of metaproteome samples.,"The Unipept web application (http://unipept.ugent.be) supports biodiversity analysis of large and complex metaproteome samples using tryptic peptide information obtained from shotgun MS/MS experiments. Its underlying index structure is designed to quickly retrieve all occurrences of a tryptic peptide in UniProtKB records. Taxon-specificity of the tryptic peptide is successively derived from these occurrences using a novel lowest common ancestor approach that is robust against taxonomic misarrangements, misidentifications, and inaccuracies. Not taking into account this identification noise would otherwise result in drastic loss of information. Dynamic treemaps visualize the biodiversity of metaproteome samples, which eases the exploration of samples with highly complex compositions. The potential of Unipept to gain novel insights into the biodiversity of a sample is evaluated by reanalyzing publicly available metaproteome data sets taken from the bacterial phyllosphere and the human gut.",0,
32159215,TeaMiD: a comprehensive database of simple sequence repeat markers of tea.,"Tea is a highly cross-pollinated, woody, perennial tree. High heterozygosity combined with a long gestational period makes conventional breeding a cumbersome process. Therefore, marker-assisted breeding is a better alternative approach when compared with conventional breeding. Considering the large genome size of tea (~3†Gb), information about simple sequence repeat (SSR) is scanty. Thus, we have taken advantage of the recently published tea genomes to identify large numbers of SSR markers in the tea. Besides the genomic sequences, we identified SSRs from the other publicly available sequences such as RNA-seq, GSS, ESTs and organelle genomes (chloroplasts and mitochondrial) and also searched published literature to catalog validated set of tea SSR markers. The complete exercise yielded a total of 935 547 SSRs. Out of the total, 82 SSRs were selected for validation among a diverse set of tea genotypes. Six primers (each with four to six alleles, an average of five alleles per locus) out of the total 27 polymorphic primers were used for a diversity analysis in 36 tea genotypes with mean polymorphic information content of 0.61-0.76. Finally, using all the information generated in this study, we have developed a user-friendly database (TeaMiD; http://indianteagenome.in:8080/teamid/) that hosts SSR from all the six resources including three nuclear genomes of tea and transcriptome sequences of 17 Camellia wild species.

24700317,Fast alignment-free sequence comparison using spaced-word frequencies.,"<h4>Motivation</h4>Alignment-free methods for sequence comparison are increasingly used for genome analysis and phylogeny reconstruction; they circumvent various difficulties of traditional alignment-based approaches. In particular, alignment-free methods are much faster than pairwise or multiple alignments. They are, however, less accurate than methods based on sequence alignment. Most alignment-free approaches work by comparing the word composition of sequences. A well-known problem with these methods is that neighbouring word matches are far from independent.<h4>Results</h4>To reduce the statistical dependency between adjacent word matches, we propose to use 'spaced words', defined by patterns of 'match' and 'don't care' positions, for alignment-free sequence comparison. We describe a fast implementation of this approach using recursive hashing and bit operations, and we show that further improvements can be achieved by using multiple patterns instead of single patterns. To evaluate our approach, we use spaced-word frequencies as a basis for fast phylogeny reconstruction. Using real-world and simulated sequence data, we demonstrate that our multiple-pattern approach produces better phylogenies than approaches relying on contiguous words.<h4>Availability and implementation</h4>Our program is freely available at http://spaced.gobics.de/.",0,
24507755,Systematic characterization of small RNAome during zebrafish early developmental stages.,"<h4>Background</h4>During early vertebrate development, various small non-coding RNAs (sRNAs) such as MicroRNAs (miRNAs) and Piwi-interacting RNAs (piRNAs) are dynamically expressed for orchestrating the maternal-to-zygotic transition (MZT). Systematic analysis of expression profiles of zebrafish small RNAome will be greatly helpful for understanding the sRNA regulation during embryonic development.<h4>Results</h4>We first determined the expression profiles of sRNAs during eight distinct stages of early zebrafish development by sRNA-seq technology. Integrative analyses with a new computational platform of CSZ (characterization of small RNAome for zebrafish) demonstrated an sRNA class transition from piRNAs to miRNAs as development proceeds. We observed that both the abundance and diversity of miRNAs are gradually increased, while the abundance is enhanced more dramatically than the diversity during development. However, although both the abundance and diversity of piRNAs are gradually decreased, the diversity was firstly increased then rapidly decreased. To evaluate the computational accuracy, the expression levels of four known miRNAs were experimentally validated. We also predicted 25 potentially novel miRNAs, whereas two candidates were verified by Northern blots.<h4>Conclusions</h4>Taken together, our analyses revealed the piRNA to miRNA transition as a conserved mechanism in zebrafish, although two different types of sRNAs exhibit distinct expression dynamics in abundance and diversity, respectively. Our study not only generated a better understanding for sRNA regulations in early zebrafish development, but also provided a useful platform for analyzing sRNA-seq data. The CSZ was implemented in Perl and freely downloadable at: http://csz.biocuckoo.org.",0,
25495213,Genotype harmonizer: automatic strand alignment and format conversion for genotype data integration.,"<h4>Background</h4>To gain statistical power or to allow fine mapping, researchers typically want to pool data before meta-analyses or genotype imputation. However, the necessary harmonization of genetic datasets is currently error-prone because of many different file formats and lack of clarity about which genomic strand is used as reference.<h4>Findings</h4>Genotype Harmonizer (GH) is a command-line tool to harmonize genetic datasets by automatically solving issues concerning genomic strand and file format. GH solves the unknown strand issue by aligning ambiguous A/T and G/C SNPs to a specified reference, using linkage disequilibrium patterns without prior knowledge of the used strands. GH supports many common GWAS/NGS genotype formats including PLINK, binary PLINK, VCF, SHAPEIT2 & Oxford GEN. GH is implemented in Java and a large part of the functionality can also be used as Java 'Genotype-IO' API. All software is open source under license LGPLv3 and available from http://www.molgenis.org/systemsgenetics.<h4>Conclusions</h4>GH can be used to harmonize genetic datasets across different file formats and can be easily integrated as a step in routine meta-analysis and imputation pipelines.",0,
21643562,Toxicity tests aiming to protect Brazilian aquatic systems: current status and implications for management.,"The current status of toxicological tests performed with Brazilian native species was evaluated through a survey of the scientific data available in the literature. The information gathered was processed and an electronic toxicology database (http://www.inct-ta.furg.br/bd_toxicologico.php) was generated. This database provides valuable information for researchers to select sensitive and tolerant aquatic species to a large variety of aquatic pollutants. Furthermore, the toxicology database allows researchers to select species representative of an ecosystem of interest. Analysis of the toxicology database showed that ecotoxicological assays have significantly improved in Brazil over the last decade, in spite of the still relatively low number of tests performed and the restricted number of native species tested. This is because most of the research is developed in a few laboratories concentrated in certain regions of Brazil, especially in Southern and Southeast regions. Considering the extremely rich biodiversity and the large variety of aquatic ecosystems in Brazil, this finding points to the urgent need for the development of ecotoxicological studies with other groups of aquatic animals, such as insects, foraminifera, cnidarians, worms, amphibians, among others. This would help to derive more realistic water quality criteria (WQC) values, which would better protect the different aquatic ecosystems in Brazil. Finally, the toxicology database generated presents solid and science based information, which can encourage and drive the Environmental Regulatory Agencies in Brazil to derive WQC based on native species. In this context, the present paper discusses the historical evolution of ecotoxicological studies in Brazil, and how they have contributed to the improvement of the Brazilian Federal and Regional regulations for environment.",1,

The main target for researchers and breeding is the improvement of maize quality and yield. The use of computational biology methods combined with multi-omics for selecting biomolecules of interest for maize breeding has been receiving more attention. Moreover, the rapid growth of high-throughput sequencing data provides the opportunity to explore biomolecules of interest at the molecular level in maize. Furthermore, we constructed weighted networks for each of the omics and then integrated them into a final fused weighted network based on a nonlinear combination method. We also analyzed the final fused network and mined the orphan nodes, some of which were shown to be transcription factors that played a key role in maize development. This study could help to improve maize production via insights at the multi-omics level and provide a new perspective for maize researchers.

27340894,Feasibility of Deploying Inhaler Sensors to Identify the Impacts of Environmental Triggers and Built Environment Factors on Asthma Short-Acting Bronchodilator Use.,"<h4>Background</h4>Epidemiological asthma research has relied upon self-reported symptoms or healthcare utilization data, and used the residential address as the primary location for exposure. These data sources can be temporally limited, spatially aggregated, subjective, and burdensome for the patient to collect.<h4>Objectives</h4>First, we aimed to test the feasibility of collecting rescue inhaler use data in space-time using electronic sensors. Second, we aimed to evaluate whether these data have the potential to identify environmental triggers and built environment factors associated with rescue inhaler use and to determine whether these findings would be consistent with the existing literature.<h4>Methods</h4>We utilized zero-truncated negative binomial models to identify triggers associated with inhaler use, and implemented three sensitivity analyses to validate our findings.<h4>Results</h4>Electronic sensors fitted on metered dose inhalers tracked 5,660 rescue inhaler use events in space and time for 140 participants from 13 June 2012 to 28 February 2014. We found that the inhaler sensors were feasible in passively collecting objective rescue inhaler use data. We identified several environmental triggers with a positive and significant association with inhaler use, including: AQI, PM10, weed pollen, and mold. Conversely, the spatial distribution of tree cover demonstrated a negative and significant association with inhaler use.<h4>Conclusions</h4>Utilizing a sensor to capture the signal of rescue inhaler use in space-time offered a passive and objective signal of asthma activity. This approach enabled detailed analyses to identify environmental triggers and built environment factors that are associated with asthma symptoms beyond the residential address. The application of these new technologies has the potential to improve our surveillance and understanding of asthma.

32713858,PRIGSA2: Improved version of protein repeat identification by graph spectral analysis.,"Tandemly repeated structural motifs in proteins form highly stable structural folds and provide multiple binding sites associated with diverse functional roles. The tertiary structure and function of these proteins are determined by the type and copy number of the repeating units. Each repeat type exhibits a unique pattern of intra- and inter-repeat unit interactions that is well-captured by the topological features in the network representation of protein structures. Here we present an improved version of our graph based algorithm, PRIGSA, with structure-based validation and filtering steps incorporated for accurate detection of tandem structural repeats. The algorithm integrates available knowledge on repeat families with de novo prediction to detect repeats in single monomer chains as well as in multimeric protein complexes. Three levels of performance evaluation are presented: comparison with state-of-the-art algorithms on benchmark dataset of repeat and nonrepeat proteins, accuracy in the detection of members of 13 known repeat families reported in UniProt and execution on the complete Protein Data Bank to show its ability to identify previously uncharacterized proteins. A ~3-fold increase in the coverage of the members of 13 known families and 3408 novel uncharacterized structural repeat proteins are identified on executing it on PDB.

32546899,Hypersensitivity reactions to biologics (part I): allergy as an important differential diagnosis in complex immune-derived adverse events.,"<b>Purpose:</b> Biotechnological substances (BSs) are strongly relied upon to prevent rejection of transplanted organs, and to treat oncological, allergological, and other inflammatory diseases. Allergic reactions to partly foreign biologics can occur due to their potential immunogenicity. The severity of an immune response to a biological drug may range from no clinical significance to a severe, life-threatening anaphylactic reaction.<b>Methods:</b> Detailed searches were performed on Pubmed, Web of Science, and Google Scholar to include all available publications. In addition, the Food and Drug Administration, the European Medicines Agency, and British Columbia Cancer Agency Drug Manual databases were screened for hypersensitivity reaction (HSR), infusion reaction, injection site reaction, urticaria, and anaphylaxis for individual BSs.<b>Results:</b> Treatment with BSs can cause various types of HSR. These are mentioned in the literature with definitions such as allergic reactions, anaphylactoid reactions, anaphylaxis, HSR, infusion reactions, injection site reactions, cytokine release syndrome, and urticaria. Due to the overlap in signs and symptoms in the reported descriptions, it is not always possible to differentiate these reactions properly according to their pathomechanism. Similarly, many data reported as anaphylaxis actually describe severe anaphylactic reactions (grades III or IV).<b>Conclusion:</b> There is an urgent need for a simpler symptom- or system-based classification and scoring system to create an awareness for HSRs to BSs. A better understanding of the pathophysiology of HSRs and increased clinical experience in the treatment of side effects will provide timely control of unexpected reactions. As a result, immunotherapy with BSs will become safer in the future.<b>Cite this as G¸lsen A</b>, <b>Wedi B</b>, <b>Jappe U.

32186404,"Uterine Patterning, Endometrial Gland Development, and Implantation Failure in Mice Exposed Neonatally to Genistein.","BACKGROUND:Embryo implantation relies on precise hormonal regulation, associated gene expression changes, and appropriate female reproductive tract tissue architecture. Female mice exposed neonatally to the phytoestrogen genistein (GEN) at doses similar to those in infants consuming soy-based infant formulas are infertile due in part to uterine implantation defects. OBJECTIVES:Our goal was to determine the mechanisms by which neonatal GEN exposure causes implantation defects. METHODS:Female mice were exposed to GEN on postnatal days (PND)1-5 and uterine tissues collected on PND5, PND22-26, and during pregnancy. Analysis of tissue weights, morphology, and gene expression was performed using standard histology, confocal imaging with three-dimensional analysis, real-time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (real-time RT-PCR), and microarrays. The response of ovariectomized adults to 17ﬂ-estradiol (E2) and artificial decidualization were measured. Leukemia inhibitory factor (LIF) injections were given intraperitoneally and implantation sites visualized. Gene expression patterns were compared with curated data sets to identify upstream regulators. RESULTS:GEN-exposed mice exhibited reduced uterine weight gain in response to E2 treatment or artificial decidualization compared with controls; however, expression of select hormone responsive genes remained similar between the two groups. Uteri from pregnant GEN-exposed mice were posteriorized and had reduced glandular epithelium. Implantation failure was not rescued by LIF administration. Microarray analysis of GEN-exposed uteri during early pregnancy revealed significant overlap with several conditional uterine knockout mouse models, including Foxa2, Wnt4, and Sox17. These models exhibit reduced endometrial glands, features of posteriorization and implantation failure. Expression of Foxa2, Wnt4, and Sox17, as well as genes important for neonatal uterine differentiation (Wnt7a, Hoxa10, and Msx2), were severely disrupted on PND5 in GEN-exposed mice. DISCUSSION:Our findings suggest that neonatal GEN exposure in mice disrupts expression of genes important for uterine development, causing posteriorization and diminished gland function during pregnancy that contribute to implantation failure. These findings could have implications for women who consumed soy-based formulas as infants. https://doi.org/10.1289/EHP6336.",0,

23853063,Exhaustively characterizing feasible logic models of a signaling network using Answer Set Programming.,"<h4>Motivation</h4>Logic modeling is a useful tool to study signal transduction across multiple pathways. Logic models can be generated by training a network containing the prior knowledge to phospho-proteomics data. The training can be performed using stochastic optimization procedures, but these are unable to guarantee a global optima or to report the complete family of feasible models. This, however, is essential to provide precise insight in the mechanisms underlaying signal transduction and generate reliable predictions.<h4>Results</h4>We propose the use of Answer Set Programming to explore exhaustively the space of feasible logic models. Toward this end, we have developed caspo, an open-source Python package that provides a powerful platform to learn and characterize logic models by leveraging the rich modeling language and solving technologies of Answer Set Programming. We illustrate the usefulness of caspo by revisiting a model of pro-growth and inflammatory pathways in liver cells. We show that, if experimental error is taken into account, there are thousands (11 700) of models compatible with the data. Despite the large number, we can extract structural features from the models, such as links that are always (or never) present or modules that appear in a mutual exclusive fashion. To further characterize this family of models, we investigate the input-output behavior of the models. We find 91 behaviors across the 11 700 models and we suggest new experiments to discriminate among them. Our results underscore the importance of characterizing in a global and exhaustive manner the family of feasible models, with important implications for experimental design.<h4>Availability</h4>caspo is freely available for download (license GPLv3) and as a web service at http://caspo.genouest.org/.<h4>Supplementary information</h4>Supplementary materials are available at Bioinformatics online.<h4>Contact</h4>santiago.videla@irisa.fr.",0,

22848493,"qPMS7: a fast algorithm for finding (‚Ñì, d)-motifs in DNA and protein sequences.","Detection of rare events happening in a set of DNA/protein sequences could lead to new biological discoveries. One kind of such rare events is the presence of patterns called motifs in DNA/protein sequences. Finding motifs is a challenging problem since the general version of motif search has been proven to be intractable. Motifs discovery is an important problem in biology. For example, it is useful in the detection of transcription factor binding sites and transcriptional regulatory elements that are very crucial in understanding gene function, human disease, drug design, etc. Many versions of the motif search problem have been proposed in the literature. One such is the (l, d)-motif search (or Planted Motif Search (PMS)). A generalized version of the PMS problem, namely, Quorum Planted Motif Search (qPMS), is shown to accurately model motifs in real data. However, solving the qPMS problem is an extremely difficult task because a special case of it, the PMS Problem, is already NP-hard, which means that any algorithm solving it can be expected to take exponential time in the worse case scenario. In this paper, we propose a novel algorithm named qPMS7 that tackles the qPMS problem on real data as well as challenging instances. Experimental results show that our Algorithm qPMS7 is on an average 5 times faster than the state-of-art algorithm. The executable program of Algorithm qPMS7 is freely available on the web at http://pms.engr.uconn.edu/downloads/qPMS7.zip. Our online motif discovery tools that use Algorithm qPMS7 are freely available at http://pms.engr.uconn.edu or http://motifsearch.com.",0,
33042605,LibMI: An Open Source Library for Efficient Histopathological Image Processing.,"<h4>Background</h4>Whole-slide images (WSIs) as a kind of image data are rapidly growing in the digital pathology domain. With unusual high resolution, these images make them hard to be supported by conventional tools or file formats. Thus, it obstructs data sharing and automated analysis. Here, we propose a library, LibMI, along with its open and standardized image file format. They can be used together to efficiently read, write, modify, and annotate large images.<h4>Materials and methods</h4>LibMI utilizes the concept of pyramid image structure and lazy propagation from a segment tree algorithm to support reading and modifying and to guarantee that both operations have linear time complexity. Further, a cache mechanism was introduced to speed up the program.<h4>Results</h4>LibMI is an open and efficient library for histopathological image processing. To demonstrate its functions, we applied it to several tasks including image thresholding, microscopic color correction, and storing pixel-wise information on WSIs. The result shows that libMI is particularly suitable for modifying large images. Furthermore, compared with congeneric libraries and file formats, libMI and modifiable multiscale image (MMSI) run 18.237 times faster on read-only tasks.<h4>Conclusions</h4>The combination of libMI library and MMSI file format enables developers to efficiently read and modify WSIs, thus can assist in pixel-wise image processing on extremely large images to promote building image processing pipeline. The library together with the data schema is freely available on GitLab: https://gitlab.com/BioAI/libMI.",0,
22014078,"Inputs to quality: supervision, management, and community involvement in health facilities in Egypt in 2004.","<h4>Background</h4>As low- and middle-income countries experience economic development, ensuring quality of health care delivery is a central component of health reform. Nevertheless, health reforms in low- and middle-income countries have focused more on access to services rather than the quality of these services, and reporting on quality has been limited. In the present study, we sought to examine the prevalence and regional variation in key management practices in Egyptian health facilities within three domains: supervision of the facility from the Ministry of Health and Population (MOHP), managerial processes, and patient and community involvement in care.<h4>Methods</h4>We conducted a cross-sectional analysis of data from 559 facilities surveyed with the Egyptian Service Provision Assessment (ESPA) survey in 2004, the most recent such survey in Egypt. We registered on the Measure Demographic and Health Survey (DHS) website http://legacy.measuredhs.com/login.cfm to gain access to the survey data. From the ESPA sampled 559 MOHP facilities, we excluded a total of 79 facilities because they did not offer facility-based 24-hour care or have at least one physician working in the facility, resulting in a final sample of 480 facilities. The final sample included 76 general service hospitals, 307 rural health units, and 97 maternal and child health and urban health units (MCH/urban units). We used standard frequency analyses to describe facility characteristics and tested the statistical significance of regional differences using chi-square statistics.<h4>Results</h4>Nearly all facilities reported having external supervision within the 6 months preceding the interview. In contrast, key facility-level managerial processes, such as having routine and documented management meetings and applying quality assurance approaches, were uncommon. Involvement of communities and patients was also reported in a minority of facilities. Hospitals and health units located in Urban Egypt compared with more rural parts of Egypt were significantly more likely to have management committees that met at least monthly, to keep official records of the meetings, and to have an approach for reviewing quality assurance activities.<h4>Conclusions</h4>Although the data precede the recent reform efforts of the MOHP, they provide a baseline against which future progress can be measured. Targeted efforts to improve facility-level management are critical to supporting quality improvement initiatives directed at improving the quality of health care throughout the country.",0,
32750793,Index Networks.,"We show that existing upsampling operators can be unified using the notion of the index function. This notion is inspired by an observation in the decoding process of deep image matting where indices-guided unpooling can often recover boundary details considerably better than other upsampling operators such as bilinear interpolation. By viewing the indices as a function of the feature map, we introduce the concept of 'learning to index', and present a novel index-guided encoder-decoder framework where indices are learned adaptively from data and are used to guide downsampling and upsampling stages, without extra training supervision. At the core of this framework is a new learnable module, termed Index Network (IndexNet), which dynamically generates indices conditioned on the feature map. IndexNet can be used as a plug-in applicable to almost all convolutional networks that have coupled downsampling and upsampling stages, enabling the networks to dynamically capture variations of local patterns. In particular, we instantiate, investigate five families of IndexNet, highlight their superiority in delivering spatial information over other upsampling operators with experiments on synthetic data, and demonstrate their effectiveness on four dense prediction tasks, including image matting, image denoising, semantic segmentation, and monocular depth estimation.

PMC7989604,"112 Outcomes and Clinical Characteristics of COVID-19 Disease in the Frail, Elderly Population of Tayside","Abstract <h4>Introduction</h4> With advancing age, frailty, multi-morbidity and need for care, elderly patients are some of the most vulnerable to Covid-19 disease. In NHS Tayside, a dedicated Covid-19 Medicine for the Elderly (MFE) Team was formed to care for patients identified as frail and likely to benefit from comprehensive geriatric assessment. <h4>Methods</h4> All Covid-19 patients meeting frailty criteria1, cared for by the Covid-19 MFE Team were identified. Data on outcomes and clinical characteristics for all (140) patients admitted during the first pandemic wave (MarchñJuly 2020) was collected using electronic patient records and analysed. <h4>Results</h4> Patients were predominantly male (58.6%). Ages ranged from 65ñ99†years, with 43.6% aged =85†years. 82.1% had one or more of cough, fever and anosmia on admission fitting Covid-19 case definition 2. Lymphopenia was present in 92.1%. Of note, 26.5% of patients had a normal or unchanged chest x-ray report, with only 10.2% showing bilateral peripheral infiltrates. 28-day mortality was 37.1% with Covid-19 Disease listed as primary cause of death in 90.4%. <h4>Conclusion(s)</h4> Entering further ìwavesî of infection, it is vital that we understand the clinical presentation and course of Covid-19 disease in elderly patients. Our data highlights that any Covid-19 symptom, even in isolation, should raise suspicion of disease. Chest x-rays should not be used alone as a diagnostic tool. The presence of lymphopenia should raise suspicion of Covid-19 infection. In developing an understanding of how elderly patients with Covid-19 present, we can ensure early identification and initiation of appropriate infection control measures. <h4>References</h4> 1.

22210604,Discovery and mapping of a new expressed sequence tag-single nucleotide polymorphism and simple sequence repeat panel for large-scale genetic studies and breeding of Theobroma cacao L.,"Theobroma cacao is an economically important tree of several tropical countries. Its genetic improvement is essential to provide protection against major diseases and improve chocolate quality. We discovered and mapped new expressed sequence tag-single nucleotide polymorphism (EST-SNP) and simple sequence repeat (SSR) markers and constructed a high-density genetic map. By screening 149 650 ESTs, 5246 SNPs were detected in silico, of which 1536 corresponded to genes with a putative function, while 851 had a clear polymorphic pattern across a collection of genetic resources. In addition, 409 new SSR markers were detected on the Criollo genome. Lastly, 681 new EST-SNPs and 163 new SSRs were added to the pre-existing 418 co-dominant markers to construct a large consensus genetic map. This high-density map and the set of new genetic markers identified in this study are a milestone in cocoa genomics and for marker-assisted breeding.

27660889,MINFIT: A Spreadsheet-Based Tool for Parameter Estimation in an Equilibrium Speciation Software Program.,"Determination of equilibrium constants describing chemical reactions in the aqueous phase and at solid-water interface relies on inverse modeling and parameter estimation. Although there are existing tools available, the steep learning curve prevents the wider community of environmental engineers and chemists to adopt those tools. Stemming from classical chemical equilibrium codes, MINEQL+ has been one of the most widely used chemical equilibrium software programs. We developed a spreadsheet-based tool, which we are calling MINFIT, that interacts with MINEQL+ to perform parameter estimations that optimize model fits to experimental data sets. MINFIT enables automatic and convenient screening of a large number of parameter sets toward the optimal solutions by calling MINEQL+ to perform iterative forward calculations following either exhaustive equidistant grid search or randomized search algorithms. The combined use of the two algorithms can securely guide the searches for the global optima. We developed interactive interfaces so that the optimization processes are transparent. Benchmark examples including both aqueous and surface complexation problems illustrate the parameter estimation and associated sensitivity analysis.

31706268,Genome-wide prediction and prioritization of human aging genes by data fusion: a machine learning approach.,"BACKGROUND:Machine learning can effectively nominate novel genes for various research purposes in the laboratory. On a genome-wide scale, we implemented multiple databases and algorithms to predict and prioritize the human aging genes (PPHAGE). RESULTS:We fused data from 11 databases, and used NaÔve Bayes classifier and positive unlabeled learning (PUL) methods, NB, Spy, and Rocchio-SVM, to rank human genes in respect with their implication in aging. The PUL methods enabled us to identify a list of negative (non-aging) genes to use alongside the seed (known age-related) genes in the ranking process. Comparison of the PUL algorithms revealed that none of the methods for identifying a negative sample were advantageous over other methods, and their simultaneous use in a form of fusion was critical for obtaining optimal results (PPHAGE is publicly available at https://cbb.ut.ac.ir/pphage). CONCLUSION:We predict and prioritize over 3,000 candidate age-related genes in human, based on significant ranking scores. The identified candidate genes are associated with pathways, ontologies, and diseases that are linked to aging, such as cancer and diabetes. Our data offer a platform for future experimental research on the genetic and biological aspects of aging. Additionally, we demonstrate that fusion of PUL methods and data sources can be successfully used for aging and disease candidate gene prioritization.",1,

27378299,Icarus: visualizer for de novo assembly evaluation.,": Data visualization plays an increasingly important role in NGS data analysis. With advances in both sequencing and computational technologies, it has become a new bottleneck in genomics studies. Indeed, evaluation of de novo genome assemblies is one of the areas that can benefit from the visualization. However, even though multiple quality assessment methods are now available, existing visualization tools are hardly suitable for this purpose. Here, we present Icarus-a novel genome visualizer for accurate assessment and analysis of genomic draft assemblies, which is based on the tool QUAST.

29351546,Accessing an Expanded Exposure Science Module at the Comparative Toxicogenomics Database.,"SUMMARY:The Comparative Toxicogenomics Database (CTD; http://ctdbase.org) is a free resource that provides manually curated information on chemical, gene, phenotype, and disease relationships to advance understanding of the effect of environmental exposures on human health. Four core content areas are independently curated: chemical-gene interactions, chemical-disease and gene-disease associations, chemical-phenotype interactions, and environmental exposure data (e.g., effects of chemical stressors on humans). Since releasing exposure data in 2015, we have vastly increased our coverage of chemicals and disease/phenotype outcomes; greatly expanded access to exposure content; added search capability by stressors, cohorts, population demographics, and measured outcomes; and created user-specified displays of content. These enhancements aim to facilitate human studies by allowing comparisons among experimental parameters and across studies involving specified chemicals, populations, or outcomes. Integration of data among CTD's four content areas and external data sets, such as Gene Ontology annotations and pathway information, links exposure data with over 1.8 million chemical-gene, chemical-disease and gene-disease interactions. Our analysis tools reveal direct and inferred relationships among the data and provide opportunities to generate predictive connections between environmental exposures and population-level health outcomes. https://doi.org/10.1289/EHP2873.",1,

29890119,FlyXCDB-A Resource for Drosophila Cell Surface and Secreted Proteins and Their Extracellular Domains.,"Genomes of metazoan organisms possess a large number of genes encoding cell surface and secreted (CSS) proteins that carry out crucial functions in cell adhesion and communication, signal transduction, extracellular matrix establishment, nutrient digestion and uptake, immunity, and developmental processes. We developed the FlyXCDB database (http://prodata.swmed.edu/FlyXCDB) that provides a comprehensive resource to investigate extracellular (XC) domains in CSS proteins of Drosophila melanogaster, the most studied insect model organism in various aspects of animal biology. More than 300 Drosophila XC domains were discovered in Drosophila CSS proteins encoded by over 2500 genes through analyses of computational predictions of signal peptide, transmembrane (TM) segment, and GPI-anchor signal sequence, profile-based sequence similarity searches, gene ontology, and literature. These domains were classified into six classes mainly based on their molecular functions, including protein-protein interactions (class P), signaling molecules (class S), binding of non-protein molecules or groups (class B), enzyme homologs (class E), enzyme regulation and inhibition (class R), and unknown molecular function (class U). Main cellular functions such as cell adhesion, cell signaling, and extracellular matrix composition were described for the most abundant domains in each functional class. We assigned cell membrane topology categories (E, secreted; S, type I/III single-pass TM; T, type II single-pass TM; M, multi-pass TM; and G, GPI-anchored) to the products of genes with XC domains and investigated their regulation by mechanisms such as alternative splicing and stop codon readthrough.",1,
30722630,First Report of Powdery Mildew Caused by Erysiphe platani on Sycamore (Platanus occidentalis) in South Korea.,"Platanus occidentalis L. (sycamore) is an important shade tree distributed throughout the Northern Hemisphere and in South Korea. It has been widely used as an ornamental tree, especially in urban regions and by roadsides. The average rate of roadside planting throughout South Korea covers about 5.7% (up to 38% in Seoul), equivalent to 0.36 million trees. In early July 2012, after a rainy spell in summer, an outbreak of powdery mildew on sycamore was first observed on roadside trees in Gwangju, a southern province of South Korea. A more extensive nationwide survey revealed no powdery mildew in northern or central regions of South Korea. The disease has spread rapidly within Gwangju, even though fungicide applications were carried out after the rainy spell. Major symptoms included white, superficial mycelia, grey to brown lesions on the surface of the leaves due to the presence of a hyperparasite (tentatively identified as Ampelomyces sp.), a slight chlorosis, and severe leaf distortion followed by defoliation. Conidiophores were produced singly, straight, and unbranched, with lengths of 35.2 to 315.2 µm (average 170.4 µm). Conidia were ellipsoid or doliiform, ranging in size from 34.9 to 47.4 µm (average 38.2 µm) long ◊ 16.5 to 26.8 µm (average 23.9 µm) wide. Primary conidia had a truncate base and rounded apex; secondary conidia had both a truncate base and apex. The conidial outer surface had a reticulated wrinkling. Cleistothecia (i.e., sexual spore structures) were not found during the survey, which extended from July to October. These characteristics and the host species match those of Microsphaera platani (syn. Erysiphe platani), which was described on P. occidentalis in Washington State (2). Fungal rDNA was amplified using primers ITS1 and LR5F (4) for one sample (EML-PLA1, GenBank JX485651). BLASTn searches of GenBank revealed high sequence identity to E. platani (99.5% to JQ365943 and 99.3% to JQ365940). Recently, Liang et al. (3) reported the first occurrence of powdery mildew by E. platani on P. orientalis in China based only on its morphology. Thus, in this study, author could only use ITS sequence data from the United States and Europe to characterize the isolate. To date, nine records of powdery mildews of Platanus spp. have been reported worldwide: on P. hispanica from Brazil, Japan, Hungary, and Slovakia; P. orientalis from Israel; P. racemosa from the United States; P. ◊ acerifolia from the United Kingdom and Germany; and Platanus sp. from Argentina and Australia (1). Interestingly, the hyperparasite, Ampelomyces sp., was found with E. platani, suggesting that there may be some level of biocontrol in nature. Pathogenicity was confirmed by gently pressing diseased leaves onto six leaves of healthy sycamore plants in the field in September. The treated leaves were sealed in sterilized vinyl pack to maintain humid condition for 2 days. Similar symptoms were observed on the inoculated leaves 10 days after inoculation. Koch's postulates were fulfilled by re-observing the fungal pathogen. To our knowledge, this is the first report of powdery mildew caused by E. platani on sycamore in South Korea. References: (1) D.

30572878,"Geographical mobility of UK trainee doctors, from family home to first job: a national cohort study.","<h4>Background</h4>The UK faces geographical variation in the recruitment of doctors. Understanding where medical graduates choose to go for training is important because doctors are more likely to consider practicing in areas where they completed postgraduate training. The wider literature also suggests that there is a relationship between origin and background, and where doctors wish to train/work. Thus, the purpose of this paper is to investigate the geographical mobility of UK medical graduates from different socio-economic groups in terms of where they wish to spend their first years of postgraduate training.<h4>Methods</h4>This was an observational study of Foundation Programme (FP) doctors who graduated from 33 UK medical schools between 2012 and 2014. Data was accessed via the UK medical education database (UKMED: https://www.ukmed.ac.uk/ ). Chi-square tests were used to examine the relationships between doctor's sociodemographic characteristics and the dependent variable, average driving time from parental home to foundation school/region. Generalised Linear Mixed Models (GLMM) were used to estimate the effects of those factors in combination against the outcome measure.<h4>Results</h4>The majority of doctors prefer to train at foundation schools that are reasonably close to the family home. Those who attended state-funded schools, from non-white ethnic groups and/or from lower socio-economic groups were significantly more likely to choose foundation schools nearer their parental home. Doctors from disadvantaged backgrounds (as determined by entitlement to free school meals, OR = 1.29, p†= 0.003 and no parental degree, OR = 1.34, p†< 0.001) were associated with higher odds of selecting a foundation schools that were closer to parental home.<h4>Conclusion</h4>The data suggests that recruiting medical students from lower socioeconomic groups and those who originate from under-recruiting areas may be at least part of the solution to filling training posts in these areas. This has obvious implications for the widening access agenda, and equitable distribution of health services.",0,
24367574,Switch of sensitivity dynamics revealed with DyGloSA toolbox for dynamical global sensitivity analysis as an early warning for system's critical transition.,"Systems with bifurcations may experience abrupt irreversible and often unwanted shifts in their performance, called critical transitions. For many systems like climate, economy, ecosystems it is highly desirable to identify indicators serving as early warnings of such regime shifts. Several statistical measures were recently proposed as early warnings of critical transitions including increased variance, autocorrelation and skewness of experimental or model-generated data. The lack of automatized tool for model-based prediction of critical transitions led to designing DyGloSA - a MATLAB toolbox for dynamical global parameter sensitivity analysis (GPSA) of ordinary differential equations models. We suggest that the switch in dynamics of parameter sensitivities revealed by our toolbox is an early warning that a system is approaching a critical transition. We illustrate the efficiency of our toolbox by analyzing several models with bifurcations and predicting the time periods when systems can still avoid going to a critical transition by manipulating certain parameter values, which is not detectable with the existing SA techniques. DyGloSA is based on the SBToolbox2 and contains functions, which compute dynamically the global sensitivity indices of the system by applying four main GPSA methods: eFAST, Sobol's ANOVA, PRCC and WALS. It includes parallelized versions of the functions enabling significant reduction of the computational time (up to 12 times). DyGloSA is freely available as a set of MATLAB scripts at http://bio.uni.lu/systems_biology/software/dyglosa. It requires installation of MATLAB (versions R2008b or later) and the Systems Biology Toolbox2 available at www.sbtoolbox2.org. DyGloSA can be run on Windows and Linux systems, -32 and -64 bits.",0,

It can smoothly navigate the protein structure space in real-time from one query structure to another. A major new feature of Release 2.0 is the ability to compare the protein surface of a single chain, a single domain, or a single complex against databases of protein chains, domains, complexes, or a combination of all three in the latest PDB. Additionally, two types of protein structures can now be compared: all-atom-surface and backbone-atom-surface. The server can also accept a batch job for a large number of database searches. Pockets in protein surfaces can be identified by VisGrid and LIGSITE (csc) . The server is available at http://kiharalab.org/3d-surfer/.",0,

In this paper, we present measurements of the chromatographic hydrophobicity index (CHI) on a subset of the French chemical library ChimiothËque Nationale (CN). The data were used in quantitative structure-property relationship (QSPR) modeling in order to annotate the CN. An algorithm is proposed to detect problematic molecules with large prediction errors, called outliers. In order to find an explanation for these large discrepancies between predicted and experimental values, these compounds were reanalyzed experimentally. As the first selected outliers indeed had experimental problems, including hydrolysis or sheer absence of expected structure, we herewith propose the use of QSPR as a support tool for quality control of screening data and encourage cooperation between experimental and theoretical teams to improve results. The corrected data were used to produce a model, which is freely available on our web server at http://infochim.u-strasbg.fr/webserv/VSEngine.html .",0,

The ConTemplate web server (http://bental.tau.ac.il/contemplate) exploits these observations to suggest conformations for a query protein with at least one known conformation (or model thereof). We demonstrate ConTemplate on a ribose-binding protein that undergoes significant conformational changes upon substrate binding. Querying ConTemplate with the ligand-free (or bound) structure of the protein produces the ligand-bound (or free) conformation with a root-mean-square deviation of 1.7†≈ (or 2.2†≈); the models are derived from conformations of other sugar-binding proteins, sharing approximately 30% sequence identity with the query. The calculation also suggests intermediate conformations and a pathway between the bound and free conformations.",0,
29512488,S2P: A software tool to quickly carry out reproducible biomedical research projects involving 2D-gel and MALDI-TOF MS protein data.,"<h4>Background and objective</h4>2D-gel electrophoresis is widely used in combination with MALDI-TOF mass spectrometry in order to analyze the proteome of biological samples. For instance, it can be used to discover proteins that are differentially expressed between two groups (e.g. two disease conditions, case vs. control, etc.) thus obtaining a set of potential biomarkers. This procedure requires a great deal of data processing in order to prepare data for analysis or to merge and integrate data from different sources. This kind of work is usually done manually (e.g. copying and pasting data into spreadsheet files), which is highly time consuming and distracts the researcher from other important, core tasks. Moreover, engaging in a repetitive process in a non-automated, handling-based manner is prone to error, thus threatening reliability and reproducibility. The objective of this paper is to present S2P, an open source software to overcome these drawbacks.<h4>Methods</h4>S2P is implemented in Java on top of the AIBench framework, and relies on well-established open source libraries to accomplish different tasks.<h4>Results</h4>S2P is an AIBench based desktop multiplatform application, specifically aimed to process 2D-gel and MALDI-mass spectrometry protein identification-based data in a computer-aided, reproducible manner. Different case studies are presented in order to show the usefulness of S2P.<h4>Conclusions</h4>S2P is open source and free to all users at http://www.sing-group.org/s2p. Through its user-friendly GUI interface, S2P dramatically reduces the time that researchers need to invest in order to prepare data for analysis.",0,
25348213,DIANA--algorithmic improvements for analysis of data-independent acquisition MS data.,"<h4>Motivation</h4>Data independent acquisition mass spectrometry has emerged as a reproducible and sensitive alternative in quantitative proteomics, where parsing the highly complex tandem mass spectra requires dedicated algorithms. Recently, targeted data extraction was proposed as a novel analysis strategy for this type of data, but it is important to further develop these concepts to provide quality-controlled, interference-adjusted and sensitive peptide quantification.<h4>Results</h4>We here present the algorithm DIANA and the classifier PyProphet, which are based on new probabilistic sub-scores to classify the chromatographic peaks in targeted data-independent acquisition data analysis. The algorithm is capable of providing accurate quantitative values and increased recall at a controlled false discovery rate, in a complex gold standard dataset. Importantly, we further demonstrate increased confidence gained by the use of two complementary data-independent acquisition targeted analysis algorithms, as well as increased numbers of quantified peptide precursors in complex biological samples.<h4>Availability and implementation</h4>DIANA is implemented in scala and python and available as open source (Apache 2.0 license) or pre-compiled binaries from http://quantitativeproteomics.org/diana. PyProphet can be installed from PyPi (https://pypi.python.org/pypi/pyprophet).<h4>Supplementary information</h4>Supplementary data are available at Bioinformatics online.",,

IND605724905,Omics analysis of acetic acid tolerance in Saccharomyces cerevisiae,"Acetic acid is an inhibitor in industrial processes such as wine making and bioethanol production from cellulosic hydrolysate. It causes energy depletion, inhibition of metabolic enzyme activity, growth arrest and ethanol productivity losses in Saccharomyces cerevisiae. Therefore, understanding the mechanisms of the yeast responses to acetic acid stress is essential for improving acetic acid tolerance and ethanol production. Although 329 genes associated with acetic acid tolerance have been identified in the Saccharomyces genome and included in the database (http://www.yeastgenome.org/observable/resistance_to_acetic_acid/overview), the cellular mechanistic responses to acetic acid remain unclear in this organism. Post-genomic approaches such as transcriptomics, proteomics, metabolomics and chemogenomics are being applied to yeast and are providing insight into the mechanisms and interactions of genes, proteins and other components that together determine complex quantitative phenotypic traits such as acetic acid tolerance. This review focuses on these omics approaches in the response to acetic acid in S. cerevisiae. Additionally, several novel strains with improved acetic acid tolerance have been engineered by modifying key genes, and the application of these strains and recently acquired knowledge to industrial processes is also discussed.",0,
25952609,Heterozygous genome assembly via binary classification of homologous sequence.,"<h4>Background</h4>Genome assemblers to date have predominantly targeted haploid reference reconstruction from homozygous data. When applied to diploid genome assembly, these assemblers perform poorly, owing to the violation of assumptions during both the contigging and scaffolding phases. Effective tools to overcome these problems are in growing demand. Increasing parameter stringency during contigging is an effective solution to obtaining haplotype-specific contigs; however, effective algorithms for scaffolding such contigs are lacking.<h4>Methods</h4>We present a stand-alone scaffolding algorithm, ScaffoldScaffolder, designed specifically for scaffolding diploid genomes. The algorithm identifies homologous sequences as found in ""bubble"" structures in scaffold graphs. Machine learning classification is used to then classify sequences in partial bubbles as homologous or non-homologous sequences prior to reconstructing haplotype-specific scaffolds. We define four new metrics for assessing diploid scaffolding accuracy: contig sequencing depth, contig homogeneity, phase group homogeneity, and heterogeneity between phase groups.<h4>Results</h4>We demonstrate the viability of using bubbles to identify heterozygous homologous contigs, which we term homolotigs. We show that machine learning classification trained on these homolotig pairs can be used effectively for identifying homologous sequences elsewhere in the data with high precision (assuming error-free reads).<h4>Conclusion</h4>More work is required to comparatively analyze this approach on real data with various parameters and classifiers against other diploid genome assembly methods. However, the initial results of ScaffoldScaffolder supply validity to the idea of employing machine learning in the difficult task of diploid genome assembly. Software is available at http://bioresearch.byu.edu/scaffoldscaffolder.",0,
34296017,Individual and community-level determinants of Iron-Folic Acid Intake for the recommended period among pregnant women in Ethiopia: A multilevel analysis.,"<h4>Background</h4>Iron-folic acid (IFA) intake for the recommended period during pregnancy reduces the risk of anemia and congenital anomalies. However, IFA intake for the recommended period is still very low in low-income countries including Ethiopia. Thus, the aim of this study was to assess both individual-and community-level determinants of IFA intake for the recommended period among pregnant women in Ethiopia.<h4>Methods</h4>Data were retrieved from the Demographic and Health Survey program's official database website (http://dhsprogram.com). A two-stage stratified cluster sampling technique was employed to conduct the 2016 Ethiopian Demographic and Health Survey. A sample of 3088 pregnant women who had received at least one dose of IFA in Ethiopia were included in this study. A multivariable multilevel logistic regression analysis model was fitted to identify the determinants of IFA intake below the recommended period [< 90 days] during pregnancy. Akaike's Information Criterion (AIC) was used during the model selection procedure.<h4>Results</h4>This study revealed that 87.6% [95% CI; 86.3%, 88.6%] of the women took IFA below the recommended period during the index pregnancy. After adjusting for the covariates: living in rural areas [AOR = 1.74: 95% CI 1.37, 2.50], and women's illiterate proportion [AOR = 1.43: 95% CI 1.06, 1.70] were community level factors. Whereas, primary education level [AOR = 0.63: 95% CI 0.40, 0.78], poorer wealth index [AOR = 1.53: 95% CI 1.08, 3.09], 4 + antenatal care visits [AOR = 0.43: 95% CI 0.31, 0.69], and receive nutritional counseling during pregnancy [AOR = 0.63: 95% CI 0.37, 0.84] were the individual-level factors of IFA intake below the recommended period during pregnancy.<h4>Conclusions</h4>In this study, nearly nine out of ten pregnant women did not take IFA for the recommended period. Thus, promoting recommended ANC visits, enhancing the quality of nutritional counseling, strengthening the expansion of media, and educate rural women towards the importance of optimal intake of IFA during pregnancy. Besides, the policymakers should design essential strategies based on identified barriers to improve the IFA intake for the recommended period.",0,
28137292,Correcting for cell-type effects in DNA methylation studies: reference-based method outperforms latent variable approaches in empirical studies.,"Based on an extensive simulation study, McGregor and colleagues recently recommended the use of surrogate variable analysis (SVA) to control for the confounding effects of cell-type heterogeneity in DNA methylation association studies in scenarios where no cell-type proportions are available. As their recommendation was mainly based on simulated data, we sought to replicate findings in two large-scale empirical studies. In our empirical data, SVA did not fully correct for cell-type effects, its performance was somewhat unstable, and it carried a risk of missing true signals caused by removing variation that might be linked to actual disease processes. By contrast, a reference-based correction method performed well and did not show these limitations. A disadvantage of this approach is that if reference methylomes are not (publicly) available, they will need to be generated once for a small set of samples. However, given the notable risk we observed for cell-type confounding, we argue that, to avoid introducing false-positive findings into the literature, it could be well worth making this investment.Please see related Correspondence article: https://genomebiology.biomedcentral.com/articles/10/1186/s13059-017-1149-7 and related Research article: https://genomebiology.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s13059-016-0935-y.",0,
32519765,A novel nonsense mutation of ZEB2 gene in a Chinese patient with Mowat-Wilson syndrome.,"<h4>Background</h4>Mowat-Wilson syndrome (MWS) is a rare genetic disorder characterized by intellectual disability, distinctive facial features, and multiple anomalies caused by haploinsufficiency of†the ZEB2†gene. We investigated the genetic causes of MWS in a 14-year-old girl who had characteristic features of MWS.<h4>Methods</h4>Clinical data and peripheral blood DNA samples were collected from the proband. Following extraction of genomic DNA, whole-exome sequencing was conducted to detect genetic variants. Bioinformatics†analysis was†carried†out†to predict†the†function of the mutant gene.<h4>Results</h4>Mutation analysis of the proband identified a novel nonsense mutation (c.250G†>†T, p.E84*) within exon 3 of the†ZEB2†gene. This novel alteration resulted in a termination codon at amino acid position 84, which was predicted to encode a truncated protein. This variant was not present in unrelated healthy control samples that were obtained from the exome sequence databases ExAc browser (http://exac.broadinstitute.org/) and gnomAD browser (http://gnomad.broadinstitute.org/). It is a novel variant that was determined to be a deleterious mutation according to the variant interpretation guidelines of the ACMG. The results of our study suggest that the p.E84* mutation in the†ZEB2†gene was probably the pathogenic mutation that caused MWS in the proband.<h4>Conclusions</h4>This study reports the novel mutation in the proband will provide a basic foundation for further investigations to elucidate the ZEB2-related mechanisms of MWS.",0,
25161236,Effects of small particle numbers on long-term behaviour in discrete biochemical systems.,"<h4>Motivation</h4>The functioning of many biological processes depends on the appearance of only a small number of a single molecular species. Additionally, the observation of molecular crowding leads to the insight that even a high number of copies of species do not guarantee their interaction. How single particles contribute to stabilizing biological systems is not well understood yet. Hence, we aim at determining the influence of single molecules on the long-term behaviour of biological systems, i.e. whether they can reach a steady state.<h4>Results</h4>We provide theoretical considerations and a tool to analyse Systems Biology Markup Language models for the possibility to stabilize because of the described effects. The theory is an extension of chemical organization theory, which we called discrete chemical organization theory. Furthermore we scanned the BioModels Database for the occurrence of discrete chemical organizations. To exemplify our method, we describe an application to the Template model of the mitotic spindle assembly checkpoint mechanism.<h4>Availability and implementation</h4>http://www.biosys.uni-jena.de/Services.html.<h4>Supplementary information</h4>Supplementary data are available at Bioinformatics online.",0,
26657893,"HRGRN: A Graph Search-Empowered Integrative Database of Arabidopsis Signaling Transduction, Metabolism and Gene Regulation Networks.","The biological networks controlling plant signal transduction, metabolism and gene regulation are composed of not only tens of thousands of genes, compounds, proteins and RNAs but also the complicated interactions and co-ordination among them. These networks play critical roles in many fundamental mechanisms, such as plant growth, development and environmental response. Although much is known about these complex interactions, the knowledge and data are currently scattered throughout the published literature, publicly available high-throughput data sets and third-party databases. Many 'unknown' yet important interactions among genes need to be mined and established through extensive computational analysis. However, exploring these complex biological interactions at the network level from existing heterogeneous resources remains challenging and time-consuming for biologists. Here, we introduce HRGRN, a graph search-empowered integrative database of Arabidopsis signal transduction, metabolism and gene regulatory networks. HRGRN utilizes Neo4j, which is a highly scalable graph database management system, to host large-scale biological interactions among genes, proteins, compounds and small RNAs that were either validated experimentally or predicted computationally. The associated biological pathway information was also specially marked for the interactions that are involved in the pathway to facilitate the investigation of cross-talk between pathways. Furthermore, HRGRN integrates a series of graph path search algorithms to discover novel relationships among genes, compounds, RNAs and even pathways from heterogeneous biological interaction data that could be missed by traditional SQL database search methods. Users can also build subnetworks based on known interactions. The outcomes are visualized with rich text, figures and interactive network graphs on web pages.

It provides instantaneous processing of the 3-D movement coordinates of up to 20 markers at a single instant. Available functions include (1) the setting of reference positions, areas, and trajectories of interest; (2) recording of the 3-D coordinates for each marker over the trial duration; and (3) the detection of events to use as triggers for external reinforcers (e.g., lights, sounds, or odors). Through fast online communication between the hardware controller and RTMocap, automatic trial selection is possible by means of either a preset or an adaptive criterion. Rapid preprocessing of signals is also provided, which includes artifact rejection, filtering, spline interpolation, and averaging.

29202050,One Size Doesn't Fit All: Measuring Individual Privacy in Aggregate Genomic Data.,"Even in the aggregate, genomic data can reveal sensitive information about individuals. We present a new model-based measure, PrivMAF, that provides provable privacy guarantees for aggregate data (namely minor allele frequencies) obtained from genomic studies. Unlike many previous measures that have been designed to measure the total privacy lost by all participants in a study, PrivMAF gives an individual privacy measure for each participant in the study, not just an average measure. These individual measures can then be combined to measure the worst case privacy loss in the study. Our measure also allows us to quantify the privacy gains achieved by perturbing the data, either by adding noise or binning. Our findings demonstrate that both perturbation approaches offer significant privacy gains. Moreover, we see that these privacy gains can be achieved while minimizing perturbation (and thus maximizing the utility) relative to stricter notions of privacy, such as differential privacy. We test PrivMAF using genotype data from the Wellcome Trust Case Control Consortium, providing a more nuanced understanding of the privacy risks involved in an actual genome-wide association studies. Interestingly, our analysis demonstrates that the privacy implications of releasing MAFs from a study can differ greatly from individual to individual. An implementation of our method is available at http://privmaf.csail.mit.edu.",0,
27307608,Convolutional neural network architectures for predicting DNA-protein binding.,"<h4>Motivation</h4>Convolutional neural networks (CNN) have outperformed conventional methods in modeling the sequence specificity of DNA-protein binding. Yet inappropriate CNN architectures can yield poorer performance than simpler models. Thus an in-depth understanding of how to match CNN architecture to a given task is needed to fully harness the power of CNNs for computational biology applications.<h4>Results</h4>We present a systematic exploration of CNN architectures for predicting DNA sequence binding using a large compendium of transcription factor datasets. We identify the best-performing architectures by varying CNN width, depth and pooling designs. We find that adding convolutional kernels to a network is important for motif-based tasks. We show the benefits of CNNs in learning rich higher-order sequence features, such as secondary motifs and local sequence context, by comparing network performance on multiple modeling tasks ranging in difficulty. We also demonstrate how careful construction of sequence benchmark datasets, using approaches that control potentially confounding effects like positional or motif strength bias, is critical in making fair comparisons between competing methods. We explore how to establish the sufficiency of training data for these learning tasks, and we have created a flexible cloud-based framework that permits the rapid exploration of alternative neural network architectures for problems in computational biology.<h4>Availability and implementation</h4>All the models analyzed are available at http://cnn.csail.mit.edu<h4>Contact</h4>gifford@mit.edu<h4>Supplementary information</h4>Supplementary data are available at Bioinformatics online.",0,
30202060,Terminal exon characterization with TECtool reveals an abundance of cell-specific isoforms.,"Sequencing of RNA 3' ends has uncovered numerous sites that do not correspond to the termination sites of known transcripts. Through their 3' untranslated regions, protein-coding RNAs interact with RNA-binding proteins and microRNAs, which regulate many properties, including RNA stability and subcellular localization. We developed the terminal exon characterization (TEC) tool ( http://tectool.unibas.ch ), which can be used with RNA-sequencing data from any species for which a genome annotation that includes sites of RNA cleavage and polyadenylation is available. We discovered hundreds of previously unknown isoforms and cell-type-specific terminal exons in human cells. Ribosome profiling data revealed that many of these isoforms were translated. By applying TECtool to single-cell sequencing data, we found that the newly identified isoforms were expressed in subpopulations of cells. Thus, TECtool enables the identification of previously unknown isoforms in well-studied cell systems and in rare cell types.",0,

23217202,Protein Nano-Object Integrator (ProNOI) for generating atomic style objects for molecular modeling.,"<h4>Background</h4>With the progress of nanotechnology, one frequently has to model biological macromolecules simultaneously with nano-objects. However, the atomic structures of the nano objects are typically not available or they are solid state entities. Because of that, the researchers have to investigate such nano systems by generating models of the nano objects in a manner that the existing software be able to carry the simulations. In addition, it should allow generating composite objects with complex shape by combining basic geometrical figures and embedding biological macromolecules within the system.<h4>Results</h4>Here we report the Protein Nano-Object Integrator (ProNOI) which allows for generating atomic-style geometrical objects with user desired shape and dimensions. Unlimited number of objects can be created and combined with biological macromolecules in Protein Data Bank (PDB) format file. Once the objects are generated, the users can use sliders to manipulate their shape, dimension and absolute position. In addition, the software offers the option to charge the objects with either specified surface or volumetric charge density and to model them with user-desired dielectric constants. According to the user preference, the biological macromolecule atoms can be assigned charges and radii according to four different force fields: Amber, Charmm, OPLS and PARSE. The biological macromolecules and the atomic-style objects are exported as a position, charge and radius (PQR) file, or if a default dielectric constant distribution is not selected, it is exported as a position, charge, radius and epsilon (PQRE) file. As illustration of the capabilities of the ProNOI, we created a composite object in a shape of a robot, aptly named the Clemson Robot, whose parts are charged with various volumetric charge densities and holds the barnase-barstar protein complex in its hand.<h4>Conclusions</h4>The Protein Nano-Object Integrator (ProNOI) is a convenient tool for generating atomic-style nano shapes in conjunction with biological macromolecule(s).

However, most of them are specific to either a quantification strategy (e.g. label-free or isotopic labelling) or a mass-spectrometry system (e.g. high or low resolution). In this context, we have developed MassChroQ (Mass Chromatogram Quantification), a versatile software that performs LC-MS data alignment and peptide quantification by peak area integration on extracted ion chromatograms. MassChroQ is suitable for quantification with or without labelling and is not limited to high-resolution systems. Peptides of interest (for example all the identified peptides) can be determined automatically, or manually by providing targeted m/z and retention time values. It can handle large experiments that include protein or peptide fractionation (as SDS-PAGE, 2-D LC). It is fully configurable. Every processing step is traceable, the produced data are in open standard formats and its modularity allows easy integration into proteomic pipelines. The output results are ready for use in statistical analyses. Evaluation of MassChroQ on complex label-free data obtained from low and high-resolution mass spectrometers showed low CVs for technical reproducibility (1.4%) and high coefficients of correlation to protein quantity (0.98). MassChroQ is freely available under the GNU General Public Licence v3.0 at http://pappso.inra.fr/bioinfo/masschroq/.",0,
33902704,The impact of sequencing depth on the inferred taxonomic composition and AMR gene content of metagenomic samples.,"<h4>Background</h4>Shotgun metagenomics is increasingly used to characterise microbial communities, particularly for the investigation of antimicrobial resistance (AMR) in different animal and environmental contexts. There are many different approaches for inferring the taxonomic composition and AMR gene content of complex community samples from shotgun metagenomic data, but there has been little work establishing the optimum sequencing depth, data processing and analysis methods for these samples. In this study we used shotgun metagenomics and sequencing of cultured isolates from the same samples to address these issues. We sampled three potential environmental AMR gene reservoirs (pig caeca, river sediment, effluent) and sequenced samples with shotgun metagenomics at high depth (~ 200 million reads per sample). Alongside this, we cultured single-colony isolates of Enterobacteriaceae from the same samples and used hybrid sequencing (short- and long-reads) to create high-quality assemblies for comparison to the metagenomic data. To automate data processing, we developed an open-source software pipeline, 'ResPipe'.<h4>Results</h4>Taxonomic profiling was much more stable to sequencing depth than AMR gene content. 1 million reads per sample was sufficient to achieve < 1% dissimilarity to the full taxonomic composition. However, at least 80 million reads per sample were required to recover the full richness of different AMR gene families present in the sample, and additional allelic diversity of AMR genes was still being discovered in effluent at 200 million reads per sample. Normalising the number of reads mapping to AMR genes using gene length and an exogenous spike of Thermus thermophilus DNA substantially changed the estimated gene abundance distributions. While the majority of genomic content from cultured isolates from effluent was recoverable using shotgun metagenomics, this was not the case for pig caeca or river sediment.<h4>Conclusions</h4>Sequencing depth and profiling method can critically affect the profiling of polymicrobial animal and environmental samples with shotgun metagenomics. Both sequencing of cultured isolates and shotgun metagenomics can recover substantial diversity that is not identified using the other methods. Particular consideration is required when inferring AMR gene content or presence by mapping metagenomic reads to a database. ResPipe, the open-source software pipeline we have developed, is freely available ( https://gitlab.com/hsgweon/ResPipe ).",0,
28985876,The readability of psychosocial wellness patient resources: improving surgical outcomes.,"<h4>Background</h4>Patient education is increasingly accessed with online resources and is essential for patient satisfaction and clinical outcomes. The average American adult reads at a seventh grade level, and the National Institute of Health (NIH) and the American Medical Association (AMA) recommend that information be written at a sixth-grade reading level. Health literacy plays an important role in the disease course and outcomes of all patients, including those with depression and likely other psychiatric disorders, although this is an area in need of further study. The purpose of this study was to collect and analyze written, online mental health resources on the Veterans Health Administration (VA) website, and other websites, using readability assessment instruments.<h4>Methods</h4>An internet search was performed to identify written patient education information regarding mental health from the VA (the VA Mental Health Website) and top-rated psychiatric hospitals. Seven mental health topics were included in the analysis: generalized anxiety disorder, bipolar, major depressive disorder, posttraumatic stress disorder, schizophrenia, substance abuse, and suicide. Readability analyses were performed using the Gunning Fog Index, the Flesch-Kincaid Grade Level, the Coleman-Liau Index, the SMOG Readability Formula, and the Automated Readability Index. These scores were then combined into a Readability Consensus score. A two-tailed t-test was used to compare the mean values, and statistical significance was set at P†<†0.05.<h4>Results</h4>Twelve of the best hospitals for psychiatry 2016-2017 were identified. Nine had educational material. Six of the nine cited the same resource, The StayWell Company, LLC (StayWell Company, LLC; Yardley, PA), for at least one of the mental health topics analyzed. The VA mental health website (http://www.mentalhealth.va.gov) had a significantly higher readability consensus than six of the top psychiatric hospitals (P†<†0.05, P†=†0.0067, P†=†0.019, P†=†0.041, P†=†0.0093, P†=†0.0054, and P†=†0.0093). The overall average readability consensus for mental health information on all websites analyzed was 9.52.<h4>Conclusions</h4>Online resources for mental health disorders are more complex than recommended by the NIH and AMA. Efforts to improve readability of mental health and psychosocial wellness resources could benefit patient understanding and outcomes, especially in patients with lower literacy. Surgical outcomes are correlated with patient mental health and psychosocial wellness and thus can be improved with more appropriate levels of readability of psychosocial wellness resources.",0,
23023983,Adding unaligned sequences into an existing alignment using MAFFT and LAST.,"<h4>Unlabelled</h4>Two methods to add unaligned sequences into an existing multiple sequence alignment have been implemented as the '--add' and '--addfragments' options in the MAFFT package. The former option is a basic one and applicable only to full-length sequences, whereas the latter option is applicable even when the unaligned sequences are short and fragmentary. These methods internally infer the phylogenetic relationship among the sequences in the existing alignment and the phylogenetic positions of unaligned sequences. Benchmarks based on two independent simulations consistently suggest that the ""--addfragments"" option outperforms recent methods, PaPaRa and PAGAN, in accuracy for difficult problems and that these three methods appropriately handle easy problems.<h4>Availability</h4>http://mafft.cbrc.jp/alignment/software/<h4>Contact</h4>katoh@ifrec.osaka-u.ac.jp<h4>Supplementary information</h4>Supplementary data are available at Bioinformatics online.",0,
24023630,PhagoSight: an open-source MATLAB¬Æ package for the analysis of fluorescent neutrophil and macrophage migration in a zebrafish model.,"Neutrophil migration in zebrafish larvae is increasingly used as a model to study the response of these leukocytes to different determinants of the cellular inflammatory response. However, it remains challenging to extract comprehensive information describing the behaviour of neutrophils from the multi-dimensional data sets acquired with widefield or confocal microscopes. Here, we describe PhagoSight, an open-source software package for the segmentation, tracking and visualisation of migrating phagocytes in three dimensions. The algorithms in PhagoSight extract a large number of measurements that summarise the behaviour of neutrophils, but that could potentially be applied to any moving fluorescent cells. To derive a useful panel of variables quantifying aspects of neutrophil migratory behaviour, and to demonstrate the utility of PhagoSight, we evaluated changes in the volume of migrating neutrophils. Cell volume increased as neutrophils migrated towards the wound region of injured zebrafish. PhagoSight is openly available as MATLABÆ m-files under the GNU General Public License. Synthetic data sets and a comprehensive user manual are available from http://www.phagosight.org.",0,
30714121,The histidine decarboxylase model of tic pathophysiology: a new focus on the histamine H<sub>3</sub> receptor.,"Histamine dysregulation was implicated as a rare cause of Tourette syndrome and other tic disorders a decade ago by a landmark genetic study in a high density family pedigree, which implicated a hypomorphic mutation in the histidine decarboxylase (Hdc) gene as a rare but high penetrance genetic cause. Studies in Hdc knockout (KO) mice have confirmed that this mutation causes tic-relevant behavioural and neurochemical abnormalities that parallel what is seen in patients and thus validate the KO as a potentially informative model of tic pathophysiology. Recent studies have focused on the potential role of the histamine H<sub>3</sub> receptor in this model, and by association in tic disorders and related neuropsychiatric conditions. The H<sub>3</sub> receptor is up-regulated in the striatum in Hdc KO mice. As the H<sub>3</sub> receptor has constitutive activity in the absence of ligand, this receptor up-regulation may have significant cellular effects despite the absence of neurotransmitter histamine in these mice. Activation in vivo of H<sub>3</sub> receptors in wild type mice regulates signalling in striatal medium spiny neurons (MSNs) that interacts non-linearly with dopamine receptor signalling. Baseline signalling alterations in MSNs in Hdc KO mice resemble those seen after H<sub>3</sub> receptor agonist treatment in wild type animals. H<sub>3</sub> receptor agonist treatment in the KOs further accentuates most of these signalling abnormalities and produces behavioural stereotypy. Together, these data suggest the intriguing hypothesis that constitutive signalling by up-regulated H<sub>3</sub> receptors explains many of the molecular and behavioural abnormalities seen in these animals.

30918038,Relationship between sociodemographic factors and specialty destination of UK trainee doctors: a national cohort study.,"OBJECTIVES:Many countries are driving forward policies to widen the socioeconomic profile of medical students and to train more medical students for certain specialties. However, little is known about how socioeconomic origin relates to specialty choice. Nor is there a good understanding of the relationship between academic performance and specialty choice. To address these gaps, our aim was to identify the relationship between socioeconomic background, academic performance and accepted offers into specialty training. DESIGN:Longitudinal, cohort study using data from the UK Medical Education Database (https://www.ukmed.ac.uk/). PARTICIPANTS:6065 (60% females) UK doctors who accepted offers to a specialty training (residency) post after completing the 2-year generic foundation programme (UK Foundation Programme) between 2012 and 2014. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES:<U+03A7>2 tests were used to examine the relationships between sociodemographic characteristics, academic ability and the dependent variable, specialty choice. Multiple data imputation was used to address the issue of missing data. Multinomial regression was employed to test the independent variables in predicting the likelihood of choosing a given specialty. RESULTS:Participants pursuing careers in more competitive specialties had significantly higher academic scores than colleagues pursuing less competitive ones. After controlling for the presence of multiple factors, trainees who came from families where no parent was educated to a degree level had statistically significant lower odds of choosing careers in medical specialties relative to general practice (OR=0.78, 95% CI, 0.67 to 0.92). Students who entered medical school as school leavers, compared with mature students, had odds 1.2 times higher (95% CI, 1.04 to 1.56) of choosing surgical specialties than general practice. CONCLUSIONS:The data indicate a direct association between trainees' sociodemographic characteristics, academic ability and career choices. The findings can be used by medical school, training boards and workforce planners to inform recruitment and retention strategies.",0,
32419835,Integrated Analysis of the Mechanisms of Da-Chai-Hu Decoction in Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus by a Network Pharmacology Approach.,"Background:The incidence of type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) has increased year by year, which not only seriously affects people's quality of life, but also imposes a heavy economic burden on the family, society, and country. Currently, the pathogenesis, diagnosis, and treatment of T2DM are still unclear. Therefore, exploration of a precise multitarget treatment strategy is urgent. Here, we attempt to screen out the active components, effective targets, and functional pathways of therapeutic drugs through network pharmacology with taking advantages of traditional Chinese medicine (TCM) formulas for multitarget holistic treatment of diseases to clarify the potential therapeutic mechanism of TCM formulas and provide a systematic and clear thought for T2DM treatment. Methods:First, we screened the active components of Da-Chai-Hu Decoction (DCHD) by absorption, distribution, metabolism, excretion, and toxicity (ADME/T) calculation. Second, we predicted and screened the active components of DCHD and its therapeutic targets for T2DM relying on the Traditional Chinese Medicine Systems Pharmacology Analysis Platform (TCMSP database) and Text Mining Tool (GoPubMed database), while using the Database for Annotation, Visualization, and Integrated Discovery (DAVID) to obtain T2DM targets. Third, we constructed a network of the active component-target, target-pathway of DCHD using Cytoscape software (http://cytoscape.org/,ver.3.5.1) and then analyzed gene function, related biological processes, and signal pathways through the DAVID database. Results:We screened 77 active components from 1278 DCHD components and 116 effective targets from 253 ones. After matching the targets of T2DM, we obtained 38 important targets and 7 core targets were selected through further analysis. Through enrichment analysis, we found that these important targets were mainly involved in many biological processes such as oxidative stress, inflammatory reaction, and apoptosis. After analyzing the relevant pathways, the synthetic pathway for the treatment of T2DM was obtained, which provided a diagnosis-treatment idea for DCHD in the treatment of T2DM. Conclusions:This article reveals the mechanism of DCHD in the treatment of T2DM related to inflammatory response and apoptosis through network pharmacology, which lays a foundation for further elucidation of drugs effective targets.",0,

32297095,Using Complier Average Causal Effect Estimation to Examine Student Outcomes of the PAX Good Behavior Game When Integrated with the PATHS Curriculum.,"A growing body of research has documented a link between variation in implementation dosage and outcomes associated with preventive interventions. Complier Average Causal Effect (CACE; Jo in J Educ Behav Stat 27:385-409, 2002) analysis allows for estimating program impacts in light of variation in implementation. This study reports intent-to-treat (ITT) and CACE findings from a randomized controlled trial (RCT) testing the impacts of the universal PAX Good Behavior Game (PAX GBG)†integrated with Promoting Alternative Thinking Strategies (i.e., PATHS to PAX) and PAX GBG only compared to a control. This study used ratings by 318†K-5 teachers of 1526 at-risk children who, at baseline, were rated as displaying the top 33rd percentile of aggressive-disruptive behavior. Leveraging a prior study on these data (Berg et al. in Admin Policy Ment Health Ment Health Serv Res 44:558-571, https://doi.org/10.1007/s10488-016-0738-1 , 2017), CACE was defined as the effect of intervention assignment for compliers, using two compliance cut points (50th and 75th percentile), on posttest ratings of student academic engagement, social competence, peer relations, emotion regulation, hyperactivity, and aggressive-disruptive behavior. The ITT analyses indicated improvements for students in the integrated condition on ratings of social competence compared to the control condition. The CACE analyses also indicated significant effects of the integrated intervention on social competence, as well as academic engagement and emotion regulation for students in high compliance classrooms. These findings illustrate the importance of considering variation in implementation within the context of RCTs.",0,

Inaccurate and delayed diagnoses increase the risk, especially in developing countries. Studies have indicated the significant roles of genetic elements in ILDs pathogenesis. Therefore, the first genetic knowledge resource, ILDgenDB, has been developed with an objective to provide ILDs genetic data and their integrated analyses for the better understanding of disease pathogenesis and identification of diagnostics-based biomarkers. This resource contains literature-curated disease candidate genes (DCGs) enriched with various regulatory elements that have been generated using an integrated bioinformatics workflow of databases searches, literature-mining and DCGs-microRNA (miRNAs)-single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) association analyses. To provide statistical significance to disease-gene association, ILD-specificity index and hypergeomatric test scores were also incorporated. Association analyses of miRNAs, SNPs and pathways responsible for the pathogenesis of different sub-classes of ILDs were also incorporated. Manually verified 299 DCGs and their significant associations with 1932 SNPs, 2966 miRNAs and 9170 miR-polymorphisms were also provided. Furthermore, 216 literature-mined and proposed biomarkers were identified. The ILDgenDB resource provides user-friendly browsing and extensive query-based information retrieval systems. Additionally, this resource also facilitates graphical view of predicted DCGs-SNPs/miRNAs and literature associated DCGs-ILDs interactions for each ILD to facilitate efficient data interpretation. Outcomes of analyses suggested the significant involvement of immune system and defense mechanisms in ILDs pathogenesis. This resource may potentially facilitate genetic-based disease monitoring and diagnosis.Database URL: http://14.139.240.55/ildgendb/index.php.",1,
25098325,MediaDB: a database of microbial growth conditions in defined media.,"Isolating pure microbial cultures and cultivating them in the laboratory on defined media is used to more fully characterize the metabolism and physiology of organisms. However, identifying an appropriate growth medium for a novel isolate remains a challenging task. Even organisms with sequenced and annotated genomes can be difficult to grow, despite our ability to build genome-scale metabolic networks that connect genomic data with metabolic function. The scientific literature is scattered with information about defined growth media used successfully for cultivating a wide variety of organisms, but to date there exists no centralized repository to inform efforts to cultivate less characterized organisms by bridging the gap between genomic data and compound composition for growth media. Here we present MediaDB, a manually curated database of defined media that have been used for cultivating organisms with sequenced genomes, with an emphasis on organisms with metabolic network models. The database is accessible online, can be queried by keyword searches or downloaded in its entirety, and can generate exportable individual media formulation files. The data assembled in MediaDB facilitate comparative studies of organism growth media, serve as a starting point for formulating novel growth media, and contribute to formulating media for in silico investigation of metabolic networks.

Walkable neighborhoods have been associated with physical activity, but more rigorous analytical approaches are needed.<h4>Objectives</h4>We used longitudinal data from adult residents of Brisbane, Australia (40-65 years of age at baseline) to estimate effects of changes in neighborhood characteristics over a 6-y period on the likelihood of walking for transport.<h4>Methods</h4>Analyses included 2,789-9,747 How Areas Influence Health and Activity (HABITAT) cohort participants from 200 neighborhoods at baseline (2007) who completed up to three follow-up questionnaires (through 2013). Principal components analysis was used to derive a proxy measure of walkability preference. Environmental predictors were changes in street connectivity, residential density, and land use mix within a one-kilometer network buffer. Associations with any walking and minutes of walking were estimated using logistic and linear regression, including random effects models adjusted for time-varying confounders and a measure of walkability preference, and fixed effects models of changes in individuals to eliminate confounding by time-invariant characteristics.<h4>Results</h4>Any walking for transport (vs. none) was increased in association with an increase in street connectivity (+10 intersections, fixed effects OR=1.19; 95% confidence interval (CI): 1.07, 1.32), residential density (+5 dwellings/hectare, OR=1.10; 95% CI: 1.05, 1.15), and land-use mix (10% increase, OR=1.12; 95% CI: 1.00, 1.26). Associations with minutes of walking were positive based on random effects models, but null for fixed effects models. The association between land-use mix and any walking appeared to be limited to participants in the highest tertile of increased street connectivity (fixed effects OR=1.17; 95% CI: 0.99, 1.35 for a 1-unit increase in land-use mix; interaction <i>p</i>-value=0.05).<h4>Conclusions</h4>Increases in street connectivity, residential density, and land-use heterogeneity were associated with walking for transport among middle-age residents of Brisbane, Australia. https://doi.org/10.1289/EHP2080.",0,
28783153,PECAN: library-free peptide detection for data-independent acquisition tandem mass spectrometry data.,"Data-independent acquisition (DIA) is an emerging mass spectrometry (MS)-based technique for unbiased and reproducible measurement of protein mixtures. DIA tandem mass spectrometry spectra are often highly multiplexed, containing product ions from multiple cofragmenting precursors. Detecting peptides directly from DIA data is therefore challenging; most DIA data analyses require spectral libraries. Here we present PECAN (http://pecan.maccosslab.org), a library-free, peptide-centric tool that robustly and accurately detects peptides directly from DIA data. PECAN reports evidence of detection based on product ion scoring, which enables detection of low-abundance analytes with poor precursor ion signal.

Lastly, we used PECAN to build a plasma proteome library from DIA data and to query known sequence variants.",0,
29036270,On expert curation and scalability: UniProtKB/Swiss-Prot as a case study.,"Motivation:Biological knowledgebases, such as UniProtKB/Swiss-Prot, constitute an essential component of daily scientific research by offering distilled, summarized and computable knowledge extracted from the literature by expert curators. While knowledgebases play an increasingly important role in the scientific community, their ability to keep up with the growth of biomedical literature is under scrutiny. Using UniProtKB/Swiss-Prot as a case study, we address this concern via multiple literature triage approaches. Results:With the assistance of the PubTator text-mining tool, we tagged more than 10 000 articles to assess the ratio of papers relevant for curation. We first show that curators read and evaluate many more papers than they curate, and that measuring the number of curated publications is insufficient to provide a complete picture as demonstrated by the fact that 8000-10 000 papers are curated in UniProt each year while curators evaluate 50 000-70 000 papers per year. We show that 90% of the papers in PubMed are out of the scope of UniProt, that a maximum of 2-3% of the papers indexed in PubMed each year are relevant for UniProt curation, and that, despite appearances, expert curation in UniProt is scalable.

21994220,FlyExpress: visual mining of spatiotemporal patterns for genes and publications in Drosophila embryogenesis.,"<h4>Summary</h4>Images containing spatial expression patterns illuminate the roles of different genes during embryogenesis. In order to generate initial clues to regulatory interactions, biologists frequently need to know the set of genes expressed at the same time at specific locations in a developing embryo, as well as related research publications. However, text-based mining of image annotations and research articles cannot produce all relevant results, because the primary data are images that exist as graphical objects. We have developed a unique knowledge base (FlyExpress) to facilitate visual mining of images from Drosophila melanogaster embryogenesis. By clicking on specific locations in pictures of fly embryos from different stages of development and different visual projections, users can produce a list of genes and publications instantly. In FlyExpress, each queryable embryo picture is a heat-map that captures the expression patterns of more than 4500 genes and more than 2600 published articles. In addition, one can view spatial patterns for particular genes over time as well as find other genes with similar expression patterns at a given developmental stage. Therefore, FlyExpress is a unique tool for mining spatiotemporal expression patterns in a format readily accessible to the scientific community.<h4>Availability</h4>http://www.flyexpress.net<h4>Contact</h4>s.kumar@asu.edu.",1,

Genome high-throughput technologies produce a huge amount of information pertaining gene expression and regulation; however, the complexity of the available data is often overwhelming and tools are needed to extract and organize the relevant information. This work starts from the assumption that the observation of co-occurrent events (in particular co-localization, co-expression and co-regulation) may provide a powerful starting point to begin unravelling transcriptional regulatory networks. Co-expressed genes often imply shared functional pathways; co-expressed and functionally related genes are often co-localized, too; moreover, co-expressed and co-localized genes are also potential targets for co-regulation; finally, co-regulation seems more frequent for genes mapped to proximal chromosome regions. Despite the recognized importance of analysing co-occurrent events, no bioinformatics solution allowing the simultaneous analysis of co-expression, co-localization and co-regulation is currently available. Our work resulted in developing and valuating CluGene, a software providing tools to analyze multiple types of co-occurrences within a single interactive environment allowing the interactive investigation of combined co-expression, co-localization and co-regulation of genes. The use of CluGene will enhance the power of testing hypothesis and experimental approaches aimed at unravelling transcriptional regulatory networks.

28472263,A deep learning framework for improving long-range residue-residue contact prediction using a hierarchical strategy.,"<h4>Motivation</h4>Residue-residue contacts are of great value for protein structure prediction, since contact information, especially from those long-range residue pairs, can significantly reduce the complexity of conformational sampling for protein structure prediction in practice. Despite progresses in the past decade on protein targets with abundant homologous sequences, accurate contact prediction for proteins with limited sequence information is still far from satisfaction. Methodologies for these hard targets still need further improvement.<h4>Results</h4>We presented a computational program DeepConPred, which includes a pipeline of two novel deep-learning-based methods (DeepCCon and DeepRCon) as well as a contact refinement step, to improve the prediction of long-range residue contacts from primary sequences. When compared with previous prediction approaches, our framework employed an effective scheme to identify optimal and important features for contact prediction, and was only trained with coevolutionary information derived from a limited number of homologous sequences to ensure robustness and usefulness for hard targets. Independent tests showed that 59.33%/49.97%, 64.39%/54.01% and 70.00%/59.81% of the top L/5, top L/10 and top 5 predictions were correct for CASP10/CASP11 proteins, respectively. In general, our algorithm ranked as one of the best methods for CASP targets.<h4>Availability and implementation</h4>All source data and codes are available at http://166.111.152.91/Downloads.html .<h4>Contact</h4>hgong@tsinghua.edu.cn or zengjy321@tsinghua.edu.cn.<h4>Supplementary information</h4>Supplementary data are available at Bioinformatics online.",0,
32219412,Circad: a comprehensive manually curated resource of circular RNA associated with diseases.,"Circular RNAs (circRNAs) are unique transcript isoforms characterized by back splicing of exon ends to form a covalently closed loop or circular conformation. These transcript isoforms are now known to be expressed in a variety of organisms across the kingdoms of life. Recent studies have shown the role of circRNAs in a number of diseases and increasing evidence points to their potential application as biomarkers in these diseases. We have created a comprehensive manually curated database of circular RNAs associated with diseases. This database is available at URL http://clingen.igib.res.in/circad/. The Database lists more than 1300 circRNAs associated with 150 diseases and mapping to 113 International Statistical Classification of Diseases (ICD) codes with evidence of association linked to published literature. The database is unique in many ways. Firstly, it provides ready-to-use primers to work with, in order to use circRNAs as biomarkers or to perform functional studies. It additionally lists the assay and PCR primer details including experimentally validated ones as a ready reference to researchers along with fold change and statistical significance. It also provides standard disease nomenclature as per the ICD codes. To the best of our knowledge, circad is the most comprehensive and updated database of disease associated circular RNAs.Availability: http://clingen.igib.res.in/circad/.",1,
25150030,Is the Alma Ata vision of comprehensive primary health care viable? Findings from an international project.,"<h4>Background</h4>The 4-year (2007-2011) Revitalizing Health for All international research program (http://www.globalhealthequity.ca/projects/proj_revitalizing/index.shtml) supported 20 research teams located in 15 low- and middle-income countries to explore the strengths and weaknesses of comprehensive primary health care (CPHC) initiatives at their local or national levels. Teams were organized in a triad comprised of a senior researcher, a new researcher, and a 'research user' from government, health services, or other organizations with the authority or capacity to apply the research findings. Multiple regional and global team capacity-enhancement meetings were organized to refine methods and to discuss and assess cross-case findings.<h4>Objective</h4>Most research projects used mixed methods, incorporating analyses of qualitative data (interviews and focus groups), secondary data, and key policy and program documents. Some incorporated historical case study analyses, and a few undertook new surveys. The synthesis of findings in this report was derived through qualitative analysis of final project reports undertaken by three different reviewers.<h4>Results</h4>Evidence of comprehensiveness (defined in this research program as efforts to improve equity in access, community empowerment and participation, social and environmental health determinants, and intersectoral action) was found in many of the cases.<h4>Conclusions</h4>Despite the important contextual differences amongst the different country studies, the similarity of many of their findings, often generated using mixed methods, attests to certain transferable health systems characteristics to create and sustain CPHC practices. These include:1. Well-trained and supported community health workers (CHWs) able to work effectively with marginalized communities2. Effective mechanisms for community participation, both informal (through participation in projects and programs, and meaningful consultation) and formal (though program management structures)3. Co-partnership models in program and policy development (in which financial and knowledge supports from governments or institutions are provided to communities, which retain decision-making powers in program design and implementation)4. Support for community advocacy and engagement in health and social systems decision makingThese characteristics, in turn, require a political context that supports state responsibilities for redistributive health and social protection measures.",0,
32611389,Proteus: An algorithm for proposing stabilizing mutation pairs based on interactions observed in known protein 3D structures.,"BACKGROUND:Protein engineering has many applications for industry, such as the development of new drugs, vaccines, treatment therapies, food, and biofuel production. A common way to engineer a protein is to perform mutations in functionally essential residues to optimize their function. However, the discovery of beneficial mutations for proteins is a complex task, with a time-consuming and high cost for experimental validation. Hence, computational approaches have been used to propose new insights for experiments narrowing the search space and reducing the costs. RESULTS:In this study, we developed Proteus (an acronym for Protein Engineering Supporter), a new algorithm for proposing mutation pairs in a target 3D structure. These suggestions are based on contacts observed in other known structures from Protein Data Bank (PDB). Proteus' basic assumption is that if a non-interacting pair of amino acid residues in the target structure is exchanged to an interacting pair, this could enhance protein stability. This trade is only allowed if the main-chain conformation of the residues involved in the contact is conserved. Furthermore, no steric impediment is expected between the proposed mutations and the surrounding protein atoms. To evaluate Proteus, we performed two case studies with proteins of industrial interests. In the first case study, we evaluated if the mutations suggested by Proteus for four protein structures enhance the number of inter-residue contacts. Our results suggest that most mutations proposed by Proteus increase the number of interactions into the protein. In the second case study, we used Proteus to suggest mutations for a lysozyme protein. Then, we compared Proteus' outcomes to mutations with available experimental evidence reported in the ProTherm database. Four mutations, in which our results agree with the experimental data, were found. This could be initial evidence that changes in the side-chain of some residues do not cause disturbances that harm protein structure stability. CONCLUSION:We believe that Proteus could be used combined with other methods to give new insights into the rational development of engineered proteins.

28827280,Systematic and Quantitative Assessment of Hydrogen Peroxide Reactivity With Cysteines Across Human Proteomes.,"Protein cysteinyl residues are the mediators of hydrogen peroxide (H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>)-dependent redox signaling. However, site-specific mapping of the selectivity and dynamics of these redox reactions in cells poses a major analytical challenge. Here we describe a chemoproteomic platform to systematically and quantitatively analyze the reactivity of thousands of cysteines toward H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> in human cells. We identified >900 H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>-sensitive cysteines, which are defined as the H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>-dependent redoxome. Although redox sites associated with antioxidative and metabolic functions are consistent, most of the H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>-dependent redoxome varies dramatically between different cells. Structural analyses reveal that H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>-sensitive cysteines are less conserved than their redox-insensitive counterparts and display distinct sequence motifs, structural features, and potential for crosstalk with lysine modifications. Notably, our chemoproteomic platform also provides an opportunity to predict oxidation-triggered protein conformational changes.

27307636,DFLpred: High-throughput prediction of disordered flexible linker regions in protein sequences.,"<h4>Motivation</h4>Disordered flexible linkers (DFLs) are disordered regions that serve as flexible linkers/spacers in multi-domain proteins or between structured constituents in domains. They are different from flexible linkers/residues because they are disordered and longer. Availability of experimentally annotated DFLs provides an opportunity to build high-throughput computational predictors of these regions from protein sequences. To date, there are no computational methods that directly predict DFLs and they can be found only indirectly by filtering predicted flexible residues with predictions of disorder.<h4>Results</h4>We conceptualized, developed and empirically assessed a first-of-its-kind sequence-based predictor of DFLs, DFLpred. This method outputs propensity to form DFLs for each residue in the input sequence. DFLpred uses a small set of empirically selected features that quantify propensities to form certain secondary structures, disordered regions and structured regions, which are processed by a fast linear model. Our high-throughput predictor can be used on the whole-proteome scale; it needs <1 h to predict entire proteome on a single CPU. When assessed on an independent test dataset with low sequence-identity proteins, it secures area under the receiver operating characteristic curve equal 0.715 and outperforms existing alternatives that include methods for the prediction of flexible linkers, flexible residues, intrinsically disordered residues and various combinations of these methods. Prediction on the complete human proteome reveals that about 10% of proteins have a large content of over 30% DFL residues. We also estimate that about 6000 DFL regions are long with =30 consecutive residues.<h4>Availability and implementation</h4>http://biomine.ece.ualberta.ca/DFLpred/<h4>Contact</h4>lkurgan@vcu.edu<h4>Supplementary information</h4>Supplementary data are available at Bioinformatics online.",0,
24273012,SpliceProt: a protein sequence repository of predicted human splice variants.,"The mechanism of alternative splicing in the transcriptome may increase the proteome diversity in eukaryotes. In proteomics, several studies aim to use protein sequence repositories to annotate MS experiments or to detect differentially expressed proteins. However, the available protein sequence repositories are not designed to fully detect protein isoforms derived from mRNA splice variants. To foster knowledge for the field, here we introduce SpliceProt, a new protein sequence repository of transcriptome experimental data used to investigate for putative splice variants in human proteomes. Current version of SpliceProt contains 159†719 non-redundant putative polypeptide sequences. The assessment of the potential of SpliceProt in detecting new protein isoforms resulting from alternative splicing was performed by using publicly available proteomics data. We detected 173 peptides hypothetically derived from splice variants, which 54 of them are not present in UniprotKB/TrEMBL sequence repository. In comparison to other protein sequence repositories, SpliceProt contains a greater number of unique peptides and is able to detect more splice variants. Therefore, SpliceProt provides a solution for the annotation of proteomics experiments regarding splice isofoms. The repository files containing the translated sequences of the predicted splice variants and a visualization tool are freely available at http://lbbc.inca.gov.br/spliceprot.",1,
22369658,DetoxiProt: an integrated database for detoxification proteins.,"<h4>Background</h4>Detoxification proteins are a class of proteins for degradation and/or elimination of endogenous and exogenous toxins or medicines, as well as reactive oxygen species (ROS) produced by these materials. Most of these proteins are generated as a response to the stimulation of toxins or medicines. They are essential for the clearance of harmful substances and for maintenance of physiological balance in organisms. Thus, it is important to collect and integrate information on detoxification proteins.<h4>Results</h4>To store, retrieve and analyze the information related to their features and functions, we developed the DetoxiProt, a comprehensive database for annotation of these proteins. This database provides detailed introductions about different classes of the detoxification proteins. Extensive annotations of these proteins, including sequences, structures, features, inducers, inhibitors, substrates, chromosomal location, functional domains as well as physiological-biochemical properties were generated. Furthermore, pre-computed BLAST results, multiple sequence alignments and evolutionary trees for detoxification proteins are also provided for evolutionary study of conserved function and pathways. The current version of DetoxiProt contains 5956 protein entries distributed in 628 organisms. An easy to use web interface was designed, so that annotations about each detoxification protein can be retrieved by browsing with a specific method or by searching with different criteria.<h4>Conclusions</h4>DetoxiProt provides an effective and efficient way of accessing the detoxification protein sequences and other high-quality information. This database would be a valuable source for toxicologists, pharmacologists and medicinal chemists. DetoxiProt database is freely available at http://lifecenter.sgst.cn/detoxiprot/.",1,
27397138,Dynamic Bayesian Network for Accurate Detection of Peptides from Tandem Mass Spectra.,"A central problem in mass spectrometry analysis involves identifying, for each observed tandem mass spectrum, the corresponding generating peptide. We present a dynamic Bayesian network (DBN) toolkit that addresses this problem by using a machine learning approach. At the heart of this toolkit is a DBN for Rapid Identification (DRIP), which can be trained from collections of high-confidence peptide-spectrum matches (PSMs). DRIP's score function considers fragment ion matches using Gaussians rather than fixed fragment-ion tolerances and also finds the optimal alignment between the theoretical and observed spectrum by considering all possible alignments, up to a threshold that is controlled using a beam-pruning algorithm. This function not only yields state-of-the art database search accuracy but also can be used to generate features that significantly boost the performance of the Percolator postprocessor. The DRIP software is built upon a general purpose DBN toolkit (GMTK), thereby allowing a wide variety of options for user-specific inference tasks as well as facilitating easy modifications to the DRIP model in future work. DRIP is implemented in Python and C++ and is available under Apache license at http://melodi-lab.github.io/dripToolkit .",0,

IND601142821,MulSatDB: a first online database for mulberry microsatellites,"KEY MESSAGE : Simple sequence repeat motifs were mined from the genome and EST sequences of Morus notabilis and archived in MulSatDB. Bioinformatics tools were integrated with the database for the analysis of genomic datasets. Mulberry is a crop of economic importance in sericulture, which shapes the lives of millions of rural people among different Eurasian and Latin American countries. Limited availability of genomic resources has constrained the molecular breeding efforts in mulberry, a poorly studied crop. Microsatellite or simple sequence repeat (SSR) has revolutionized the plant breeding and is used in linkage mapping, association studies, diversity, and parentage analysis, etc. Recent availability of mulberry whole genome assembly provided an opportunity for the development of mulberry-specific DNA markers. In this study, we mined a total of 217,312 microsatellites from whole genome and 961 microsatellites from EST sequences of Morus notabilis. Mono-repeats were predominant among both whole genome and EST sequences. The SSR containing EST sequences were functionally annotated, and SSRs mined from whole genome were mapped on chromosomes of the phylogenetically related genusóFragaria vesca, to aid the selection of markers based on the function and location. All the mined markers were archived in the mulberry microsatellite database (MulSatDB), and the markers can be retrieved based on different criteria like marker location, repeat kind, motif type and size. Primer3plus and CMap tools are integrated with the database to design primers for PCR amplification and to visualize markers on F. vesca chromosomes, respectively. A blast tool is also integrated to collate new markers with the database.

23192052,Hierarchical shrinkage priors and model fitting for high-dimensional generalized linear models.,"Abstract     Genetic and other scientific studies routinely generate very many predictor variables, which can be naturally grouped, with predictors in the same groups being highly correlated. It is desirable to incorporate the hierarchical structure of the predictor variables into generalized linear models for simultaneous variable selection and coefficient estimation. We propose two prior distributions: hierarchical Cauchy and double-exponential distributions, on coefficients in generalized linear models. The hierarchical priors include both variable-specific and group-specific tuning parameters, thereby not only adopting different shrinkage for different coefficients and different groups but also providing a way to pool the information within groups. We fit generalized linear models with the proposed hierarchical priors by incorporating flexible expectation-maximization (EM) algorithms into the standard iteratively weighted least squares as implemented in the general statistical package R. The methods are illustrated with data from an experiment to identify genetic polymorphisms for survival of mice following infection with Listeria monocytogenes. The performance of the proposed procedures is further assessed via simulation studies. The methods are implemented in a freely available R package BhGLM (http://www.ssg.uab.edu/bhglm/).",0,

31150060,Augmented Interval List: a novel data structure for efficient genomic interval search.,"<h4>Motivation</h4>Genomic data is frequently stored as segments or intervals. Because this data type is so common, interval-based comparisons are fundamental to genomic analysis. As the volume of available genomic data grows, developing efficient and scalable methods for searching interval data is necessary.<h4>Results</h4>We present a new data structure, the Augmented Interval List (AIList), to enumerate intersections between a query interval q and an interval set R. An AIList is constructed by first sorting R as a list by the interval start coordinate, then decomposing it into a few approximately flattened components (sublists), and then augmenting each sublist with the running maximum interval end. The query time for AIList is O(log2N+n+m), where n is the number of overlaps between R and q, N is the number of intervals in the set R and m is the average number of extra comparisons required to find the n overlaps. Tested on real genomic interval datasets, AIList code runs 5-18 times faster than standard high-performance code based on augmented interval-trees, nested containment lists or R-trees (BEDTools). For large datasets, the memory-usage for AIList is 4-60% of other methods. The AIList data structure, therefore, provides a significantly improved fundamental operation for highly scalable genomic data analysis.<h4>Availability and implementation</h4>An implementation of the AIList data structure with both construction and search algorithms is available at http://ailist.databio.org.<h4>Supplementary information</h4>Supplementary data are available at Bioinformatics online.",0,

24108511,Antibiotics for the prophylaxis of bacterial endocarditis in dentistry.,"<h4>Background</h4>Infective endocarditis is a severe infection arising in the lining of the chambers of the heart with a high mortality rate.Many dental procedures cause bacteraemia and it was believed that this may lead to bacterial endocarditis (BE) in a few people. Guidelines in many countries have recommended that prior to invasive dental procedures antibiotics are administered to people at high risk of endocarditis. However, recent guidance by the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) in England and Wales has recommended that antibiotics are not required.<h4>Objectives</h4>To determine whether prophylactic antibiotic administration, compared to no such administration or placebo, before invasive dental procedures in people at risk or at high risk of bacterial endocarditis influences mortality, serious illness or the incidence of endocarditis.<h4>Search methods</h4>The following electronic databases were searched: the Cochrane Oral Health Group's Trials Register (to 21 January 2013), the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) (The Cochrane Library 2012, Issue 12), MEDLINE via OVID (1946 to 21 January 2013) and EMBASE via OVID (1980 to 21 January 2013). We searched for ongoing trials in the US National Institutes of Health Trials Register (http://clinicaltrials.gov) and the metaRegister of Controlled Trials (http://www.controlled-trials.com/mrct/). No restrictions were placed on the language or date of publication when searching the electronic databases.<h4>Selection criteria</h4>Due to the low incidence of BE it was anticipated that few if any trials would be located. For this reason, cohort and case-control studies were included where suitably matched control or comparison groups had been studied. The intervention was the administration of antibiotic, compared to no such administration, before a dental procedure in people with an increased risk of BE. Cohort studies would need to follow those individuals at increased risk and assess outcomes following any invasive dental procedures, grouping by whether prophylaxis was received or not. Included case-control studies would need to match people who had developed endocarditis (and who were known to be at increased risk before undergoing an invasive dental procedure preceding the onset of endocarditis) with those at similar risk but who had not developed endocarditis. Outcomes of interest were mortality or serious adverse events requiring hospital admission; development of endocarditis following any dental procedure in a defined time period; development of endocarditis due to other non-dental causes; any recorded adverse events to the antibiotics; and cost implications of the antibiotic provision for the care of those patients who developed endocarditis.<h4>Data collection and analysis</h4>Two review authors independently selected studies for inclusion then assessed risk of bias and extracted data from the included study.<h4>Main results</h4>No randomised controlled trials (RCTs), controlled clinical trials (CCTs) or cohort studies were included. One case-control study met the inclusion criteria. It collected all the cases of endocarditis in the Netherlands over two years, finding a total of 24 people who developed endocarditis within 180 days of an invasive dental procedure, definitely requiring prophylaxis according to current guidelines, and who were at increased risk of endocarditis due to a pre-existing cardiac problem. This study included participants who died because of the endocarditis (using proxies). Controls attended local cardiology outpatient clinics for similar cardiac problems, had undergone an invasive dental procedure within the past 180 days, and were matched by age with the cases. No significant effect of penicillin prophylaxis on the incidence of endocarditis could be seen. No data were found on other outcomes.<h4>Authors' conclusions</h4>There remains no evidence about whether antibiotic prophylaxis is effective or ineffective against bacterial endocarditis in people at risk who are about to undergo an invasive dental procedure. It is not clear whether the potential harms and costs of antibiotic administration outweigh any beneficial effect. Ethically, practitioners need to discuss the potential benefits and harms of antibiotic prophylaxis with their patients before a decision is made about administration.",0,
22139934,Cube-DB: detection of functional divergence in human protein families.,"Cube-DB is a database of pre-evaluated results for detection of functional divergence in human/vertebrate protein families. The analysis is organized around the nomenclature associated with the human proteins, but based on all currently available vertebrate genomes. Using full genomes enables us, through a mutual-best-hit strategy, to construct comparable taxonomical samples for all paralogues under consideration. Functional specialization is scored on the residue level according to two models of behavior after divergence: heterotachy and homotachy. In the first case, the positions on the protein sequence are scored highly if they are conserved in the reference group of orthologs, and overlap poorly with the residue type choice in the paralogs groups (such positions will also be termed functional determinants). The second model additionally requires conservation within each group of paralogs (functional discriminants). The scoring functions are phylogeny independent, but sensitive to the residue type similarity. The results are presented as a table of per-residue scores, and mapped onto related structure (when available) via browser-embedded visualization tool. They can also be downloaded as a spreadsheet table, and sessions for two additional molecular visualization tools.

33166383,FireProtDB: database of manually curated protein stability data.,"The majority of naturally occurring proteins have evolved to function under mild conditions inside the living organisms. One of the critical obstacles for the use of proteins in biotechnological applications is their insufficient stability at elevated temperatures or in the presence of salts. Since experimental screening for stabilizing mutations is typically laborious and expensive, in silico predictors are often used for narrowing down the mutational landscape. The recent advances in machine learning and artificial intelligence further facilitate the development of such computational tools. However, the accuracy of these predictors strongly depends on the quality and amount of data used for training and testing, which have often been reported as the current bottleneck of the approach. To address this problem, we present a novel database of experimental thermostability data for single-point mutants FireProtDB. The database combines the published datasets, data extracted manually from the recent literature, and the data collected in our laboratory. Its user interface is designed to facilitate both types of the expected use: (i) the interactive explorations of individual entries on the level of a protein or mutation and (ii) the construction of highly customized and machine learning-friendly datasets using advanced searching and filtering.

A stringent examination of the 7848 proteins indicates that close to 89% of the proteins have occurrence of at least a network of 2p or a higher p-p network. The occurrence of p-p networks in various protein superfamilies based on SCOP, CATH and EC classifiers has also been probed in the present work. In general, we find that multidomain and membrane proteins as well as lyases show a more number of these networks. Analysis of the distribution of angle between planes of two proximal aromatic rings (<U+03D5>) distribution indicates that at a larger cutoff distance (between centroid of two aromatic rings), above 5≈, C-H<U+22EF>p interactions (T-shaped orientation) are more prevalent, while p-p interactions (stacked orientation) are more prevalent at a smaller cutoff distance. The connectivity patterns of p-p networks propose strong propensity of finding arrangement of aromatic residues as clusters rather than linear arrangement. We have also made a public domain database ""Aromatic-Aromatic Interactions Database"" (A(2)ID) comprising of all types of p-p networks and their connectivity pattern present in proteins. It can be accessed by url http://203.199.182.73/gnsmmg/databases/aidb/aidb.html.",1,
21786137,Prediction of protein-protein interactions between Ralstonia solanacearum and Arabidopsis                      thaliana.,"Ralstonia solanacearum is a devastating bacterial pathogen that has an unusually wide host range. R. solanacearum, together with Arabidopsis thaliana, has become a model system for studying the molecular basis of plant-pathogen interactions. Protein-protein interactions (PPIs) play a critical role in the infection process, and some PPIs can initiate a plant defense response. However, experimental investigations have rarely addressed such PPIs. Using two computational methods, the interolog and the domain-based methods, we predicted 3,074 potential PPIs between 119 R. solanacearum and 1,442 A. thaliana proteins. Interestingly, we found that the potential pathogen-targeted proteins are more important in the A. thaliana PPI network. To facilitate further studies, all predicted PPI data were compiled into a database server called PPIRA (http://protein.cau.edu.cn/ppira/). We hope that our work will provide new insights for future research addressing the pathogenesis of R. solanacearum.",1,
25643357,Figure-associated text summarization and evaluation.,"Biomedical literature incorporates millions of figures, which are a rich and important knowledge resource for biomedical researchers. Scientists need access to the figures and the knowledge they represent in order to validate research findings and to generate new hypotheses. By themselves, these figures are nearly always incomprehensible to both humans and machines and their associated texts are therefore essential for full comprehension. The associated text of a figure, however, is scattered throughout its full-text article and contains redundant information content. In this paper, we report the continued development and evaluation of several figure summarization systems, the FigSum+ systems, that automatically identify associated texts, remove redundant information, and generate a text summary for every figure in an article. Using a set of 94 annotated figures selected from 19 different journals, we conducted an intrinsic evaluation of FigSum+. We evaluate the performance by precision, recall, F1, and ROUGE scores. The best FigSum+ system is based on an unsupervised method, achieving F1 score of 0.66 and ROUGE-1 score of 0.97. The annotated data is available at figshare.com (http://figshare.com/articles/Figure_Associated_Text_Summarization_and_Evaluation/858903).",0,
25922515,The Fossil Calibration Database-A New Resource for Divergence Dating.,"Fossils provide the principal basis for temporal calibrations, which are critical to the accuracy of divergence dating analyses. Translating fossil data into minimum and maximum bounds for calibrations is the most important-often least appreciated-step of divergence dating. Properly justified calibrations require the synthesis of phylogenetic, paleontological, and geological evidence and can be difficult for nonspecialists to formulate. The dynamic nature of the fossil record (e.g., new discoveries, taxonomic revisions, updates of global or local stratigraphy) requires that calibration data be updated continually lest they become obsolete. Here, we announce the Fossil Calibration Database (http://fossilcalibrations.org), a new open-access resource providing vetted fossil calibrations to the scientific community. Calibrations accessioned into this database are based on individual fossil specimens and follow best practices for phylogenetic justification and geochronological constraint. The associated Fossil Calibration Series, a calibration-themed publication series at Palaeontologia Electronica, will serve as a key pipeline for peer-reviewed calibrations to enter the database.",1,
30662564,Artificial intelligence-based decision-making for age-related macular degeneration.,"Artificial intelligence (AI) based on convolutional neural networks (CNNs) has a great potential to enhance medical workflow and improve health care quality. Of particular interest is practical implementation of such AI-based software as a cloud-based tool aimed for telemedicine, the practice of providing medical care from a distance using electronic interfaces. <b>Methods:</b> In this study, we used a dataset of labeled 35,900 optical coherence tomography (OCT) images obtained from age-related macular degeneration (AMD) patients and used them to train three types of CNNs to perform AMD diagnosis. <b>Results:</b> Here, we present an AI- and cloud-based telemedicine interaction tool for diagnosis and proposed treatment of AMD. Through deep learning process based on the analysis of preprocessed optical coherence tomography (OCT) imaging data, our AI-based system achieved the same image discrimination rate as that of retinal specialists in our hospital. The AI platform's detection accuracy was generally higher than 90% and was significantly superior (p < 0.001) to that of medical students (69.4% and 68.9%) and equal (p = 0.99) to that of retinal specialists (92.73% and 91.90%). Furthermore, it provided appropriate treatment recommendations comparable to those of retinal specialists. <b>Conclusions:</b> We therefore developed a website for realistic cloud computing based on this AI platform, available at https://www.ym.edu.tw/~AI-OCT/. Patients can upload their OCT images to the website to verify whether they have AMD and require treatment. Using an AI-based cloud service represents a real solution for medical imaging diagnostics and telemedicine.",0,
21345871,BiC: a web server for calculating bimodality of coexpression between gene and protein networks.,"<h4>Unlabelled</h4>Bimodal patterns of expression have recently been shown to be useful not only in prioritizing genes that distinguish phenotypes, but also in prioritizing network models that correlate with proteomic evidence. In particular, subgroups of strongly coexpressed gene pairs result in an increased variance of the correlation distribution. This variance, a measure of association between sets of genes (or proteins), can be summarized as the bimodality of coexpression (BiC). We developed an online tool to calculate the BiC for user-defined gene lists and associated mRNA expression data. BiC is a comprehensive application that provides researchers with the ability to analyze both publicly available and user-collected array data.<h4>Availability</h4>The freely available web service and the documentation can be accessed at http://gurkan.case.edu/software.<h4>Contact</h4>gurkan@case.edu.",0,
26322998,CTDB: An Integrated Chickpea Transcriptome Database for Functional and Applied Genomics.,"Chickpea is an important grain legume used as a rich source of protein in human diet. The narrow genetic diversity and limited availability of genomic resources are the major constraints in implementing breeding strategies and biotechnological interventions for genetic enhancement of chickpea. We developed an integrated Chickpea Transcriptome Database (CTDB), which provides the comprehensive web interface for visualization and easy retrieval of transcriptome data in chickpea. The database features many tools for similarity search, functional annotation (putative function, PFAM domain and gene ontology) search and comparative gene expression analysis. The current release of CTDB (v2.0) hosts transcriptome datasets with high quality functional annotation from cultivated (desi and kabuli types) and wild chickpea. A catalog of transcription factor families and their expression profiles in chickpea are available in the database. The gene expression data have been integrated to study the expression profiles of chickpea transcripts in major tissues/organs and various stages of flower development. The utilities, such as similarity search, ortholog identification and comparative gene expression have also been implemented in the database to facilitate comparative genomic studies among different legumes and Arabidopsis. Furthermore, the CTDB represents a resource for the discovery of functional molecular markers (microsatellites and single nucleotide polymorphisms) between different chickpea types. We anticipate that integrated information content of this database will accelerate the functional and applied genomic research for improvement of chickpea.

Eligible participants were continent men with an International Index of Erectile Function-5 (IIEF-5) score of at least 18, scheduled to undergo nerve-sparing RP. Patients were randomized to a PVS group or a control group. Patients in the PVS group were instructed in using a PVS device (FERTI CARE(Æ) vibrator). Stimulation was performed at the frenulum once daily by the patients in their own homes for at least 1 week before surgery. After catheter removal, daily PVS was re-initiated for a period of 6 weeks. Participants were evaluated at 3, 6 and 12 months after surgery with the IIEF-5 questionnaire and questions regarding urinary bother. Patients using up to one pad daily for security reasons only were considered continent. The study was registered at http://clinicaltrials.gov/ (NCT01067261).<h4>Results</h4>Data from 68 patients were available for analyses (30 patients randomized to PVS and 38 patients randomized to the control group). The IIEF-5 score was highest in the PVS group at all time points after surgery with a median score of 18 vs 7.5 in the control group at 12 months (P = 0.09), but the difference only reached borderline significance. At 12 months, 16/30 (53%) patients in the PVS group had reached an IIEF-5 score of at least 18, while this was the case for 12/38 (32%) patients in the control group (P = 0.07). There were no significant differences in the proportions of continent patients between groups at 3, 6 or 12 months. At 12 months 90% of the PVS patients were continent, while 94.7% of the control patients were continent (P = 0.46).<h4>Conclusion</h4>The present study did not document a significant effect of PVS. However, the method proved to be acceptable for most patients and there was a trend towards better erectile function with PVS. More studies are needed to explore this possible effect further.",0,
30979697,Visualizing Patterns in Pediatric and Adult Hospital Care.,"<h4>Objectives</h4>We aimed to design a graphical tool for understanding and effectively communicating the complex differences between pediatric and adult hospital care systems.<h4>Patients and methods</h4>We analyzed the most recent hospital administrative data sets for inpatient admission and emergency department visits from 7 US states (2014: Arkansas, Florida, Kentucky, Maryland, Massachusetts, and New York; 2011: California). Probabilities of care completion (Pcc) were calculated for pediatric (<18 years old) and adult conditions in all acute-care hospitals in each state. Using the Pcc, we constructed interactive heatmap visualizations for direct comparison of pediatric and adult hospital care systems.<h4>Results</h4>On average, across the 7 states, 70.6% of all hospitals had Pcc >0.5 for more than half of all adult conditions, whereas <14.9% of hospitals had Pcc >0.1 for half of pediatric conditions. Visualizations revealed wide variation among states with clearly apparent institutional dependencies and condition-specific gaps (full interactive versions are available at https://goo.gl/5t8vAw).<h4>Conclusions</h4>The functional disparities between pediatric and adult hospital care systems are substantial, and condition-specific differences should be considered in reimbursement strategies, disaster planning, network adequacy determinations, and public health planning.",0,
27980519,<i>ContaMiner</i> and ContaBase: a webserver and database for early identification of unwantedly crystallized protein contaminants.,"Solving the phase problem in protein X-ray crystallography relies heavily on the identity of the crystallized protein, especially when molecular replacement (MR) methods are used. Yet, it is not uncommon that a contaminant crystallizes instead of the protein of interest. Such contaminants may be proteins from the expression host organism, protein fusion tags or proteins added during the purification steps. Many contaminants co-purify easily, crystallize and give good diffraction data. Identification of contaminant crystals may take time, since the presence of the contaminant is unexpected and its identity unknown. A webserver (<i>ContaMiner</i>) and a contaminant database (ContaBase) have been established, to allow fast MR-based screening of crystallographic data against currently 62 known contaminants. The web-based <i>ContaMiner</i> (available at http://strube.cbrc.kaust.edu.sa/contaminer/) currently produces results in 5 min to 4 h. The program is also available in a github repository and can be installed locally. <i>ContaMiner</i> enables screening of novel crystals at synchrotron beamlines, and it would be valuable as a routine safety check for 'crystallization and preliminary X-ray analysis' publications. Thus, in addition to potentially saving X-ray crystallographers much time and effort, <i>ContaMiner</i> might considerably lower the risk of publishing erroneous data.",1,
33402389,Hypoxia-Induced Suppression of Alternative Splicing of MBD2 Promotes Breast Cancer Metastasis via Activation of FZD1.,"Metastasis is responsible for the majority of breast cancer-related deaths, however, the mechanisms underlying metastasis in this disease remain largely elusive. Here we report that under hypoxic conditions, alternative splicing of MBD2 is suppressed, favoring the production of MBD2a, which facilitates breast cancer metastasis. Specifically, MBD2a promoted, whereas its lesser known short form MBD2c suppressed metastasis. Activation of HIF1 under hypoxia facilitated MBD2a production via repression of SRSF2-mediated alternative splicing. As a result, elevated MBD2a outcompeted MBD2c for binding to promoter CpG islands to activate expression of FZD1, thereby promoting epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition and metastasis. Strikingly, clinical data reveal significantly correlated expression of MBD2a and MBD2c with the invasiveness of malignancy, indicating opposing roles for MBD2 splicing variants in regulating human breast cancer metastasis. Collectively, our findings establish a novel link between MBD2 switching and tumor metastasis and provide a promising therapeutic strategy and predictive biomarkers for hypoxia-driven breast cancer metastasis. SIGNIFICANCE: This study defines the opposing roles and clinical relevance of MBD2a and MBD2c, two MBD2 alternative splicing products, in hypoxia-driven breast cancer metastasis.

The exact characterization of such aberrations remains a challenge despite the availability of increasing amount of data, from SNParray to next-generation sequencing. Furthermore, genomic aberrations in cancer are especially difficult to handle because they are, by nature, unique to the patients. However, their recurrence in specific regions of the genome has been shown to reflect their relevance in the development of tumors. GREVE makes use of previously characterized events to identify such regions and focus any further analysis.<h4>Availability</h4>GREVE is available through a web interface and open-source application (http://www.well.ox.ac.uk/GREVE).",0,

25882789,ReMo-SNPs: a new software tool for identification of polymorphisms in regions and motifs genome-wide.,"Studies of complex genetic diseases have revealed many risk factors of small effect, but the combined amount of heritability explained is still low. Genome-wide association studies are often underpowered to identify true effects because of the very large number of parallel tests. There is, therefore, a great need to generate data sets that are enriched for those markers that have an increased a priori chance of being functional, such as markers in genomic regions involved in gene regulation. ReMo-SNPs is a computational program developed to aid researchers in the process of selecting functional SNPs for association analyses in user-specified regions and/or motifs genome-wide. The useful feature of automatic selection of genotyped markers in the user-provided material makes the output data ready to be used in a following association study. In this article we describe the program and its functions. We also validate the program by including an example study on three different transcription factors and results from an association study on two psychiatric phenotypes. The flexibility of the ReMo-SNPs program enables the user to study any region or sequence of interest, without limitation to transcription factor binding regions and motifs. The program is freely available at: http://www.neuro.ki.se/ReMo-SNPs/.",0,
31339576,Transferrin and H-ferritin involvement in brain iron acquisition during postnatal development: impact of sex and genotype.,"Iron delivery to the developing brain is essential for energy and metabolic support needed for processes such as myelination and neuronal development. Iron deficiency, especially in the developing brain, can result in a number of long-term neurological deficits that persist into adulthood. There is considerable debate that excess access to iron during development may result in iron overload in the brain and subsequently predispose individuals to age-related neurodegenerative diseases. There is a significant gap in knowledge regarding how the brain acquires iron during development and how biological variables such as development, genetics, and sex impact brain iron status. In this study, we used a mouse model expressing a mutant form of the iron homeostatic regulator protein HFE, (Hfe H63D), the most common gene variant in Caucasians, to determine impact of the mutation on brain iron uptake. Iron uptake was assessed using <sup>59</sup> Fe bound to either transferrin or H-ferritin as the iron carrier proteins. We demonstrate that at postnatal day 22, mutant mice brains take up greater amounts of iron compared with wildtype. Moreover, we introduce H-ferritin as a key protein in brain iron transport during development and identify a sex and genotype effect demonstrating female mutant mice take up more iron by transferrin, whereas male mutant mice take up more iron from H-ferritin at PND22. Furthermore, we begin to elucidate the mechanism for uptake using immunohistochemistry to profile the regional distribution and temporal expression of transferrin receptor and T-cell immunoglobulin and mucin domain 2, the latter is the receptor for H-ferritin. These data demonstrate that sex and genotype have significant effects on iron uptake and that regional receptor expression may play a large role in the uptake patterns during development.

27076459,Inferring microRNA-disease associations by random walk on a heterogeneous network with multiple data sources.,"Since the discovery of the regulatory function of microRNA (miRNA), increased attention has focused on identifying the relationship between miRNA and disease. It has been suggested that computational method are an efficient way to identify potential disease-related miRNAs for further confirmation using biological experiments. In this paper, we first highlighted three limitations commonly associated with previous computational methods. To resolve these limitations, we established disease similarity subnetwork and miRNA similarity subnetwork by integrating multiple data sources, where the disease similarity is composed of disease semantic similarity and disease functional similarity, and the miRNA similarity is calculated using the miRNA-target gene and miRNA-lncRNA (long non-coding RNA) associations. Then, a heterogeneous network was constructed by connecting the disease similarity subnetwork and the miRNA similarity subnetwork using the known miRNA-disease associations. We extended random walk with restart to predict miRNA-disease associations in the heterogeneous network. The leave-one-out cross-validation achieved an average area under the curve (AUC) of 0:8049 across 341 diseases and 476 miRNAs. For five-fold cross-validation, our method achieved an AUC from 0:7970 to 0:9249 for 15 human diseases. Case studies further demonstrated the feasibility of our method to discover potential miRNA-disease associations. An online service for prediction is freely available at http://ifmda.aliapp.com.",0,
28453624,Inferring Rates and Length-Distributions of Indels Using Approximate Bayesian Computation.,"The most common evolutionary events at the molecular level are single-base substitutions, as well as insertions and deletions (indels) of short DNA segments. A large body of research has been devoted to develop probabilistic substitution models and to infer their parameters using likelihood and Bayesian approaches. In contrast, relatively little has been done to model indel dynamics, probably due to the difficulty in writing explicit likelihood functions. Here, we contribute to the effort of modeling indel dynamics by presenting SpartaABC, an approximate Bayesian computation (ABC) approach to infer indel parameters from sequence data (either aligned or unaligned). SpartaABC circumvents the need to use an explicit likelihood function by extracting summary statistics from simulated sequences. First, summary statistics are extracted from the input sequence data. Second, SpartaABC samples indel parameters from a prior distribution and uses them to simulate sequences. Third, it computes summary statistics from the simulated sets of sequences. By computing a distance between the summary statistics extracted from the input and each simulation, SpartaABC can provide an approximation to the posterior distribution of indel parameters as well as point estimates. We study the performance of our methodology and show that it provides accurate estimates of indel parameters in simulations. We next demonstrate the utility of SpartaABC by studying the impact of alignment errors on the inference of positive selection.

PMC5888665,T253. THE CORRELATION ANALYSIS BETWEEN RENAMING SCHIZOPHRENIA AND VISITING FREQUENCY OF MENTAL HEALTH SERVICES BY BIG DATA ANALYSIS (INTERNET SEARCHES AND NEWSPAPER ARTICLES) IN SOUTH KOREA,"Abstract <h4>Background</h4> Korean Neuropsychiatric Association changed the Korean term for schizophrenia from ësplit-mind disorderí to ëattunement disorderí in 2012, to dispel the stigma associated with name, and to promote early detection and treatment. Information on the internet affects the public awareness and attitude toward schizophrenia. The main purpose of this study was to investigate the correlation between renaming schizophrenia and the pattern of mental health services utilization by big data analysis of internet (newspaper articles and internet searches) in Korea. <h4>Methods</h4> From January 2016 to September 2017, newspaper articles on ìattunement disorderî and ìsplit-mind disorderî available on the internet were classified as related with negative images like crime and helpful or positive in dispelling the stigma. The relationship between the number of anti-stigma newspaper articles and newspaper articles of schizophrenia containing both positive and negative images was examined. In addition, using Naver, a major internet search engine in Korea, we investigated the total number of internet searches of both old and new name of schizophrenia by gender differences. Finally, the frequency of the visits of mental health services of patients with schizophrenia was measured using the Korean Healthcare Bigdata Hub (http://opendata.hira.or.kr/home.do#none) for 14 months and the correlation between the frequency of the visits and the above big data was examined. The data were analyzed using the SPSS/WIN 24.0. Pearson correlation coefficients were used to analyze correlations. <h4>Results</h4> The amounts of newspaper articles containing anti-stigma of schizophrenia were correlated with the amounts of newspaper articles containing negative images like crime of the new name (attunement disorder) of schizophrenia (r=0.528, p<0.01), which was greater than the amounts of newspaper articles containing the old name (split-mind disorder) of schizophrenia (r=0.300, p<0.01). We also found that a strong positive correlation between the number of articles about ìattunement disorderî and search frequency about the term on the internet. In addition, the search frequency was more highly related to the number of articles containing negative images of the illness (e.g., related crimes, r = 0.910, p<0.01) than that of articles providing positive aspects of the illness (e.g., dispelling stigma, r = 0.423, p<0.01). There was no significant correlation between the number of schizophrenia-related newspaper articles in previous month and the visits of mental health services of patients with schizophrenia in next month. There were no gender differences in internet searches. The correlation between the internet search frequency for ìattunement disorderî in the previous month and the visits of the mental health services of patients with schizophrenia (r = 0.185, p>0.05) in next month was larger than the correlation of ìsplit-mind disorderî searches with mental health services utilization (r = 0.082, p>0.05). <h4>Discussion</h4> ìAttunement disorderî rather than ìsplit-mind disorderî was appeared more frequently in newspaper articles of the anti-stigma characteristics. ìAttunement disorderî seems to be more useful for anti-stigma campaign. Renaming schizophrenia didnít seem to affect the visiting frequency of mental health services. There was statistical limitation which was originated from the lack of numbers of patientís information. It was because Korean Bigdata Hub provided patients information just for 14 months as monthly data. Also, it should be considered that the time period, the kinds of mental disorders and the search engine we investigated were limited. Future research needs to overcome these limitations.",0,

These were donated by the Berlin Garden and Botanical Museum from the collection of Siegfried Huneck to be analyzed by LC-MS/MS. Spectra at individual collision energies were submitted to MetaboLights (https://www.ebi.ac.uk/metabolights/MTBLS999) while merged spectra were uploaded to the GNPS platform (CCMSLIB00004751209 to CCMSLIB00004751517). Technical validation was achieved by dereplicating three lichen extracts using a Molecular Networking approach, revealing the detection of eleven unique molecules that would have been missed without LDB implementation to the GNPS. From a chemist's viewpoint, this database should help streamlining the isolation of formerly unreported metabolites. From a taxonomist perspective, the LDB offers a versatile tool for the chemical profiling of newly reported species.",1,
30411228,Steady Flow in a Patient-Averaged Inferior Vena Cava-Part I: Particle Image Velocimetry Measurements at Rest and Exercise Conditions.,"<h4>Purpose</h4>Although many previous computational fluid dynamics (CFD) studies have investigated the hemodynamics in the inferior vena cava (IVC), few studies have compared computational predictions to experimental data, and only qualitative comparisons have been made. Herein, we provide particle image velocimetry (PIV) measurements of flow in a patient-averaged IVC geometry under idealized conditions typical of those used in the preclinical evaluation of IVC filters.<h4>Methods</h4>Measurements are acquired under rest and exercise flow rate conditions in an optically transparent model fabricated using 3D printing. To ensure that boundary conditions are well-defined and to make follow-on CFD validation studies more convenient, fully-developed flow is provided at the inlets (i.e., the iliac veins) by extending them with straight rigid tubing longer than the estimated entrance lengths. Velocity measurements are then obtained at the downstream end of the tubing to confirm Poiseuille inflow boundary conditions.<h4>Results</h4>Measurements in the infrarenal IVC reveal that flow profiles are blunter in the sagittal plane (minor axis) than in the coronal plane (major axis). Peak in-plane velocity magnitudes are 4.9†cm/s and 27†cm/s under the rest and exercise conditions, respectively. Flow profiles are less parabolic and exhibit more inflection points at the higher flow rate. Bimodal velocity peaks are also observed in the sagittal plane at the elevated flow condition.<h4>Conclusions</h4>The IVC geometry, boundary conditions, and infrarenal velocity measurements are provided for download on a free and publicly accessible repository†at https://doi.org/10.6084/m9.figshare.7198703 . These data will facilitate future CFD validation studies of idealized, in vitro IVC hemodynamics and of similar laminar flows in vascular geometries.",0,
25551368,PD_NGSAtlas: a reference database combining next-generation sequencing epigenomic and transcriptomic data for psychiatric disorders.,"<h4>Background</h4>Psychiatric disorders such as schizophrenia (SZ) and bipolar disorder (BP) are projected to lead the global disease burden within the next decade. Several lines of evidence suggest that epigenetic- or genetic-mediated dysfunction is frequently present in these disorders. To date, the inheritance patterns have been complicated by the problem of integrating epigenomic and transcriptomic factors that have yet to be elucidated. Therefore, there is a need to build a comprehensive database for storing epigenomic and transcriptomic data relating to psychiatric disorders.<h4>Description</h4>We have developed the PD_NGSAtlas, which focuses on the efficient storage of epigenomic and transcriptomic data based on next-generation sequencing and on the quantitative analyses of epigenetic and transcriptional alterations involved in psychiatric disorders. The current release of the PD_NGSAtlas contains 43 DNA methylation profiles and 37 transcription profiles detected by MeDIP-Seq and RNA-Seq, respectively, in two distinct brain regions and peripheral blood of SZ, BP and non-psychiatric controls. In addition to these data that were generated in-house, we have included, and will continue to include, published DNA methylation and gene expression data from other research groups, with a focus on psychiatric disorders. A flexible query engine has been developed for the acquisition of methylation profiles and transcription profiles for special genes or genomic regions of interest of the selected samples. Furthermore, the PD_NGSAtlas offers online tools for identifying aberrantly methylated and expressed events involved in psychiatric disorders. A genome browser has been developed to provide integrative and detailed views of multidimensional data in a given genomic context, which can help researchers understand molecular mechanisms from epigenetic and transcriptional perspectives. Moreover, users can download the methylation and transcription data for further analyses.<h4>Conclusions</h4>The PD_NGSAtlas aims to provide storage of epigenomic and transcriptomic data as well as quantitative analyses of epigenetic and transcriptional alterations involved in psychiatric disorders.

31633588,Widespread Pain Is Associated with Increased Risk of No Clinical Improvement After TKA in Women.,"<h4>Background</h4>When conservative treatments do not work, TKA may be the best option for patients with knee osteoarthritis, although a relatively large proportion of individuals do not have clinically important improvement after TKA. Evidence also suggests that women are less likely to benefit from TKA than men, but the reasons are unclear. Widespread pain disproportionately affects women and has been associated with worse outcomes after joint arthroplasty, yet it is unknown if the effect of widespread pain on TKA outcomes differs by patient gender.<h4>Questions/purposes</h4>(1) Does the association between widespread pain and no clinically important improvement in osteoarthritis-related pain and disability 2 years after TKA differ between men and women? (2) Does the use of pain medications 2 years after TKA differ between those with widespread pain and those without widespread pain before surgery?<h4>Methods</h4>Osteoarthritis Initiative (https://nda.nih.gov/oai/) study participants were followed annually from March 2005 until October 2015. Participants who underwent TKA up to the 7-year follow-up visit with pain/disability assessment at the protocol-planned visit before TKA and at the second planned annual visit after surgery were included in the analysis. Among 4796 study participants, 391 had a confirmed TKA, including 315 with pain/disability assessment at the protocol-planned visit before TKA. Overall, 95% of participants (298) had the required follow-up assessment; 5% (17) did not have follow-up data. Widespread pain was defined based on the modified American College of Rheumatology criteria. Symptoms were assessed using the WOMAC pain (range 0 to 20; higher score, more pain) and disability (range 0 to 68; higher score, more disability) scores, and the Knee Injury and Osteoarthritis Outcome Score for pain (range 0 to 100; higher score, less pain). Improvements in pain and disability were classified based on improvement from established clinically important differences (decrease in WOMAC pain = 1.5; decrease in WOMAC disability = 6.0; increase in Knee Injury and Osteoarthritis Outcome Score for pain = 9). At baseline, more women presented with widespread pain than men (45% [84 of 184] versus 32% [36 of 114]). Probability and the relative risk (RR) of no clinically important improvement were estimated using a logistic regression analysis in which participants with widespread pain and those without were compared. The analyses were done for men and women separately, then adjusted for depression and baseline outcome scores.<h4>Results</h4>Among women, preoperative widespread pain was associated with an increased risk of no clinically important improvement 2 years after TKA, based on WOMAC pain scores (13.5% versus 4.6%; RR 2.93 [95% CI 1.18 to 7.30]; p = 0.02) and the Knee Injury and Osteoarthritis Outcome Score for pain (16.5% versus 4.9%; RR 3.39 [95% CI 1.34 to 8.59]; p = 0.02). Given the lower and upper limits of the confidence intervals, our data are compatible with a broad range of disparate associations between widespread pain and lack of clinically important improvement in WOMAC pain scores (RR 0.77 [95% CI 0.22 to 2.70]; p = 0.68) and the Knee Injury and Osteoarthritis Outcome Score for pain (RR 1.37 [95% CI 0.47 to 4.00]; p = 0.57) among men, as well as clinically important improvement in WOMAC disability scores among men (RR 0.72 [95% CI 0.20 to 2.55]; p = 0.61) and women (RR 1.98 [95% CI 0.92 to 4.26]; p = 0.08). Participants presenting with widespread pain before TKA were more likely than those without widespread pain to use medication for symptoms of knee osteoarthritis most days for at least 1 month 2 years after TKA (51% [61 of 120] versus 32% [57 of 178]; mean difference, 18.8 [95% CI 7.3 to 30.1]; p < 0.01).<h4>Conclusions</h4>Widespread pain before TKA was associated with an increased risk of no clinically important improvement in knee pain 2 years postoperatively among women. Because of the small number of men with widespread pain in the sample, the results for men were inconclusive. In clinical practice, screening TKA candidates for widespread pain may be useful, and expectations of surgical outcomes may need to be tempered if patients have a concurrent diagnosis of widespread pain. Future studies should include more men with widespread pain and investigate if treatment of widespread pain before or concurrent with TKA surgery may improve surgical outcomes.<h4>Level of evidence</h4>Level III, therapeutic study.",0,
31307061,PRSice-2: Polygenic Risk Score software for biobank-scale data.,"<h4>Background</h4>Polygenic risk score (PRS) analyses have become an integral part of biomedical research, exploited to gain insights into shared aetiology among traits, to control for genomic profile in experimental studies, and to strengthen causal inference, among a range of applications. Substantial efforts are now devoted to biobank projects to collect large genetic and phenotypic data, providing unprecedented opportunity for genetic discovery and applications. To process the large-scale data provided by such biobank resources, highly efficient and scalable methods and software are required.<h4>Results</h4>Here we introduce PRSice-2, an efficient and scalable software program for automating and simplifying PRS analyses on large-scale data. PRSice-2 handles both genotyped and imputed data, provides empirical association P-values free from inflation due to overfitting, supports different inheritance models, and can evaluate multiple continuous and binary target traits simultaneously. We demonstrate that PRSice-2 is dramatically faster and more memory-efficient than PRSice-1 and alternative PRS software, LDpred and lassosum, while having comparable predictive power.<h4>Conclusion</h4>PRSice-2's combination of efficiency and power will be increasingly important as data sizes grow and as the applications of PRS become more sophisticated, e.g., when incorporated into high-dimensional or gene set-based analyses. PRSice-2 is written in C++, with an R script for plotting, and is freely available for download from http://PRSice.info.",0,
31642469,PhenoModifier: a genetic modifier database for elucidating the genetic basis of human phenotypic variation.,"From clinical observations to large-scale sequencing studies, the phenotypic impact of genetic modifiers is evident. To better understand the full spectrum of the genetic contribution to human disease, concerted efforts are needed to construct a useful modifier resource for interpreting the information from sequencing data. Here, we present the PhenoModifier (https://www.biosino.org/PhenoModifier), a manually curated database that provides a comprehensive overview of human genetic modifiers. By manually curating over ten thousand published articles, 3078 records of modifier information were entered into the current version of PhenoModifier, related to 288 different disorders, 2126 genetic modifier variants and 843 distinct modifier genes. To help users probe further into the mechanism of their interested modifier genes, we extended the yeast genetic interaction data and yeast quantitative trait loci to the human and we also integrated GWAS data into the PhenoModifier to assist users in evaluating all possible phenotypes associated with a modifier allele. As the first comprehensive resource of human genetic modifiers, PhenoModifier provides a more complete spectrum of genetic factors contributing to human phenotypic variation. The portal has a broad scientific and clinical scope, spanning activities relevant to variant interpretation for research purposes as well as clinical decision making.",1,
33048108,A comprehensive comparison of residue-level methylation levels with the regression-based gene-level methylation estimations by ReGear.,"<h4>Motivation</h4>DNA methylation is a biological process impacting the gene functions without changing the underlying DNA sequence. The DNA methylation machinery usually attaches methyl groups to some specific cytosine residues, which modify the chromatin architectures. Such modifications in the promoter regions will inactivate some tumor-suppressor genes. DNA methylation within the coding region may significantly reduce the transcription elongation efficiency. The gene function may be tuned through some cytosines are methylated.<h4>Methods</h4>This study hypothesizes that the overall methylation level across a gene may have a better association with the sample labels like diseases than the methylations of individual cytosines. The gene methylation level is formulated as a regression model using the methylation levels of all the cytosines within this gene. A comprehensive evaluation of various feature selection algorithms and classification algorithms is carried out between the gene-level and residue-level methylation levels.<h4>Results</h4>A comprehensive evaluation was conducted to compare the gene and cytosine methylation levels for their associations with the sample labels and classification performances. The unsupervised clustering was also improved using the gene methylation levels. Some genes demonstrated statistically significant associations with the class label, even when no residue-level methylation features have statistically significant associations with the class label. So in summary, the trained gene methylation levels improved various methylome-based machine learning models. Both methodology development of regression algorithms and experimental validation of the gene-level methylation biomarkers are worth of further investigations in the future studies.

23729657,"The non-obese diabetic mouse sequence, annotation and variation resource: an aid for investigating type 1 diabetes.","Model organisms are becoming increasingly important for the study of complex diseases such as type 1 diabetes (T1D). The non-obese diabetic (NOD) mouse is an experimental model for T1D having been bred to develop the disease spontaneously in a process that is similar to humans. Genetic analysis of the NOD mouse has identified around 50 disease loci, which have the nomenclature Idd for insulin-dependent diabetes, distributed across at least 11 different chromosomes. In total, 21 Idd regions across 6 chromosomes, that are major contributors to T1D susceptibility or resistance, were selected for finished sequencing and annotation at the Wellcome Trust Sanger Institute. Here we describe the generation of 40.4 mega base-pairs of finished sequence from 289 bacterial artificial chromosomes for the NOD mouse. Manual annotation has identified 738 genes in the diabetes sensitive NOD mouse and 765 genes in homologous regions of the diabetes resistant C57BL/6J reference mouse across 19 candidate Idd regions. This has allowed us to call variation consequences between homologous exonic sequences for all annotated regions in the two mouse strains. We demonstrate the importance of this resource further by illustrating the technical difficulties that regions of inter-strain structural variation between the NOD mouse and the C57BL/6J reference mouse can cause for current next generation sequencing and assembly techniques. Furthermore, we have established that the variation rate in the Idd regions is 2.3 times higher than the mean found for the whole genome assembly for the NOD/ShiLtJ genome, which we suggest reflects the fact that positive selection for functional variation in immune genes is beneficial in regard to host defence. In summary, we provide an important resource, which aids the analysis of potential causative genes involved in T1D susceptibility.

30591010,DLAD4U: deriving and prioritizing disease lists from PubMed literature.,"<h4>Background</h4>Due to recent technology advancements, disease related knowledge is growing rapidly. It becomes nontrivial to go through all published literature to identify associations between human diseases and genetic, environmental, and life style factors, disease symptoms, and treatment strategies. Here we report DLAD4U (Disease List Automatically Derived For You), an efficient, accurate and easy-to-use disease search engine based on PubMed literature.<h4>Results</h4>DLAD4U uses the eSearch and eFetch APIs from the National Center for Biotechnology Information (NCBI) to find publications related to a query and to identify diseases from the retrieved publications. The hypergeometric test was used to prioritize identified diseases for displaying to users. DLAD4U accepts any valid queries for PubMed, and the output results include a ranked disease list, information associated with each disease, chronologically-ordered supporting publications, a summary of the run, and links for file export. DLAD4U outperformed other disease search engines in our comparative evaluation using selected genes and drugs as query terms and manually curated data as ""gold standard"". For 100 genes that are associated with only one disease in the gold standard, the Mean Average Precision (MAP) measure from DLAD4U was 0.77, which clearly outperformed other tools. For 10 genes that are associated with multiple diseases in the gold standard, the mean precision, recall and F-measure scores from DLAD4U were always higher than those from other tools. The superior performance of DLAD4U was further confirmed using 100 drugs as queries, with an MAP of 0.90.<h4>Conclusions</h4>DLAD4U is a new, intuitive disease search engine that takes advantage of existing resources at NCBI to provide computational efficiency and uses statistical analyses to ensure accuracy. DLAD4U is publicly available at http://dlad4u.zhang-lab.org .",0,
23868073,Large-scale gene function analysis with the PANTHER classification system.,"The PANTHER (protein annotation through evolutionary relationship) classification system (http://www.pantherdb.org/) is a comprehensive system that combines gene function, ontology, pathways and statistical analysis tools that enable biologists to analyze large-scale, genome-wide data from sequencing, proteomics or gene expression experiments. The system is built with 82 complete genomes organized into gene families and subfamilies, and their evolutionary relationships are captured in phylogenetic trees, multiple sequence alignments and statistical models (hidden Markov models or HMMs). Genes are classified according to their function in several different ways: families and subfamilies are annotated with ontology terms (Gene Ontology (GO) and PANTHER protein class), and sequences are assigned to PANTHER pathways. The PANTHER website includes a suite of tools that enable users to browse and query gene functions, and to analyze large-scale experimental data with a number of statistical tests. It is widely used by bench scientists, bioinformaticians, computer scientists and systems biologists. In the 2013 release of PANTHER (v.8.0), in addition to an update of the data content, we redesigned the website interface to improve both user experience and the system's analytical capability. This protocol provides a detailed description of how to analyze genome-wide experimental data with the PANTHER classification system.",1,

24270792,Gene3D: Multi-domain annotations for protein sequence and comparative genome analysis.,"Gene3D (http://gene3d.biochem.ucl.ac.uk) is a database of protein domain structure annotations for protein sequences. Domains are predicted using a library of profile HMMs from 2738 CATH superfamilies. Gene3D assigns domain annotations to Ensembl and UniProt sequence sets including >6000 cellular genomes and >20 million unique protein sequences. This represents an increase of 45% in the number of protein sequences since our last publication. Thanks to improvements in the underlying data and pipeline, we see large increases in the domain coverage of sequences. We have expanded this coverage by integrating Pfam and SUPERFAMILY domain annotations, and we now resolve domain overlaps to provide highly comprehensive composite multi-domain architectures. To make these data more accessible for comparative genome analyses, we have developed novel search algorithms for searching genomes to identify related multi-domain architectures. In addition to providing domain family annotations, we have now developed a pipeline for 3D homology modelling of domains in Gene3D. This has been applied to the human genome and will be rolled out to other major organisms over the next year.",1,
30152276,HYPO: A Database of Human Hypothetical Proteins.,"<h4>Background</h4>There are genes whose function remains obscure as they may not have similarities to known regions in the genome. Such known 'unknown' genes constituting the Open Reading Frames (ORF) that remain in the epigenome are termed as orphan genes and the proteins encoded by them but having no experimental evidence of translation are termed as 'Hypothetical Proteins' (HPs).<h4>Objectives</h4>We have enhanced our former database of Hypothetical Proteins (HP) in human (HypoDB) with added annotation, application programming interfaces and descriptive features. The database hosts 1000+ manually curated records of the known 'unknown' regions in the human genome. The new updated version of HypoDB with functionalities (Blast, Match) is freely accessible at http://www.bioclues.org/hypo2.<h4>Methods</h4>The total collection of HPs were checked using experimentally validated sets (from Swiss-Prot) or non-experimentally validated set (TrEMBL) or the complete set (UniProtKB). The database was designed with java at the core backend, integrated with databases, viz. EMBL, PIR, HPRD and those including descriptors for structural databases, interaction and association databases.<h4>Results</h4>The HypoDB constituted Application Programming Interfaces (API) for implicitly searching resources linking them to other databases like NCBI Link-out in addition to multiple search capabilities along with advanced searches using integrated bio-tools, viz. Match and BLAST were incorporated.<h4>Conclusion</h4>The HypoDB is perhaps the only open-source HP database with a range of tools for common bioinformatics retrievals and serves as a standby reference to researchers who are interested in finding candidate sequences for their potential experimental work.",1,
27796840,An IoT-cloud Based Wearable ECG Monitoring System for Smart Healthcare.,"Public healthcare has been paid an increasing attention given the exponential growth human population and medical expenses. It is well known that an effective health monitoring system can detect abnormalities of health conditions in time and make diagnoses according to the gleaned data. As a vital approach to diagnose heart diseases, ECG monitoring is widely studied and applied. However, nearly all existing portable ECG monitoring systems cannot work without a mobile application, which is responsible for data collection and display. In this paper, we propose a new method for ECG monitoring based on Internet-of-Things (IoT) techniques. ECG data are gathered using a wearable monitoring node and are transmitted directly to the IoT cloud using Wi-Fi. Both the HTTP and MQTT protocols are employed in the IoT cloud in order to provide visual and timely ECG data to users. Nearly all smart terminals with a web browser can acquire ECG data conveniently, which has greatly alleviated the cross-platform issue. Experiments are carried out on healthy volunteers in order to verify the reliability of the entire system. Experimental results reveal that the proposed system is reliable in collecting and displaying real-time ECG data, which can aid in the primary diagnosis of certain heart diseases.",0,
31573931,Development of Ovarian Tissue Autograft to Restore Ovarian Function: Protocol for a French Multicenter Cohort Study.,"BACKGROUND:Sterility is a major late effect of radiotherapy and chemotherapy treatments. Iatrogenic sterility is often permanent and greatly impacts long-term quality of life. Ovarian tissue cryopreservation (OTC) performed before gonadotoxic treatments with subsequent autograft is a method of fertility preservation available for girls and women. Its application in prepubertal girls is of particular value as it is the only possible approach in this patient group. In addition, it does not require a delay in cancer therapy and no ovarian stimulation is needed. OBJECTIVE:The primary aim of this protocol is to help increase the implementation of ovarian tissue autografting in France. Knowledge is still lacking regarding the efficacy of ovarian transplantation in restoring ovarian function and regarding the safety of this procedure, especially the risk of cancer cell reseeding in certain types of cancer. A secondary aim of this study is to generate data to improve our understanding of these two essential aspects. METHODS:The DATOR (Development of Ovarian Tissue Autograft in Order to Restore Ovarian Function) study is ongoing in 17 university hospitals. The DATOR protocol includes the autograft of ovarian cortex fragments. Candidates are identified from an observational prospective cohort (called the Prospective Cohort of Patients Candidates for Ovarian Tissue Autograft [PERIDATOR]) of patients who have undergone OTC. Enrollment in the study is initiated at the patient's request and must be validated by the center's multidisciplinary team and by the study steering committee. The DATOR study begins with a total medical checkup. Ovarian tissue qualification and residual disease detection, if required, are performed. RESULTS:The study is ongoing. Currently, 38 patients have provided informed consent and have been entered into the DATOR study. Graft has been performed for 34 of these patients. An interim analysis was conducted on the first 25 patients for whom the period of at least 1 year posttransplantation was achieved. Out of these 25 patients, 11 women succeeded in becoming pregnant (pregnancy rate=44% [11/25]; delivery rate=40% [10/25]). Among these, 6 women conceived twice, and 1 pregnancy led to a miscarriage. CONCLUSIONS:Our preliminary analysis appears to be coherent with the accumulating body of evidence indicating the potential utility of ovarian tissue autograft for patients with premature ovarian failure. All these elements justify the pursuit of our study. TRIAL REGISTRATION:ClinicalTrials.gov NCT02846064; https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT02846064.

23930024,PROcEED: Probabilistic reverse dosimetry approaches for estimating exposure distributions.,"<h4>Unlabelled</h4>As increasing amounts of biomonitoring survey data become available, a new discipline focused on converting such data into estimates of chemical exposures has developed. Reverse dosimetry uses a pharmacokinetic model along with measured biomarker concentrations to determine the plausible exposure concentrations-- a critical step to incorporate ground-truthing experimental data into a distribution of probable exposures that reduces model uncertainty and variability. At the population level, probabilistic reverse dosimetry can utilize a distribution of measured biomarker concentrations to identify the most likely exposure concentrations (or intake doses) experienced by the study participants. PROcEED is software that provides access to probabilistic reverse dosimetry approaches for estimating exposure distributions via a simple user interface.<h4>Availability</h4>PROcEED along with installation instructions is freely available for download from http://www.epa.gov/heasd/products/proceed/proceed.html.",0,
21330288,Sensitive gene fusion detection using ambiguously mapping RNA-Seq read pairs.,"<h4>Motivation</h4>Paired-end whole transcriptome sequencing provides evidence for fusion transcripts. However, due to the repetitiveness of the transcriptome, many reads have multiple high-quality mappings. Previous methods to find gene fusions either ignored these reads or required additional longer single reads. This can obscure up to 30% of fusions and unnecessarily discards much of the data.<h4>Results</h4>We present a method for using paired-end reads to find fusion transcripts without requiring unique mappings or additional single read sequencing. Using simulated data and data from tumors and cell lines, we show that our method can find fusions with ambiguously mapping read pairs without generating numerous spurious fusions from the many mapping locations.<h4>Availability</h4>A C++ and Python implementation of the method demonstrated in this article is available at http://exon.ucsd.edu/ShortFuse.<h4>Contact</h4>mckinsel@ucsd.edu<h4>Supplementary information</h4>Supplementary data are available at Bioinformatics online.",0,
27307645,BioASF: a framework for automatically generating executable pathway models specified in BioPAX.,"<h4>Motivation</h4>Biological pathways play a key role in most cellular functions. To better understand these functions, diverse computational and cell biology researchers use biological pathway data for various analysis and modeling purposes. For specifying these biological pathways, a community of researchers has defined BioPAX and provided various tools for creating, validating and visualizing BioPAX models. However, a generic software framework for simulating BioPAX models is missing. Here, we attempt to fill this gap by introducing a generic simulation framework for BioPAX. The framework explicitly separates the execution model from the model structure as provided by BioPAX, with the advantage that the modelling process becomes more reproducible and intrinsically more modular; this ensures natural biological constraints are satisfied upon execution. The framework is based on the principles of discrete event systems and multi-agent systems, and is capable of automatically generating a hierarchical multi-agent system for a given BioPAX model.<h4>Results</h4>To demonstrate the applicability of the framework, we simulated two types of biological network models: a gene regulatory network modeling the haematopoietic stem cell regulators and a signal transduction network modeling the Wnt/ﬂ-catenin signaling pathway. We observed that the results of the simulations performed using our framework were entirely consistent with the simulation results reported by the researchers who developed the original models in a proprietary language.<h4>Availability and implementation</h4>The framework, implemented in Java, is open source and its source code, documentation and tutorial are available at http://www.ibi.vu.nl/programs/BioASF CONTACT: j.heringa@vu.nl.",0,
32214380,Stochastic simulation and statistical inference platform for visualization and estimation of transcriptional kinetics.,"Recent advances in single-molecule fluorescent imaging have enabled quantitative measurements of transcription at a single gene copy, yet an accurate understanding of transcriptional kinetics is still lacking due to the difficulty of solving detailed biophysical models. Here we introduce a stochastic simulation and statistical inference platform for modeling detailed transcriptional kinetics in prokaryotic systems, which has not been solved analytically. The model includes stochastic two-state gene activation, mRNA synthesis initiation and stepwise elongation, release to the cytoplasm, and stepwise co-transcriptional degradation. Using the Gillespie algorithm, the platform simulates nascent and mature mRNA kinetics of a single gene copy and predicts fluorescent signals measurable by time-lapse single-cell mRNA imaging, for different experimental conditions. To approach the inverse problem of estimating the kinetic parameters of the model from experimental data, we develop a heuristic optimization method based on the genetic algorithm and the empirical distribution of mRNA generated by simulation. As a demonstration, we show that the optimization algorithm can successfully recover the transcriptional kinetics of simulated and experimental gene expression data. The platform is available as a MATLAB software package at https://data.caltech.edu/records/1287.",0,

Herein, I introduce for the first time a novel database called RTFAdb, which allows exploring computationally predicted associations between retrotransposons and TFs in diverse cell lines and tissues of human and mouse. My database, using over 3.000 TF ChIP-seq binding profiles collected from human and mouse samples, makes possible searching more than 1.500 retrotransposon species in the binding sites of a total of 596 TFs.

By modeling the patterns of linkage disequilibrium in a reference panel, genotypes not directly measured in the study samples can be imputed and used for GWASs. Since millions of single nucleotide polymorphisms need to be imputed in a GWAS, faster methods for genotype imputation and haplotype reconstruction are required.<h4>Results</h4>We developed a program package for parallel computation of genotype imputation and haplotype reconstruction. Our program package, ParaHaplo 3.0, is intended for use in workstation clusters using the Intel Message Passing Interface. We compared the performance of ParaHaplo 3.0 on the Japanese in Tokyo, Japan and Han Chinese in Beijing, and Chinese in the HapMap dataset. A parallel version of ParaHaplo 3.0 can conduct genotype imputation 20 times faster than a non-parallel version of ParaHaplo.<h4>Conclusions</h4>ParaHaplo 3.0 is an invaluable tool for conducting haplotype-based GWASs. The need for faster genotype imputation and haplotype reconstruction using parallel computing will become increasingly important as the data sizes of such projects continue to increase.

22847931,Deep architectures for protein contact map prediction.,"<h4>Motivation</h4>Residue-residue contact prediction is important for protein structure prediction and other applications. However, the accuracy of current contact predictors often barely exceeds 20% on long-range contacts, falling short of the level required for ab initio structure prediction.<h4>Results</h4>Here, we develop a novel machine learning approach for contact map prediction using three steps of increasing resolution. First, we use 2D recursive neural networks to predict coarse contacts and orientations between secondary structure elements. Second, we use an energy-based method to align secondary structure elements and predict contact probabilities between residues in contacting alpha-helices or strands. Third, we use a deep neural network architecture to organize and progressively refine the prediction of contacts, integrating information over both space and time. We train the architecture on a large set of non-redundant proteins and test it on a large set of non-homologous domains, as well as on the set of protein domains used for contact prediction in the two most recent CASP8 and CASP9 experiments. For long-range contacts, the accuracy of the new CMAPpro predictor is close to 30%, a significant increase over existing approaches.<h4>Availability</h4>CMAPpro is available as part of the SCRATCH suite at http://scratch.proteomics.ics.uci.edu/.<h4>Contact</h4>pfbaldi@uci.edu<h4>Supplementary information</h4>Supplementary data are available at Bioinformatics online.",0,
33870774,The association between relationship strain and emotional well-being among older adult couples: the moderating role of social connectedness.,"<h4>Objectives</h4>The present study examines the moderating role of social connectedness (i.e. closeness, talk frequency, social network size, and neighborhood social ties) in the association between one's own and spouse's relationship strain and emotional well-being (i.e. depressive symptoms, happiness, and loneliness).<h4>Method</h4>Married couples (<i>N</i> = 865) were drawn from the second wave of the National Social, Health, and Aging Project. One Actor Partner Interdependence Model (APIM) and one Actor Partner Interdependence Model with Moderation (APIMoM) were conducted.<h4>Results</h4>In terms of actor effects, relationship strain was associated with all emotional well-being outcomes. Wives' and husbands' greater relationship strain was associated with spouses' loneliness. Only wives' greater relationship strain was associated with her husbands' higher level of depressive symptoms and no partner effects were found for happiness. In six instances, social connectedness factors helped to ameliorate the association between self/spouse relationship strain, depressive symptoms, and happiness. However, wives' greater neighborhood social ties amplified the association between wives greater relationship strain and husbands' greater depressive symptoms. We did not find that social connectedness factors moderated the associations between self/spouse relationship strain and loneliness.<h4>Conclusion</h4>Even in late life marriages, marital strain is associated with less happiness and greater depressive symptoms and loneliness. Practitioners addressing emotional well-being may need to pay attention to spousal perceptions of relationship strain and social relationships external to the marital relationship when working with heterosexual couples. Efforts throughout the life course should be made to ensure connections with diverse types of social networks.Supplemental data for this article is available online at https://doi.org/10.1080/13607863.2021.1910786.",0,
32811511,Advancing brain barriers RNA sequencing: guidelines from experimental design to publication.,"<h4>Background</h4>RNA sequencing (RNA-Seq) in its varied forms has become an indispensable tool for analyzing differential gene expression and thus characterization of specific tissues. Aiming to understand the brain barriers genetic signature, RNA seq has also been introduced in brain barriers research. This has led to availability of both, bulk and single-cell RNA-Seq datasets over the last few years. If appropriately performed, the RNA-Seq studies provide powerful datasets that allow for significant deepening of knowledge on the molecular mechanisms that establish the brain barriers. However, RNA-Seq studies comprise complex workflows that require to consider many options and variables before, during and after the proper sequencing process.<h4>Main body</h4>In the current manuscript, we build on the interdisciplinary experience of the European PhD Training Network BtRAIN ( https://www.btrain-2020.eu/ ) where bioinformaticians and brain barriers researchers collaborated to analyze and establish RNA-Seq datasets on vertebrate brain barriers. The obstacles BtRAIN has identified in this process have been integrated into the present manuscript. It provides guidelines along the entire workflow of brain barriers RNA-Seq studies starting from the overall experimental design to interpretation of results. Focusing on the vertebrate endothelial blood-brain barrier (BBB) and epithelial blood-cerebrospinal-fluid barrier (BCSFB) of the choroid plexus, we provide a step-by-step description of the workflow, highlighting the decisions to be made at each step of the workflow and explaining the strengths and weaknesses of individual choices made. Finally, we propose recommendations for accurate data interpretation and on the information to be included into a publication to ensure appropriate accessibility of the data and reproducibility of the observations by the scientific community.<h4>Conclusion</h4>Next generation transcriptomic profiling of the brain barriers provides a novel resource for understanding the development, function and pathology of these barrier cells, which is essential for understanding CNS homeostasis and disease. Continuous advancement and sophistication of RNA-Seq will require interdisciplinary approaches between brain barrier researchers and bioinformaticians as successfully performed in BtRAIN. The present guidelines are built on the BtRAIN interdisciplinary experience and aim to facilitate collaboration of brain barriers researchers with bioinformaticians to advance RNA-Seq study design in the brain barriers community.",0,
31099384,NGSEP3: accurate variant calling across species and sequencing protocols.,"<h4>Motivation</h4>Accurate detection, genotyping and downstream analysis of genomic variants from high-throughput sequencing data are fundamental features in modern production pipelines for genetic-based diagnosis in medicine or genomic selection in plant and animal breeding. Our research group maintains the Next-Generation Sequencing Experience Platform (NGSEP) as a precise, efficient and easy-to-use software solution for these features.<h4>Results</h4>Understanding that incorrect alignments around short tandem repeats are an important source of genotyping errors, we implemented in NGSEP new algorithms for realignment and haplotype clustering of reads spanning indels and short tandem repeats. We performed extensive benchmark experiments comparing NGSEP to state-of-the-art software using real data from three sequencing protocols and four species with different distributions of repetitive elements. NGSEP consistently shows comparative accuracy and better efficiency compared to the existing solutions. We expect that this work will contribute to the continuous improvement of quality in variant calling needed for modern applications in medicine and agriculture.<h4>Availability and implementation</h4>NGSEP is available as open source software at http://ngsep.sf.net.<h4>Supplementary information</h4>Supplementary data are available at Bioinformatics online.",0,

22861649,A re-evaluation of 9-HODE activity at TRPV1 channels in comparison with anandamide: enantioselectivity and effects at other TRP channels and in sensory neurons.,"<h4>Background and purpose</h4>Two oxidation products of linoleic acid, 9- and 13-hydroxy-octadecadienoic acids (HODEs), have recently been suggested to act as endovanilloids, that is, endogenous agonists of transient receptor potential vanilloid-1 (TRPV1) channels, thereby contributing to inflammatory hyperalgesia in rats. However, HODE activity at rat TRPV1 in comparison with the best established endovanilloid, anandamide, and its enantioselectivity and selectivity towards other TRP channels that are also abundant in sensory neurons have never been investigated.<h4>Experimental approach</h4>We studied the effect of 9(R)-HODE, 9(S)-HODE, (+/-)13-HODE, 15(S)-hydroxyanandamide and anandamide on [Ca(2+) ](i)  in HEK-293 cells stably expressing the rat or human recombinant TRPV1, or rat recombinant TRPV2, TRPA1 or TRPM8, and also the effect of 9(S)-HODE in rat dorsal root ganglion (DRG) neurons by calcium imaging.<h4>Key results</h4>Anandamide and 15(S)-hydroxyanandamide were the most potent endovanilloids at human TRPV1, whereas 9(S)-HODE was approximately threefold less efficacious and 75- and 3-fold less potent, respectively, and did not perform much better at rat TRPV1. The 9(R)-HODE and (+/-)13-HODE were almost inactive at TRPV1. Unlike anandamide and 15(S)-hydroxyanandamide, all HODEs were very weak at desensitizing TRPV1 to the action of capsaicin, but activated rat TRPV2 [only (+/-)13-HODE] and rat TRPA1, and antagonized rat TRPM8, at concentrations higher than those required to activate TRPV1. Finally, 9(S)-HODE elevated [Ca(2+) ](i)  in DRG neurons almost exclusively in capsaicin-sensitive cells but only at concentrations between 25 and 100 µM.<h4>Conclusions and implications</h4>The present data suggest that HODEs are less important endovanilloids than anandamide.<h4>Linked articles</h4>This article is part of a themed section on Cannabinoids.

29617941,A reference peptide database for proteome quantification based on experimental mass spectrum response curves.,"<h4>Motivation</h4>Mass spectrometry (MS) based quantification of proteins/peptides has become a powerful tool in biological research with high sensitivity and throughput. The accuracy of quantification, however, has been problematic as not all peptides are suitable for quantification. Several methods and tools have been developed to identify peptides that response well in mass spectrometry and they are mainly based on predictive models, and rarely consider the linearity of the response curve, limiting the accuracy and applicability of the methods. An alternative solution is to select empirically superior peptides that offer satisfactory MS response intensity and linearity in a wide dynamic range of peptide concentration.<h4>Results</h4>We constructed a reference database for proteome quantification based on experimental mass spectrum response curves. The intensity and dynamic range of over 2 647 773 transitions from 121 318 peptides were obtained from a set of dilution experiments, covering 11 040 gene products. These transitions and peptides were evaluated and presented in a database named SCRIPT-MAP. We showed that the best-responder (BR) peptide approach for quantification based on SCRIPT-MAP database is robust, repeatable and accurate in proteome-scale protein quantification. This study provides a reference database as well as a peptides/transitions selection method for quantitative proteomics.<h4>Availability and implementation</h4>SCRIPT-MAP database is available at http://www.firmiana.org/responders/.<h4>Supplementary information</h4>Supplementary data are available at Bioinformatics online.",1,
33511845,FMODB: The World's First Database of Quantum Mechanical Calculations for Biomacromolecules Based on the Fragment Molecular Orbital Method.,"We developed the world's first web-based public database for the storage, management, and sharing of fragment molecular orbital (FMO) calculation data sets describing the complex interactions between biomacromolecules, named FMO Database (https://drugdesign.riken.jp/FMODB/). Each entry in the database contains relevant background information on how the data was compiled as well as the total energy of each molecular system and interfragment interaction energy (IFIE) and pair interaction energy decomposition analysis (PIEDA) values. Currently, the database contains more than 13†600 FMO calculation data sets, and a comprehensive search function implemented at the front-end. The procedure for selecting target proteins, preprocessing the experimental structures, construction of the database, and details of the database front-end were described. Then, we demonstrated a use of the FMODB by comparing IFIE value distributions of hydrogen bond, ion-pair, and XH/p interactions obtained by FMO method to those by molecular mechanics approach. From the comparison, the statistical analysis of the data provided standard reference values for the three types of interactions that will be useful for determining whether each interaction in a given system is relatively strong or weak compared to the interactions contained within the data in the FMODB. In the final part, we demonstrate the use of the database to examine the contribution of halogen atoms to the binding affinity between human cathepsin L and its inhibitors. We found that the electrostatic term derived by PIEDA greatly correlated with the binding affinities of the halogen containing cathepsin L inhibitors, indicating the importance of QM calculation for quantitative analysis of halogen interactions. Thus, the FMO calculation data in FMODB will be useful for conducting statistical analyses to drug discovery, for conducting molecular recognition studies in structural biology, and for other studies involving quantum mechanics-based interactions.",1,
27899584,CATH: an expanded resource to predict protein function through structure and sequence.,"The latest version of the CATH-Gene3D protein structure classification database has recently been released (version 4.1, http://www.cathdb.info). The resource comprises over 300 000 domain structures and over 53 million protein domains classified into 2737 homologous superfamilies, doubling the number of predicted protein domains in the previous version. The daily-updated CATH-B, which contains our very latest domain assignment data, provides putative classifications for over 100 000 additional protein domains. This article describes developments to the CATH-Gene3D resource over the last two years since the publication in 2015, including: significant increases to our structural and sequence coverage; expansion of the functional families in CATH; building a support vector machine (SVM) to automatically assign domains to superfamilies; improved search facilities to return alignments of query sequences against multiple sequence alignments; the redesign of the web pages and download site.",1,
28985416,EVLncRNAs: a manually curated database for long non-coding RNAs validated by low-throughput experiments.,"Long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) play important functional roles in various biological processes. Early databases were utilized to deposit all lncRNA candidates produced by high-throughput experimental and/or computational techniques to facilitate classification, assessment and validation. As more lncRNAs are validated by low-throughput experiments, several databases were established for experimentally validated lncRNAs. However, these databases are small in scale (with a few hundreds of lncRNAs only) and specific in their focuses (plants, diseases or interactions). Thus, it is highly desirable to have a comprehensive dataset for experimentally validated lncRNAs as a central repository for all of their structures, functions and phenotypes. Here, we established EVLncRNAs by curating lncRNAs validated by low-throughput experiments (up to 1 May 2016) and integrating specific databases (lncRNAdb, LncRANDisease, Lnc2Cancer and PLNIncRBase) with additional functional and disease-specific information not covered previously. The current version of EVLncRNAs contains 1543 lncRNAs from 77 species that is 2.9 times larger than the current largest database for experimentally validated lncRNAs. Seventy-four percent lncRNA entries are partially or completely new, comparing to all existing experimentally validated databases. The established database allows users to browse, search and download as well as to submit experimentally validated lncRNAs. The database is available at http://biophy.dzu.edu.cn/EVLncRNAs.",1,

Endoparasitic specimens of E. nigrocorallium were found associated with three species of antipatharians on the Great Reef of Toliara. Individuals inhabit the gastrovascular ducts of their hosts and evidence of infestation is, most of the time, not visible externally. Phylogenetic analyses based on 18S rDNA, 16S rDNA and COI data indicate a close relation to Eenymeenymyzostoma cirripedium, the only other species of the genus. The morphology of E. nigrocorallium is very unusual compared to that of the more conventional E. cirripedium. The new species has five pairs of extremely reduced parapodia located on the body margin and no introvert, cirri or lateral organs. Individuals are hermaphroditic, with the male and female gonads both being located dorsally in the trunk. It also has a highly developed parenchymo-muscular layer on the ventral side, and the digestive system lies in the middle part of the trunk. A three-dimensional digital model of this worm's body plan has been constructed whereby the external morphology and in toto views of the observed organ systems (nervous, digestive and reproductive) can be viewed on-screen: http://doi.org/10.13140/RG.2.2.17911.21923.",0,
24727366,"'In silico expression analysis', a novel PathoPlant web tool to identify abiotic and biotic stress conditions associated with specific cis-regulatory sequences.","Using bioinformatics, putative cis-regulatory sequences can be easily identified using pattern recognition programs on promoters of specific gene sets. The abundance of predicted cis-sequences is a major challenge to associate these sequences with a possible function in gene expression regulation. To identify a possible function of the predicted cis-sequences, a novel web tool designated 'in silico expression analysis' was developed that correlates submitted cis-sequences with gene expression data from Arabidopsis thaliana. The web tool identifies the A. thaliana genes harbouring the sequence in a defined promoter region and compares the expression of these genes with microarray data. The result is a hierarchy of abiotic and biotic stress conditions to which these genes are most likely responsive. When testing the performance of the web tool, known cis-regulatory sequences were submitted to the 'in silico expression analysis' resulting in the correct identification of the associated stress conditions. When using a recently identified novel elicitor-responsive sequence, a WT-box (CGACTTTT), the 'in silico expression analysis' predicts that genes harbouring this sequence in their promoter are most likely Botrytis cinerea induced. Consistent with this prediction, the strongest induction of a reporter gene harbouring this sequence in the promoter is observed with B. cinerea in transgenic A. thaliana.

22645320,Integrative analysis of gene and miRNA expression profiles with transcription factor-miRNA feed-forward loops identifies regulators in human cancers.,"We describe here a novel method for integrating gene and miRNA expression profiles in cancer using feed-forward loops (FFLs) consisting of transcription factors (TFs), miRNAs and their common target genes. The dChip-GemiNI (Gene and miRNA Network-based Integration) method statistically ranks computationally predicted FFLs by their explanatory power to account for differential gene and miRNA expression between two biological conditions such as normal and cancer. GemiNI integrates not only gene and miRNA expression data but also computationally derived information about TF-target gene and miRNA-mRNA interactions. Literature validation shows that the integrated modeling of expression data and FFLs better identifies cancer-related TFs and miRNAs compared to existing approaches. We have utilized GemiNI for analyzing six data sets of solid cancers (liver, kidney, prostate, lung and germ cell) and found that top-ranked FFLs account for ~20% of transcriptome changes between normal and cancer. We have identified common FFL regulators across multiple cancer types, such as known FFLs consisting of MYC and miR-15/miR-17 families, and novel FFLs consisting of ARNT, CREB1 and their miRNA partners.

25341068,"Udock, the interactive docking entertainment system.","Protein-protein interactions play a crucial role in biological processes. Protein docking calculations' goal is to predict, given two proteins of known structures, the associate conformation of the corresponding complex. Here, we present a new interactive protein docking system, Udock, that makes use of users' cognitive capabilities added up. In Udock, the users tackle simplified representations of protein structures and explore protein-protein interfaces' conformational space using a gamified interactive docking system with on the fly scoring. We assumed that if given appropriate tools, a naÔve user's cognitive capabilities could provide relevant data for (1) the prediction of correct interfaces in binary protein complexes and (2) the identification of the experimental partner in interaction among a set of decoys. To explore this approach experimentally, we conducted a preliminary two week long playtest where the registered users could perform a cross-docking on a dataset comprising 4 binary protein complexes. The users explored almost all the surface of the proteins that were available in the dataset but favored certain regions that seemed more attractive as potential docking spots. These favored regions were located inside or nearby the experimental binding interface for 5 out of the 8 proteins in the dataset. For most of them, the best scores were obtained with the experimental partner. The alpha version of Udock is freely accessible at http://udock.fr.",0,
IND606827856,Occurrence of the Stunt Nematode Neodolichorhynchus sulcatus as Pathogen of Pepper (Capsicum annuum) in Israel,"Stunt nematodes, family Dolichodoridae, are migratory ectoparasites of roots. They feed on epidermal cells by inserting only the stylet tip into the cellís surface tissue. As one of the less common stunt nematodes, little is known about Neodolichorhynchus sulcatus (de Guiran, 1967) Jairajpuri & Hunt, 1984. To date, it has been reported from Morocco (de Guiran 1967), Spain (Tobar-Jime¥nez 1970), Cameroon (Sakwe and Geraert 1991), India (Sultan et al. 1995), and Iran (Pourjam et al. 2011). This is the first detection of N. sulcatus infecting pepper (variety 1204 Alef Beit Zeraim) root from a farm in Ein Yahav, Arava Rift, Israel (30∞39'54.3''N, 35∞15'02.9''E). In March 2019, we observed decline in development of pepper plants. We recovered nematodes from the pepper root zone at high population density. Nematodes were extracted from the soil using the Baermann tray technique. Identification was based on a combination of molecular and morphological methods. Genomic DNA was extracted from a single fresh nematode; amplicons from 18S rRNA, 28S D2 to D3 rRNA, and the intergenic spacer (ITS) region were generated following the procedure detailed in Qing et al. (2019); and sequencing was performed. The sequences were submitted to GenBank with accession numbers MK96525 to MK965256 (28S), MK965252 (18S), and MK965249 and MK965250 (ITS), providing the first rRNA data for N. sulcatus. Phylogenetic analysis placed this species as sister to Bitylenchus iphilus in 18S (98.15% similar in BLAST), sister to Paratrophurus bhutanensis in 28S (91.68% similar in BLAST), or sister to a well-supported clade containing B. iphilus (91.35% similar in BLAST, highest match), B. maximus, B. hispaniensis, P. bhutanensis, and P. bursifer in ITS (figures for phylogeny trees available at https://photos.app.goo.gl/2Y7fToEftBopbnB67). Although our species were not clustered with other Neodolichorhynchus species, morphology and morphometry confirmed its identity as N. sulcatus, including the cephalic region offset, basal bulb pyriform, a cuticle with 16 longitudinal ridges including the lateral fields, irregularly areolated lateral fields with three ridges, bursa not notched at tail tip, gubernaculum with smooth proximal end, and vulva lacking lateral flaps, tail cylindroid-conical with rounded and smooth terminus. Measurements (mean ± standard error, range, in µm) for female (n = 10): body length 801 ± 49.4 (731 to 901), anterior end to vulva 435 ± 34.8 (410 to 520), V value 54.2 ± 1.69 (52.4 to 57.7), lip height 4.53 ± 0.31 (4.39 to 5.41), stylet length 21.4 ± 0.37 (20.6 to 21.8), cone of stylet 11.4 ± 0.63 (10.7 to 12.8), anterior end to center of median bulb 86.0 ± 3.53 (78.7 to 91.3), pharynx length 146 ± 4.05 (139 to 153), maximum body width 25.6 ± 1.00 (24 to 27), anus/cloacal width 15.7 ± 1.39 (14.3 to 17.9), tail length 47.2 ± 3.85 (43.4 to 56.5); for male (n = 7): body length 786 ± 64.0 (704 to 874), lip height 4.34 ± 0.55 (3.67 to 5.24), stylet length 20.4 ± 0.73 (19.7 to 21.7), cone of stylet 10.9 ± 0.82 (10.3 to 12.7), anterior end to median bulb 81.2 ± 3.54 (75.2 to 87), pharynx length 138 ± 6.66 (132 to 148), maximum body width 22.6 ± 2.15 (20.4 to 25.8), anus/cloacal width 17.7 ± 1.50 (15.2 to 19.9), tail length 54.7 ± 5.67 (46.6 to 62.6), spicule length 26.3 ± 1.21 (24.2 to 27.6). To confirm pathogenicity, we performed inoculation assays in greenhouse conditions. Individual nematodes were manually picked, and 300 juveniles were inoculated onto healthy pepper (variety Maccabi) roots growing in sterile soil in a greenhouse. Three pots with four pepper plants per pot were inoculated, and three noninoculated pots served as a control. Nematodes were harvested from the root and soil 40 days after inoculation, yielding an average of 483 ± 75 nematodes per pot. We observed a reduction in plant growth and necrotic spots on the roots similar to those infected pepper in Ein Yahav. These results confirmed the nematodeís pathogenicity to pepper.

32130186,A 21-Day School-Based Toothbrushing Intervention in Children Aged 6 to 9 Years in Indonesia and Nigeria: Protocol for a Two-Arm Superiority Randomized Controlled Trial.,"BACKGROUND:The World Health Organization reports that dental cavities affect 60% to 90% of children globally. FDI World Dental Federation and Unilever Oral Care have developed public health programs to improve brushing habits over their 12-year partnership. The last of these (phase III) named Brush Day & Night aimed to educate children on brushing twice daily with a fluoride toothpaste and gave useful information for a new project, phase IV. The 21-day Brush Day & Night program is an intense education activity designed to establish the habit of brushing day and night with a fluoride toothpaste. The program involves daily brushing instruction and includes free toothpaste and toothbrushes. OBJECTIVE:The main objective of the study is to evaluate the impact of a 21-day school program on children's oral health. As a secondary objective, we aim to evaluate the impact on the knowledge, behavior, toothbrushing habits, and quality of life in school children aged 6 to 9 years after a 21-day school program and compare with baseline and a control group as measured by the self-reported questionnaires issued to children (in particular, the self-reported brushing frequency and positive responses on fluoridated toothpaste use). The enduring nature of the program will be determined by the inclusion of 8- and 24-week time points. METHODS:The study is a 2-arm superiority randomized controlled trial. Clusters in this study are infant and junior schools in Indonesia and Nigeria. The study aims to recruit 20 schools with children aged 6 to 9 years in each country. At baseline, children in both intervention and control schools will answer a questionnaire and have their clinical oral health assessed using the Simplified Oral Hygiene Index (OHI) and Decayed Missing and Filled Teeth index. Children in the intervention schools will then take part in a structured 21-day Brush Day & Night intervention. Children in the control schools will be provided with free toothpaste and toothbrushes but will not receive the 21-day intervention. The questionnaires and OHI assessments are repeated after the 21-day program is completed and again 8 weeks later and 24 weeks later for all participating children. Parents/carers/guardians of all children will sign the informed consent and complete questionnaires on their own experience and attitudes toward oral health and toothbrushing routine at each of the four times points (baseline, 21 days, 8 weeks, and 24 weeks). The study will be conducted by the national dental associations of Indonesia and Nigeria and was approved by the ethics committees of both countries. RESULTS:The study is ongoing. Recruitment of schools started in Indonesia in February 2018 and in Nigeria in April 2018 for the first part of the study, which concluded in Indonesia in September 2018 and in Nigeria in November 2018. The second part of the study (the second half of the schools) started in November 2018 in Indonesia and December 2018 in Nigeria.

31173064,RAISS: robust and accurate imputation from summary statistics.,"<h4>Motivation</h4>Multi-trait analyses using public summary statistics from genome-wide association studies (GWASs) are becoming increasingly popular. A constraint of multi-trait methods is that they require complete summary data for all traits. Although methods for the imputation of summary statistics exist, they lack precision for genetic variants with small effect size. This is benign for univariate analyses where only variants with large effect size are selected a posteriori. However, it can lead to strong p-value inflation in multi-trait testing. Here we present a new approach that improve the existing imputation methods and reach a precision suitable for multi-trait analyses.<h4>Results</h4>We fine-tuned parameters to obtain a very high accuracy imputation from summary statistics. We demonstrate this accuracy for variants of all effect sizes on real data of 28 GWAS. We implemented the resulting methodology in a python package specially designed to efficiently impute multiple GWAS in parallel.<h4>Availability and implementation</h4>The python package is available at: https://gitlab.pasteur.fr/statistical-genetics/raiss, its accompanying documentation is accessible here http://statistical-genetics.pages.pasteur.fr/raiss/.<h4>Supplementary information</h4>Supplementary data are available at Bioinformatics online.",0,

We also provide the first snapshot of P. aeruginosa strain diversity with respect to antibiotic resistance. Our approach will allow us to draw potential links between environmental strains and those implicated in human and animal infections, understand how patients become infected and how the infection evolves over time as well as identify prognostic markers for better evidence-based decisions on patient care.",,
24588959,Analysis of BRAF(V600E) mutation and DNA methylation improves the diagnostics of thyroid fine needle aspiration biopsies.,"<h4>Background</h4>Thyroid nodules with indeterminate cytological features on fine needle aspiration biopsy specimens (FNABs) have a ~20% risk of thyroid cancer. BRAF(V600E) mutation and DNA methylation are useful markers to distinguish malignant thyroid neoplasm from benign. The aim of this study was to determine whether combined detection of BRAF(V600E) mutation and methylation markers on FNABs could improve the diagnostic accuracy of thyroid cancer.<h4>Methods</h4>Using pyrosequencing and quantitative methylation-specific PCR (Q-MSP) methods, FNABs from 79 and 38 patients with thyroid nodules in training and test groups, respectively, were analyzed for BRAF(V600E) mutation and gene methylation.<h4>Results</h4>BRAF(V600E) mutation was found in 30/42 (71.4%) and 14/20 (70%) FNABs in training and test groups, respectively. All BRAF(V600E)-positive samples were histologically diagnosed as papillary thyroid cancer (PTC) after thyroidectomy. As expected, BRAF mutation was not found in all benign nodules. Moreover, we demonstrated that the five genes, including CALCA, DAPK1, TIMP3, RAR-beta and RASSF1A, were aberrantly methylated in FNABs. Of them, methylation level of DAPK1 in PTCs was significantly higher than that in benign samples (P <0.0001). Conversely, methylation level of RASSF1A in PTCs was significantly lower than that in benign samples (P =0.003). Notably, compared with BRAF mutation testing alone, combined detection of BRAF mutation and methylation markers increased the diagnostic sensitivity and accuracy of PTC with excellent specificity.<h4>Conclusion</h4>Our data have demonstrated that combine analysis of BRAF mutation and DNA methylation markers on FNABs may be a useful strategy to facilitate the diagnosis of malignant thyroid neoplasm, particularly PTC.<h4>Virtual slides</h4>The virtual slide(s) for this article can be found here: http://www.diagnosticpathology.diagnomx.eu/vs/6080878071149177.",0,

HAGR consists of six core databases: (i) the GenAge database of ageing-related genes, in turn composed of a dataset of >300 human ageing-related genes and a dataset with >2000 genes associated with ageing or longevity in model organisms; (ii) the AnAge database of animal ageing and longevity, featuring >4000 species; (iii) the GenDR database with >200 genes associated with the life-extending effects of dietary restriction; (iv) the LongevityMap database of human genetic association studies of longevity with >500 entries; (v) the DrugAge database with >400 ageing or longevity-associated drugs or compounds; (vi) the CellAge database with >200 genes associated with cell senescence. All our databases are manually curated by experts and regularly updated to ensure a high quality data. Cross-links across our databases and to external resources help researchers locate and integrate relevant information. HAGR is freely available online (http://genomics.senescence.info/).",1,

A study published in <i>mSphere</i> by Jain and colleagues (M. Jain, L. A. Fleites, and D. W. Gabriel, mSphere 2:e00171-17, 2017, https://doi.org/10.1128/mSphereDirect.00171-17) reports on an intriguing new twist of how a prophage of the bacterium ""<i>Candidatus</i> Liberibacter asiaticus"" may have its lytic cycle suppressed partly because of a protein that is expressed by a cooccurring bacterium, <i>Wolbachia</i>. Both of these microbes coexist along with other microbial tenants inside their sap-feeding insect host, a psyllid. Although these results are still preliminary and alternative hypotheses need to be tested, these results suggest an interesting new dimension on how regulation of microbial genomes occurs in a community context.",0,
31161212,RNA-align: quick and accurate alignment of RNA 3D structures based on size-independent TM-scoreRNA.,"<h4>Motivation</h4>Comparison of RNA 3D structures can be used to infer functional relationship of RNA molecules. Most of the current RNA structure alignment programs are built on size-dependent scales, which complicate the interpretation of structure and functional relations. Meanwhile, the low speed prevents the programs from being applied to large-scale RNA structural database search.<h4>Results</h4>We developed an open-source algorithm, RNA-align, for RNA 3D structure alignment which has the structure similarity scaled by a size-independent and statistically interpretable scoring metric. Large-scale benchmark tests show that RNA-align significantly outperforms other state-of-the-art programs in both alignment accuracy and running speed. The major advantage of RNA-align lies at the quick convergence of the heuristic alignment iterations and the coarse-grained secondary structure assignment, both of which are crucial to the speed and accuracy of RNA structure alignments.<h4>Availability and implementation</h4>https://zhanglab.ccmb.med.umich.edu/RNA-align/.<h4>Supplementary information</h4>Supplementary data are available at Bioinformatics online.",0,

31179198,An Emergent Space for Distributed Data with Hidden Internal Order through Manifold Learning.,"Manifold-learning techniques are routinely used in mining complex spatiotemporal data to extract useful, parsimonious data representations/parametrizations; these are, in turn, useful in nonlinear model identification tasks. We focus here on the case of time series data that can ultimately be modelled as a spatially distributed system (e.g. a partial differential equation, PDE), but where we do not know the space in which this PDE should be formulated. Hence, even the spatial coordinates for the distributed system themselves need to be identified - to ""emerge from""-the data mining process. We will first validate this ""emergent space"" reconstruction for time series sampled <i>without space labels</i> in known PDEs; this brings up the issue of observability of physical space from temporal observation data, and the transition from spatially resolved to lumped (order-parameter-based) representations by tuning the scale of the data mining kernels. We will then present actual emergent space ""discovery"" illustrations. Our illustrative examples include chimera states (states of coexisting coherent and incoherent dynamics), and chaotic as well as quasiperiodic spatiotemporal dynamics, arising in partial differential equations and/or in heterogeneous networks. We also discuss how data-driven ""spatial"" coordinates can be extracted in ways invariant to the nature of the measuring instrument. Such gauge-invariant data mining can go beyond the fusion of heterogeneous observations of the same system, to the possible matching of apparently different systems.

33675341,Maternal BMI is positively associated with human milk fat: a systematic review and meta-regression analysis.,"<h4>Background</h4>Lack of robust estimates of human-milk nutrient composition and influential maternal factors, such as body composition, are barriers to informing nutrition policies and programs.<h4>Objective</h4>The objective was to understand the relation between maternal BMI and human-milk energy, fat, and/or total protein.<h4>Methods</h4>Four electronic databases (MEDLINE, Embase, CINAHL, and Web of Science) were searched. Outcomes assessed were human-milk energy (kcal/L), fat (g/L), and total protein (g/L) from mothers 1 to 6 mo postpartum. Studies with data on maternal BMI or weight and height that quantified human-milk energy, fat, or protein between 1 and 6 mo postpartum were eligible. Random-effects meta-regression weighted by the inverse of the study-level SE was completed for each of the 3 outcomes. The certainty of evidence for each outcome was assessed using the GRADE (Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development, and Evaluation) approach.<h4>Results</h4>A total of 11,373 titles and abstracts were identified, and after full-text screening, 69 articles of 66 studies were included. Meta-regression results showed a positive association between maternal BMI and human-milk fat (ﬂ: 0.56 g/L; 95% CI: 0.034, 1.1; P = 0.04; I2 = 93.7%, n = 63 datapoints). There was no significant association between maternal BMI and human-milk energy (ﬂ: 3.9 kcal/L; 95% CI: -1.6, 9.5; P = 0.16, I2 = 93.3%, n = 40 datapoints) or total protein (ﬂ: 0.13 g/L; 95% CI: -0.16, 0.41; P = 0.37, I2 = 99.1%, n = 40 datapoints). The certainty of evidence for human-milk energy was low and the certainty of evidence for fat and total protein was very low.<h4>Conclusions</h4>Meta-regression analysis of available literature suggested an association between maternal BMI and human-milk fat between 1 and 6 mo postpartum. Future studies are needed to confirm the relation between maternal BMI; variation in human-milk energy, fat, and protein content; and the implications for child growth and development.

26098815,From Ramachandran Maps to Tertiary Structures of Proteins.,"Sequence to structure of proteins is an unsolved problem. A possible coarse grained resolution to this entails specification of all the torsional (F, <U+03A8>) angles along the backbone of the polypeptide chain. The Ramachandran map quite elegantly depicts the allowed conformational (F, <U+03A8>) space of proteins which is still very large for the purposes of accurate structure generation. We have divided the allowed (F, <U+03A8>) space in Ramachandran maps into 27 distinct conformations sufficient to regenerate a structure to within 5 ≈ from the native, at least for small proteins, thus reducing the structure prediction problem to a specification of an alphanumeric string, i.e., the amino acid sequence together with one of the 27 conformations preferred by each amino acid residue. This still theoretically results in 27(n) conformations for a protein comprising ""n"" amino acids. We then investigated the spatial correlations at the two-residue (dipeptide) and three-residue (tripeptide) levels in what may be described as higher order Ramachandran maps, with the premise that the allowed conformational space starts to shrink as we introduce neighborhood effects. We found, for instance, for a tripeptide which potentially can exist in any of the 27(3) ""allowed"" conformations, three-fourths of these conformations are redundant to the 95% confidence level, suggesting sequence context dependent preferred conformations. We then created a look-up table of preferred conformations at the tripeptide level and correlated them with energetically favorable conformations. We found in particular that Boltzmann probabilities calculated from van der Waals energies for each conformation of tripeptides correlate well with the observed populations in the structural database (the average correlation coefficient is ~0.8). An alpha-numeric string and hence the tertiary structure can be generated for any sequence from the look-up table within minutes on a single processor and to a higher level of accuracy if secondary structure can be specified. We tested the methodology on 100 small proteins, and in 90% of the cases, a structure within 5 ≈ is recovered. We thus believe that the method presented here provides the missing link between Ramachandran maps and tertiary structures of proteins. A Web server to convert a tertiary structure to an alphanumeric string and to predict the tertiary structure from the sequence of a protein using the above methodology is created and made freely accessible at http://www.scfbio-iitd.res.in/software/proteomics/rm2ts.jsp.",,

Generalized Born (GB) models offer a fast and convenient computational approximation over other implicit solvent-based electrostatic models. Here we present a novel GB-based web server, using the program Bluues, to calculate numerous electrostatic features including pKa-values and surface potentials. The output is organized allowing both experts and beginners to rapidly sift the data. A novel feature of the Bluues server is that it explicitly allows to find electrostatic differences between wild-type and mutant structures.<h4>Availability</h4>The Bluues server, examples and extensive help files are available for non-commercial use at URL: http://protein.bio.unipd.it/bluues/.",0,
33768769,Prognostic factors in postoperative radiotherapy for prostate cancer - tertiary center experience.,"<h4>Background</h4>The aim of the study was to analyse the prognostic factors in postoperative prostate cancer irradiation and develop a nomogram for disease-free survival (DFS).<h4>Patients and methods</h4>This retrospective study included 236 consecutive prostate cancer patients who had radical prostatectomy followed by radiotherapy (RT) at a single tertiary institution between 2009 and 2014. The main outcome was DFS analysed through uni- and multivariable analysis, Kaplan-Meier curves, log-rank testing, recursive partitioning analysis, and nomogram development.<h4>Results</h4>The median follow up was 62.3 (interquartile range [IQR] 38.1-79) months. The independent clinical factors associated with increased risk of recurrence or progression in the multivariate analysis (MVA) were prostate-specific antigen (PSA) level before RT, pT3 characteristic, and local failure as salvage indication. The value of PSA nadir had a significant impact on the risk of biochemical failure. Biochemical control and DFS were significantly different depending on treatment indication (p < 0.0001). The recursive partitioning analysis highlighted the importance of the PSA level before RT, Gleason Grade Group, PSA nadir, and local failure as a treatment indication. Finally, the nomogram for DFS was developed and is available online at https://apps.konsta.com.pl/app/prostate-salvage-dfs/.<h4>Conclusions</h4>The Pre-RT PSA level, pT3 characteristic and local failure as salvage indication are pivotal prognostic factors associated with increased risk of recurrence or progression. The Gleason grade group of 4-5 and PSA nadir value allow for further risk stratification. The treatment outcomes in postoperative prostate cancer irradiation are significantly different depending on treatment indication. An online nomogram comprising of both pre-treatment and current data was developed allowing for visualization of changes in prognosis depending on clinical data.",0,
25022716,Impact of prophylactic central neck dissection on oncologic outcomes of papillary thyroid carcinoma: a review.,"Prophylactic neck dissection (PND) for papillary thyroid carcinoma (PTC) is controversial. Our aim was to assess current levels of evidence (LE) according to the Oxford Centre for Evidence-based Medicine ( http://www.cebm.net/?O=1025 ) regarding the oncologic benefits of PND. Data were analyzed via MEDLINE keywords: PTC, differentiated thyroid carcinoma, PND, central lymph node metastases, central compartment, recurrence-free survival. There was conflicting evidence regarding the rate of reoperation for recurrence, with some studies showing a lower rate after PND with increased recurrence-free survival and a higher rate of undetectable pre- and post-ablation thyroglobulin levels (LE 4), whereas other studies did not show a difference (LE 4). Only one study (LE 4) showed improved disease-specific survival with PND. PND may improve recurrence-free survival, although this is supported by only a low LE. Current recommendations can only be based on low-level evidence.",0,

28633399,The interfacial character of antibody paratopes: analysis of antibody-antigen structures.,"<h4>Summary</h4>In this study, computational methods are applied to investigate the general properties of antigen engaging residues of a paratope from a non-redundant dataset of 403 antibody-antigen complexes to dissect the contribution of hydrogen bonds, hydrophobic, van der Waals contacts and ionic interactions, as well as role of water molecules in the antigen-antibody interface. Consistent with previous reports using smaller datasets, we found that Tyr, Trp, Ser, Asn, Asp, Thr, Arg, Gly, His contribute substantially to the interactions between antibody and antigen. Furthermore, antibody-antigen interactions can be mediated by interfacial waters. However, there is no reported comprehensive analysis for a large number of structured waters that engage in higher ordered structures at the antibody-antigen interface. From our dataset, we have found the presence of interfacial waters in 242 complexes. We present evidence that suggests a compelling role of these interfacial waters in interactions of antibodies with a range of antigens differing in shape complementarity. Finally, we carry out 296 835 pairwise 3D structure comparisons of 771 structures of contact residues of antibodies with their interfacial water molecules from our dataset using CLICK method. A heuristic clustering algorithm is used to obtain unique structural similarities, and found to separate into 368 different clusters. These clusters are used to identify structural motifs of contact residues of antibodies for epitope binding.<h4>Availability and implementation</h4>This clustering database of contact residues is freely accessible at http://mspc.bii.a-star.edu.sg/minhn/pclick.html.<h4>Contact</h4>minhn@bii.a-star.edu.sg, chandra@bii.a-star.edu.sg or zhong_pingyu@immunol.a-star.edu.sg.<h4>Supplementary information</h4>Supplementary data are available at Bioinformatics online.",1,

25344501,iDoComp: a compression scheme for assembled genomes.,"<h4>Motivation</h4>With the release of the latest next-generation sequencing (NGS) machine, the HiSeq X by Illumina, the cost of sequencing a Human has dropped to a mere $4000. Thus we are approaching a milestone in the sequencing history, known as the $1000 genome era, where the sequencing of individuals is affordable, opening the doors to effective personalized medicine. Massive generation of genomic data, including assembled genomes, is expected in the following years. There is crucial need for compression of genomes guaranteed of performing well simultaneously on different species, from simple bacteria to humans, which will ease their transmission, dissemination and analysis. Further, most of the new genomes to be compressed will correspond to individuals of a species from which a reference already exists on the database. Thus, it is natural to propose compression schemes that assume and exploit the availability of such references.<h4>Results</h4>We propose iDoComp, a compressor of assembled genomes presented in FASTA format that compresses an individual genome using a reference genome for both the compression and the decompression. In terms of compression efficiency, iDoComp outperforms previously proposed algorithms in most of the studied cases, with comparable or better running time. For example, we observe compression gains of up to 60% in several cases, including H.sapiens data, when comparing with the best compression performance among the previously proposed algorithms.<h4>Availability</h4>iDoComp is written in C and can be downloaded from: http://www.stanford.edu/~iochoa/iDoComp.html (We also provide a full explanation on how to run the program and an example with all the necessary files to run it.).",0,
28530006,Kindergarten/Elementary School Teachers and Web-based Oral Health-Related Resources: An Exploration.,"<h4>Purpose</h4>The percentage of U.S. children with poor oral health continues to be high. Kindergarten/elementary school educators could play an important role in teaching students about oral health promotion. The objectives were to assess which oral health-related web-based resources teachers consider most helpful and how teachers' attitudes, knowledge, and behavioural intentions concerning oral health-related teaching change between before and after having access to a resource website.<h4>Materials and methods</h4>Web-based survey data were collected from 95 kindergarten/elementary school educators before and after they accessed a website with oral health-related information for teachers (web-link: http://media.dent.umich.edu/teachoralhealth/index.html).<h4>Results</h4>Most teachers accessed lesson plans about 'Teeth and smiling' (90%) and 'Taking care of your teeth' (88%) and the fewest accessed information about 'Nutrition and health' (42%) and 'Information for parents' (39%). On average, all materials were perceived as useful (5-point scale with 5†=†'very useful', range†=†3.80 to 4.04). Responses to the question on how important dental health is for a child's ability to learn improved significantly from before to after the educational intervention (5-point scale with 5†=†'very important', 3.78 vs 4.44). Knowledge increased and behavioural intentions improved as well. The percentage of teachers who reported that they had included oral health-related material in the past was 47% and the percentage who intended to include it in the future was 65% (p†<†0.001).<h4>Conclusions</h4>Providing kindergarten/elementary school educators with web-based resource materials improves their attitudes, increases their knowledge and leads to positive behavioural intentions concerning educating their students about oral health.",0,
26464967,neuTube 1.0: A New Design for Efficient Neuron Reconstruction Software Based on the SWC Format.,"Brain circuit mapping requires digital reconstruction of neuronal morphologies in complicated networks. Despite recent advances in automatic algorithms, reconstruction of neuronal structures is still a bottleneck in circuit mapping due to a lack of appropriate software for both efficient reconstruction and user-friendly editing.

28090394,GExplore 1.4: An expanded web interface for queries on <i>Caenorhabditis elegans</i> protein and gene function.,"Genetic high-throughput experiments often result in hundreds or thousands of genes satisfying certain experimental conditions. Grouping and prioritizing a large number of genes for further analysis can be a time-consuming challenge. In 2009 we developed a web-based user interface, GExplore, to assist with large-scale data-mining related to gene function in <i>Caenorhabditis elegans</i>. The underlying database contained information about <i>Caenorhabditis elegans</i> genes and proteins including domain organization of the proteins, phenotypic descriptions, expression data and Gene Ontology Consortium annotations. These data enable users to quickly obtain an overview of biological and biochemical functions of a large number of genes at once. Since its inception the underlying database has been updated and expanded significantly. Here we describe the current version of GExplore 1.4, documenting the changes since the original release. GExplore 1.4 now contains information about the domain organization of the proteomes of 9 nematode species, can display the location of <i>Caenorhabditis elegans</i> mutations with respect to the domain organization of the proteins, and includes stage-specific RNAseq gene expression data generated by the modENCODE project.

23829391,An untargeted metabolomic workflow to improve structural characterization of metabolites.,"Mass spectrometry-based metabolomics relies on MS(2) data for structural characterization of metabolites. To obtain the high-quality MS(2) data necessary to support metabolite identifications, ions of interest must be purely isolated for fragmentation. Here, we show that metabolomic MS(2) data are frequently characterized by contaminating ions that prevent structural identification. Although using narrow-isolation windows can minimize contaminating MS(2) fragments, even narrow windows are not always selective enough, and they can complicate data analysis by removing isotopic patterns from MS(2) spectra. Moreover, narrow windows can significantly reduce sensitivity. In this work, we introduce a novel, two-part approach for performing metabolomic identifications that addresses these issues. First, we collect MS(2) scans with less stringent isolation settings to obtain improved sensitivity at the expense of specificity. Then, by evaluating MS(2) fragment intensities as a function of retention time and precursor mass targeted for MS(2) analysis, we obtain deconvolved MS(2) spectra that are consistent with pure standards and can therefore be used for metabolite identification. The value of our approach is highlighted with metabolic extracts from brain, liver, astrocytes, as well as nerve tissue, and performance is evaluated by using pure metabolite standards in combination with simulations based on raw MS(2) data from the METLIN metabolite database. A R package implementing the algorithms used in our workflow is available on our laboratory website ( http://pattilab.wustl.edu/decoms2.php ).",0,
32986461,Correction to Bagby et al. (2020).,"Reports an error in ""Examining the ""traditional background hypothesis"" for the MMPI-2-RF L-r scores in a Muslim faith-based sample"" by R. Michael Bagby, Karin A. Onno, Ardeshir Mortezaei and Martin Sellbom (<i>Psychological Assessment</i>, Advanced Online Publication, Jul 27, 2020, np). In the article ""Examining the 'Traditional Background Hypothesis' for the MMPI-2-RF L-r Scores in a Muslim Faith-Based Sample,"" by R. Michael Bagby, Karin A. Onno, Ardeshir Mortezaei, and Martin Sellbom (Psychological Assessment, 2020, Vol. 32, No. 10, pp. 991-995, http://dx.doi.org/ 10.1037/pas0000941), the word ""not"" was missing in the abstract from the text ""(b) direct assessments of strength of faith or positive impression management were included or measured independently."" The correct sentence should have read as follows: ""(b) direct assessments of strength of faith or positive impression management were not included or measured independently."" All versions of this article have been corrected. (The following abstract of the original article appeared in record 2020-54974-001.) The traditional background hypothesis (TBH) is a long-standing belief associated with the Minnesota Multiphasic Personality Inventory (MMPI) L scale; a validity scale, which appears on every version of the family of MMPI instruments including the soon-to-be released MMPI-3. The L scale was originally designed to assess whether test respondents presented themselves in an unrealistically favorable light. Both researchers and clinicians noted, however, that those from traditional Christian faith-based groups produced elevated L-scale scores. A recent meta-analysis supported this observation, reporting an average L-scale elevation 0.50 SD greater than the MMPI-2 normative sample compared to samples of those with presumptively strong Christian-Judeo faith. Some limitations of this meta-analysis are that (a) the samples used in it included those undergoing an evaluative assessment, which could elevate L-scale scores independent of strength of faith belief, and (b) direct assessments of strength of faith or positive impression management were included or measured independently. Our primary goal in this study was to examine the TBH addressing these limitations with a sample of those who self-identified as believers in the Muslim faith (N = 267), the examination of which expands the scope beyond those of the Christian-Judeo faith. Consistent with previous results, the mean L-r (MMPI/MMPI-2 L scale counterpart on the MMPI-2-Restructured Form) was 56.41 T. Higher L-r scale scores were associated with increasing strength in the Muslim faith, and although increasing L-r scores were primarily associated with impression management, increasing Muslim-based faith values had a nontrivial influence on L-r scores and especially in the moderate score range of this scale.

32881514,Robust Accurate Identification and Biomass Estimates of Microorganisms via Tandem Mass Spectrometry.,"Rapid and accurate identification of microorganisms and estimation of their biomasses are of extreme importance to public health. Mass spectrometry has become an important technique for these purposes. Previously we published a workflow named <i>Mi</i>croorganism <i>C</i>lassification and <i>Id</i>entification (MiCId v.12.26.2017) that was shown to perform no worse than other workflows. This manuscript presents MiCId v.12.13.2018 that, in comparison with the earlier version v.12.26.2017, allows for biomass estimates, provides more accurate microorganism identifications (better controls the number of false positives), and is robust against database size increase. This significant advance is made possible by several new ingredients introduced: first, we apply a modified expectation-maximization method to compute for each taxon considered a prior probability, which can be used for biomass estimate; second, we introduce a new concept called ownership, through which the participation ratio is computed and use it as the number of taxa to be kept within a cluster of closely related taxa; third, based on confidently identified peptides, we calculate for each taxon its degree of independence from the rest of taxa considered to determine whether or not to split this taxon off the cluster. Using 270 data files, each containing a large number of MS/MS spectra, we show that, in comparison with v.12.26.2017, version v.12.13.2018 yields superior retrieval results. We also show that MiCId v.12.13.2018 can estimate species biomass reasonably well. The new MiCId v.12.13.2018, designed to run in Linux environment, is freely available for download at https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/CBBresearch/Yu/downloads.html.",0,
33983910,"Surveillance of Vaccination Coverage Among Adult Populations -United States, 2018.","<h4>Problem/condition</h4>Adults are at risk for illness, hospitalization, disability and, in some cases, death from vaccine-preventable diseases, particularly influenza and pneumococcal disease. CDC recommends vaccinations for adults on the basis of age, health conditions, prior vaccinations, and other considerations. Updated vaccination recommendations from CDC are published annually in the U.S. Adult Immunization Schedule. Despite longstanding recommendations for use of many vaccines, vaccination coverage among U.S. adults remains low.<h4>Reporting period</h4>August 2017-June 2018 (for influenza vaccination) and January-December 2018 (for pneumococcal, herpes zoster, tetanus and diphtheria [Td]/tetanus toxoid, reduced diphtheria toxoid, and acellular pertussis [Tdap], hepatitis A, hepatitis B, and human papillomavirus [HPV] vaccination).<h4>Description of system</h4>The National Health Interview Survey (NHIS) is a continuous, cross-sectional national household survey of the noninstitutionalized U.S. civilian population. In-person interviews are conducted throughout the year in a probability sample of households, and NHIS data are compiled and released annually. NHIS's objective is to monitor the health of the U.S. population and provide estimates of health indicators, health care use and access, and health-related behaviors. Adult receipt of influenza, pneumococcal, herpes zoster, Td/Tdap, hepatitis A, hepatitis B, and at least 1 dose of HPV vaccines was assessed. Estimates were derived for a new composite adult vaccination quality measure and by selected demographic and access-to-care characteristics (e.g., age, race/ethnicity, indication for vaccination, travel history [travel to countries where hepatitis infections are endemic], health insurance status, contacts with physicians, nativity, and citizenship). Trends in adult vaccination were assessed during 2010-2018.<h4>Results</h4>Coverage for the adult age-appropriate composite measure was low in all age groups. Racial and ethnic differences in coverage persisted for all vaccinations, with lower coverage for most vaccinations among non-White compared with non-Hispanic White adults. Linear trend tests indicated coverage increased from 2010 to 2018 for most vaccines in this report. Few adults aged =19 years had received all age-appropriate vaccines, including influenza vaccination, regardless of whether inclusion of Tdap (13.5%) or inclusion of any tetanus toxoid-containing vaccine (20.2%) receipt was measured. Coverage among adults for influenza vaccination during the 2017-18 season (46.1%) was similar to the estimate for the 2016-17 season (45.4%), and coverage for pneumococcal (adults aged =65 years [69.0%]), herpes zoster (adults aged =50 years and aged =60 years [24.1% and 34.5%, respectively]), tetanus (adults aged =19 years [62.9%]), Tdap (adults aged =19 years [31.2%]), hepatitis A (adults aged =19 years [11.9%]), and HPV (females aged 19-26 years [52.8%]) vaccination in 2018 were similar to the estimates for 2017. Hepatitis B vaccination coverage among adults aged =19 years and health care personnel (HCP) aged =19 years increased 4.2 and 6.7 percentage points to 30.0% and 67.2%, respectively, from 2017. HPV vaccination coverage among males aged 19-26 years increased 5.2 percentage points to 26.3% from the 2017 estimate. Overall, HPV vaccination coverage among females aged 19-26 years did not increase, but coverage among Hispanic females aged 19-26 years increased 10.8 percentage points to 49.6% from the 2017 estimate. Coverage for the following vaccines was lower among adults without health insurance compared with those with health insurance: influenza vaccine (among adults aged =19 years, 19-49 years, and 50-64 years), pneumococcal vaccine (among adults aged 19-64 years at increased risk), Td vaccine (among all age groups), Tdap vaccine (among adults aged =19 years and 19-64 years), hepatitis A vaccine (among adults aged =19 years overall and among travelers aged =19 years), hepatitis B vaccine (among adults aged =19 years and 19-49 years and among travelers aged =19 years), herpes zoster vaccine (among adults aged =60 years), and HPV vaccine (among males and females aged 19-26 years). Adults who reported having a usual place for health care generally reported receipt of recommended vaccinations more often than those who did not have such a place, regardless of whether they had health insurance. Vaccination coverage was higher among adults reporting =1 physician contact during the preceding year compared with those who had not visited a physician during the preceding year, regardless of whether they had health insurance. Even among adults who had health insurance and =10 physician contacts during the preceding year, depending on the vaccine, 20.1%-87.5% reported not having received vaccinations that were recommended either for all persons or for those with specific indications. Overall, vaccination coverage among U.S.-born adults was significantly higher than that of foreign-born adults, including influenza vaccination (aged =19 years), pneumococcal vaccination (all ages), tetanus vaccination (all ages), Tdap vaccination (all ages), hepatitis B vaccination (aged =19 years and 19-49 years and travelers aged =19 years), herpes zoster vaccination (all ages), and HPV vaccination among females aged 19-26 years. Vaccination coverage also varied by citizenship status and years living in the United States.<h4>Interpretation</h4>NHIS data indicate that many adults remain unprotected against vaccine-preventable diseases. Coverage for the adult age-appropriate composite measures was low in all age groups. Individual adult vaccination coverage remained low as well, but modest gains occurred in vaccination coverage for hepatitis B (among adults aged =19 years and HCP aged =19 years), and HPV (among males aged 19-26 years and Hispanic females aged 19-26 years). Coverage for other vaccines and groups with Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices vaccination indications did not improve from 2017. Although HPV vaccination coverage among males aged 19-26 years and Hispanic females aged 19-26 years increased, approximately 50% of females aged 19-26 years and 70% of males aged 19-26 years remained unvaccinated. Racial/ethnic vaccination differences persisted for routinely recommended adult vaccines. Having health insurance coverage, having a usual place for health care, and having =1 physician contacts during the preceding 12 months were associated with higher vaccination coverage; however, these factors alone were not associated with optimal adult vaccination coverage, and findings indicate missed opportunities to vaccinate remained.<h4>Public health actions</h4>Substantial improvement in adult vaccination uptake is needed to reduce the burden of vaccine-preventable diseases. Following the Standards for Adult Immunization Practice (https://www.cdc.gov/vaccines/hcp/adults/for-practice/standards/index.html), all providers should routinely assess adults' vaccination status at every clinical encounter, strongly recommend appropriate vaccines, either offer needed vaccines or refer their patients to another provider who can administer the needed vaccines, and document vaccinations received by their patients in an immunization information system.",0,
26677962,CG2AA: backmapping protein coarse-grained structures.,"<h4>Unlabelled</h4>Coarse grain (CG) models allow long-scale simulations with a much lower computational cost than that of all-atom simulations. However, the absence of atomistic detail impedes the analysis of specific atomic interactions that are determinant in most interesting biomolecular processes. In order to study these phenomena, it is necessary to reconstruct the atomistic structure from the CG representation. This structure can be analyzed by itself or be used as an onset for atomistic molecular dynamics simulations. In this work, we present a computer program that accurately reconstructs the atomistic structure from a CG model for proteins, using a simple geometrical algorithm.<h4>Availability and implementation</h4>The software is free and available online at http://www.ic.fcen.uba.ar/cg2aa/cg2aa.py<h4>Supplementary information</h4>Supplementary data are available at Bioinformatics online.<h4>Contact</h4>lula@qi.fcen.uba.ar.",0,
29043042,feedr and animalnexus.ca: A paired R package and user-friendly Web application for transforming and visualizing animal movement data from static stations.,"Radio frequency identification (RFID) provides a simple and inexpensive approach for examining the movements of tagged animals, which can provide information on species behavior and ecology, such as habitat/resource use and social interactions. In addition, tracking animal movements is appealing to naturalists, citizen scientists, and the general public and thus represents a tool for public engagement in science and science education. Although a useful tool, the large amount of data collected using RFID may quickly become overwhelming. Here, we present an R package (feedr) we have developed for loading, transforming, and visualizing time-stamped, georeferenced data, such as RFID data collected from static logger stations. Using our package, data can be transformed from raw RFID data to visits, presence (regular detections by a logger over time), movements between loggers, displacements, and activity patterns. In addition, we provide several conversion functions to allow users to format data for use in functions from other complementary R packages. Data can also be visualized through static or interactive maps or as animations over time. To increase accessibility, data can be transformed and visualized either through R directly, or through the companion site: http://animalnexus.ca, an online, user-friendly, R-based Shiny Web application. This system can be used by professional and citizen scientists alike to view and study animal movements. We have designed this package to be flexible and to be able to handle data collected from other stationary sources (e.g., hair traps, static very high frequency (VHF) telemetry loggers, observations of marked individuals in colonies or staging sites), and we hope this framework will become a meeting point for science, education, and community awareness of the movements of animals. We aim to inspire citizen engagement while simultaneously enabling robust scientific analysis.",0,
29280994,PRAPI: post-transcriptional regulation analysis pipeline for Iso-Seq.,"<h4>Summary</h4>The single-molecule real-time (SMRT) isoform sequencing (Iso-Seq) based on Pacific Bioscience (PacBio) platform has received increasing attention for its ability to explore full-length isoforms. Thus, comprehensive tools for Iso-Seq bioinformatics analysis are extremely useful. Here, we present a one-stop solution for Iso-Seq analysis, called PRAPI to analyze alternative transcription initiation (ATI), alternative splicing (AS), alternative cleavage and polyadenylation (APA), natural antisense transcripts (NAT), and circular RNAs (circRNAs) comprehensively. PRAPI is capable of combining Iso-Seq full-length isoforms with short read data, such as RNA-Seq or polyadenylation site sequencing (PAS-seq) for differential expression analysis of NAT, AS, APA and circRNAs. Furthermore, PRAPI can annotate new genes and correct mis-annotated genes when gene annotation is available. Finally, PRAPI generates high-quality vector graphics to visualize and highlight the Iso-Seq results.<h4>Availability and implementation</h4>The Dockerfile of PRAPI is available at http://www.bioinfor.org/tool/PRAPI.<h4>Contact</h4>lfgu@fafu.edu.cn.",0,
23637070,glyXalign: high-throughput migration time alignment preprocessing of electrophoretic data retrieved via multiplexed capillary gel electrophoresis with laser-induced fluorescence detection-based glycoprofiling.,"Glycomics has become a rapidly emerging field and monitoring of protein glycosylation is needed to ensure quality and consistency during production processes of biologicals such as therapeutic antibodies or vaccines. Glycoanalysis via multiplexed CGE with LIF detection (xCGE-LIF) represents a powerful technique featuring high resolution, high sensitivity as well as high-throughput performance. However, sample data retrieved from this method exhibit challenges for downstream computational analysis due to intersample migration time shifts as well as stretching and compression of electropherograms. Here, we present glyXalign, a freely available and easy-to-use software package to automatically correct for distortions in xCGE-LIF based glycan data. We demonstrate its ability to outperform conventional algorithms such as dynamic time warping and correlation optimized warping in terms of processing time and alignment accuracy for high-resolution datasets. Built upon a set of rapid algorithms, the tool includes an intuitive graphical user interface and allows full control over all parameters. Additionally, it visualizes the alignment process and enables the user to readjust misaligned results. Software and documentation are available at http://www.glyxera.com.",0,
24312116,The power of regional heritability analysis for rare and common variant detection: simulations and application to eye biometrical traits.,"Genome-wide association studies (GWAS) have provided valuable insights into the genetic basis of complex traits. However, they have explained relatively little trait heritability. Recently, we proposed a new analytical approach called regional heritability mapping (RHM) that captures more of the missing genetic variation. This method is applicable both to related and unrelated populations. Here, we demonstrate the power of RHM in comparison with single-SNP GWAS and gene-based association approaches under a wide range of scenarios with variable numbers of quantitative trait loci (QTL) with common and rare causal variants in a narrow genomic region. Simulations based on real genotype data were performed to assess power to capture QTL variance, and we demonstrate that RHM has greater power to detect rare variants and/or multiple alleles in a region than other approaches. In addition, we show that RHM can capture more accurately the QTL variance, when it is caused by multiple independent effects and/or rare variants. We applied RHM to analyze three biometrical eye traits for which single-SNP GWAS have been published or performed to evaluate the effectiveness of this method in real data analysis and detected some additional loci which were not detected by other GWAS methods. RHM has the potential to explain some of missing heritability by capturing variance caused by QTL with low MAF and multiple independent QTL in a region, not captured by other GWAS methods. RHM analyses can be implemented using the software REACTA (http://www.epcc.ed.ac.uk/projects-portfolio/reacta).",0,

IDEAL contains manual annotations by curators on intrinsically disordered regions, interaction regions to other molecules, post-translational modification sites, references and structural domain assignments. In particular, IDEAL explicitly describes protean segments that can be transformed from a disordered state to an ordered state.

22303397,Accurate microRNA Target Prediction Using Detailed Binding Site Accessibility and Machine Learning on Proteomics Data.,"MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are a class of small regulatory genes regulating gene expression by targeting messenger RNA. Though computational methods for miRNA target prediction are the prevailing means to analyze their function, they still miss a large fraction of the targeted genes and additionally predict a large number of false positives. Here we introduce a novel algorithm called DIANA-microT-ANN which combines multiple novel target site features through an artificial neural network (ANN) and is trained using recently published high-throughput data measuring the change of protein levels after miRNA overexpression, providing positive and negative targeting examples. The features characterizing each miRNA recognition element include binding structure, conservation level, and a specific profile of structural accessibility. The ANN is trained to integrate the features of each recognition element along the 3'untranslated region into a targeting score, reproducing the relative repression fold change of the protein. Tested on two different sets the algorithm outperforms other widely used algorithms and also predicts a significant number of unique and reliable targets not predicted by the other methods. For 542 human miRNAs DIANA-microT-ANN predicts 120000 targets not provided by TargetScan 5.0. The algorithm is freely available at http://microrna.gr/microT-ANN.",0,
34177338,MassBase: A large-scaled depository of mass spectrometry datasets for metabolome analysis.,"Depository of low-molecular-weight compounds or metabolites detected in various organisms in a non-targeted manner is indispensable for metabolomics research. Due to the diverse chemical compounds, various mass spectrometry (MS) setups with state-of-the-art technologies have been used. Over the past two decades, we have analyzed various biological samples by using gas chromatography-mass spectrometry, liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry, or capillary electrophoresis-mass spectrometry, and archived the datasets in the depository MassBase (http://webs2.kazusa.or.jp/massbase/). As the format of MS datasets depends on the MS setup used, we converted each raw binary dataset of the mass chromatogram to text file format, and thereafter, information of the chromatograph peak was extracted in the text file from the converted file. In total, the depository comprises 46,493 datasets, of which 38,750 belong to the plant species and 7,743 are authentic or mixed chemicals as well as other sources (microorganisms, animals, and foods), as on August 1, 2020. All files in the depository can be downloaded in bulk from the website. Mass chromatograms of 90 plant species obtained by LC-Fourier transform ion cyclotron resonance MS or Orbitrap MS, which detect the ionized molecules with high accuracy allowing speculation of chemical compositions, were converted to text files by the software PowerGet, and the chemical annotation of each peak was added. The processed datasets were deposited in the annotation database KomicMarket2 (http://webs2.kazusa.or.jp/km2/). The archives provide fundamental resources for comparative metabolomics and functional genomics, which may result in deeper understanding of living organisms.",1,
21554765,Enhancing genome assemblies by integrating non-sequence based data.,"<h4>Introduction</h4>Many genome projects were underway before the advent of high-throughput sequencing and have thus been supported by a wealth of genome information from other technologies. Such information frequently takes the form of linkage and physical maps, both of which can provide a substantial amount of data useful in de novo sequencing projects. Furthermore, the recent abundance of genome resources enables the use of conserved synteny maps identified in related species to further enhance genome assemblies.<h4>Methods</h4>The tammar wallaby (Macropus eugenii) is a model marsupial mammal with a low coverage genome. However, we have access to extensive comparative maps containing over 14,000 markers constructed through the physical mapping of conserved loci, chromosome painting and comprehensive linkage maps. Using a custom Bioperl pipeline, information from the maps was aligned to assembled tammar wallaby contigs using BLAT. This data was used to construct pseudo paired-end libraries with intervals ranging from 5-10 MB. We then used Bambus (a program designed to scaffold eukaryotic genomes by ordering and orienting contigs through the use of paired-end data) to scaffold our libraries. To determine how map data compares to sequence based approaches to enhance assemblies, we repeated the experiment using a 0.5◊ coverage of unique reads from 4 KB and 8 KB Illumina paired-end libraries. Finally, we combined both the sequence and non-sequence-based data to determine how a combined approach could further enhance the quality of the low coverage de novo reconstruction of the tammar wallaby genome.<h4>Results</h4>Using the map data alone, we were able order 2.2% of the initial contigs into scaffolds, and increase the N50 scaffold size to 39 KB (36 KB in the original assembly). Using only the 0.5◊ paired-end sequence based data, 53% of the initial contigs were assigned to scaffolds. Combining both data sets resulted in a further 2% increase in the number of initial contigs integrated into a scaffold (55% total) but a 35% increase in N50 scaffold size over the use of sequence-based data alone.<h4>Conclusions</h4>We provide a relatively simple pipeline utilizing existing bioinformatics tools to integrate map data into a genome assembly which is available at http://www.mcb.uconn.edu/fac.php?name=paska. While the map data only contributed minimally to assigning the initial contigs to scaffolds in the new assembly, it greatly increased the N50 size. This process added structure to our low coverage assembly, greatly increasing its utility in further analyses.",0,
21873327,Finding recurrent copy number alterations preserving within-sample homogeneity.,"<h4>Motivation</h4>Copy number alterations (CNAs) represent an important component of genetic variation and play a significant role in many human diseases. Development of array comparative genomic hybridization (aCGH) technology has made it possible to identify CNAs. Identification of recurrent CNAs represents the first fundamental step to provide a list of genomic regions which form the basis for further biological investigations. The main problem in recurrent CNAs discovery is related to the need to distinguish between functional changes and random events without pathological relevance. Within-sample homogeneity represents a common feature of copy number profile in cancer, so it can be used as additional source of information to increase the accuracy of the results. Although several algorithms aimed at the identification of recurrent CNAs have been proposed, no attempt of a comprehensive comparison of different approaches has yet been published.<h4>Results</h4>We propose a new approach, called Genomic Analysis of Important Alterations (GAIA), to find recurrent CNAs where a statistical hypothesis framework is extended to take into account within-sample homogeneity. Statistical significance and within-sample homogeneity are combined into an iterative procedure to extract the regions that likely are involved in functional changes. Results show that GAIA represents a valid alternative to other proposed approaches. In addition, we perform an accurate comparison by using two real aCGH datasets and a carefully planned simulation study.<h4>Availability</h4>GAIA has been implemented as R/Bioconductor package.

23531787,EDGE-pro: Estimated Degree of Gene Expression in Prokaryotic Genomes.,"<h4>Background</h4>The expression levels of bacterial genes can be measured directly using next-generation sequencing (NGS) methods, offering much greater sensitivity and accuracy than earlier, microarray-based methods. Most bioinformatics software for estimating levels of gene expression from NGS data has been designed for eukaryotic genomes, with algorithms focusing particularly on detection of splicing patterns. These methods do not perform well on bacterial genomes.<h4>Results</h4>Here we describe the first software system designed explicitly for quantifying the degree of gene expression in bacteria and other prokaryotes. EDGE-pro (Estimated Degree of Gene Expression in PROkaryotes) processes the raw data from an RNA-seq experiment on a bacterial or archaeal species and produces estimates of the expression levels for each gene in these gene-dense genomes.<h4>Software</h4>The EDGE-pro tool is implemented as a pipeline of C++ and Perl programs and is freely available as open-source code at http://www.genomics.jhu.edu/software/EDGE/index.shtml.",0,
22759425,Computing the protein binding sites.,"<h4>Background</h4>Identifying the location of binding sites on proteins is of fundamental importance for a wide range of applications including molecular docking, de novo drug design, structure identification and comparison of functional sites. Structural genomic projects are beginning to produce protein structures with unknown functions. Therefore, efficient methods are required if all these structures are to be properly annotated. Lots of methods for finding binding sites involve 3D structure comparison. Here we design a method to find protein binding sites by direct comparison of protein 3D structures.<h4>Results</h4>We have developed an efficient heuristic approach for finding similar binding sites from the surface of given proteins. Our approach consists of three steps: local sequence alignment, protein surface detection, and 3D structures comparison. We implement the algorithm and produce a software package that works well in practice. When comparing a complete protein with all complete protein structures in the PDB database, experiments show that the average recall value of our approach is 82% and the average precision value of our approach is also significantly better than the existing approaches.<h4>Conclusions</h4>Our program has much higher recall values than those existing programs. Experiments show that all the existing approaches have recall values less than 50%. This implies that more than 50% of real binding sites cannot be reported by those existing approaches.

32449511,A strategy for large-scale comparison of evolutionary- and reaction-based classifications of enzyme function.,"Determining the molecular function of enzymes discovered by genome sequencing represents a primary foundation for understanding many aspects of biology. Historically, classification of enzyme reactions has used the enzyme nomenclature system developed to describe the overall reactions performed by biochemically characterized enzymes, irrespective of their associated sequences. In contrast, functional classification and assignment for the millions of protein sequences of unknown function now available is largely done in two computational steps, first by similarity-based assignment of newly obtained sequences to homologous groups, followed by transferring to them the known functions of similar biochemically characterized homologs. Due to the fundamental differences in their etiologies and practice, `how' these chemistry- and evolution-centric functional classification systems relate to each other has been difficult to explore on a large scale. To investigate this issue in a new way, we integrated two published ontologies that had previously described each of these classification systems independently. The resulting infrastructure was then used to compare the functional assignments obtained from each classification system for the well-studied and functionally diverse enolase superfamily. Mapping these function assignments to protein structure and reaction similarity networks shows a profound and complex disconnect between the homology- and chemistry-based classification systems. This conclusion mirrors previous observations suggesting that except for closely related sequences, facile annotation transfer from small numbers of characterized enzymes to the huge number uncharacterized homologs to which they are related is problematic. Our extension of these comparisons to large enzyme superfamilies in a computationally intelligent manner provides a foundation for new directions in protein function prediction for the huge proportion of sequences of unknown function represented in major databases. Interactive sequence, reaction, substrate and product similarity networks computed for this work for the enolase and two other superfamilies are freely available for download from the Structure Function Linkage Database Archive (http://sfld.rbvi.ucsf.edu).",1,
23813003,Using state machines to model the Ion Torrent sequencing process and to improve read error rates.,"<h4>Motivation</h4>The importance of fast and affordable DNA sequencing methods for current day life sciences, medicine and biotechnology is hard to overstate. A major player is Ion Torrent, a pyrosequencing-like technology which produces flowgrams--sequences of incorporation values--which are converted into nucleotide sequences by a base-calling algorithm. Because of its exploitation of ubiquitous semiconductor technology and innovation in chemistry, Ion Torrent has been gaining popularity since its debut in 2011. Despite the advantages, however, Ion Torrent read accuracy remains a significant concern.<h4>Results</h4>We present FlowgramFixer, a new algorithm for converting flowgrams into reads. Our key observation is that the incorporation signals of neighboring flows, even after normalization and phase correction, carry considerable mutual information and are important in making the correct base-call. We therefore propose that base-calling of flowgrams should be done on a read-wide level, rather than one flow at a time. We show that this can be done in linear-time by combining a state machine with a Viterbi algorithm to find the nucleotide sequence that maximizes the likelihood of the observed flowgram. FlowgramFixer is applicable to any flowgram-based sequencing platform. We demonstrate FlowgramFixer's superior performance on Ion Torrent Escherichia coli data, with a 4.8% improvement in the number of high-quality mapped reads and a 7.1% improvement in the number of uniquely mappable reads.<h4>Availability</h4>Binaries and source code of FlowgramFixer are freely available at: http://www.cs.tau.ac.il/~davidgo5/flowgramfixer.html.",0,
27037912,GAMDB: a web resource to connect microRNAs with autophagy in gerontology.,"<h4>Objectives</h4>MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are endogenous ~23 nucleotides (nt) RNAs, regulating gene expression by pairing to the mRNAs of protein-coding genes to direct their post-transcriptional repression. Both in normal and aberrant activities, miRNAs contribute to a recurring paradigm of cellular behaviors in pathological settings, especially in gerontology. Autophagy, a multi-step lysosomal degradation process with function to degrade long-lived proteins and damaged organelles, has significant impact on gerontology. Thus, elucidating how miRNAs participate in autophagy may enlarge the scope of miRNA in autophagy and facilitate researches in gerontology.<h4>Materials and methods</h4>Herein, based upon the published studies, predicted targets and gerontology-related diseases, we constructed a web resource named Gerontology-Autophagic-MicroRNA Database (GAMDB) (http://gamdb.liu-lab.com/index.php), which contained 836 autophagy-related miRNAs, 197 targeted genes/proteins and 56 aging-related diseases such as Parkinson' disease, Alzheimer's disease and Huntington's disease.<h4>Results and conclusion</h4>We made use of large amounts of data to elucidate the intricate relationships between microRNA-regulated autophagic mechanisms and gerontology. This database will facilitate better understanding of autophagy regulation network in gerontology and thus promoting gerontology-related therapy in the future.",1,
24087878,OpenMSI: a high-performance web-based platform for mass spectrometry imaging.,"Mass spectrometry imaging (MSI) enables researchers to directly probe endogenous molecules directly within the architecture of the biological matrix. Unfortunately, efficient access, management, and analysis of the data generated by MSI approaches remain major challenges to this rapidly developing field. Despite the availability of numerous dedicated file formats and software packages, it is a widely held viewpoint that the biggest challenge is simply opening, sharing, and analyzing a file without loss of information. Here we present OpenMSI, a software framework and platform that addresses these challenges via an advanced, high-performance, extensible file format and Web API for remote data access (http://openmsi.nersc.gov). The OpenMSI file format supports storage of raw MSI data, metadata, and derived analyses in a single, self-describing format based on HDF5 and is supported by a large range of analysis software (e.g., Matlab and R) and programming languages (e.g., C++, Fortran, and Python). Careful optimization of the storage layout of MSI data sets using chunking, compression, and data replication accelerates common, selective data access operations while minimizing data storage requirements and are critical enablers of rapid data I/O. The OpenMSI file format has shown to provide >2000-fold improvement for image access operations, enabling spectrum and image retrieval in less than 0.3 s across the Internet even for 50 GB MSI data sets. To make remote high-performance compute resources accessible for analysis and to facilitate data sharing and collaboration, we describe an easy-to-use yet powerful Web API, enabling fast and convenient access to MSI data, metadata, and derived analysis results stored remotely to facilitate high-performance data analysis and enable implementation of Web based data sharing, visualization, and analysis.",1,
25638814,Factor graph analysis of live cell-imaging data reveals mechanisms of cell fate decisions.,"<h4>Motivation</h4>Cell fate decisions have a strong stochastic component. The identification of the underlying mechanisms therefore requires a rigorous statistical analysis of large ensembles of single cells that were tracked and phenotyped over time.<h4>Results</h4>We introduce a probabilistic framework for testing elementary hypotheses on dynamic cell behavior using time-lapse cell-imaging data. Factor graphs, probabilistic graphical models, are used to properly account for cell lineage and cell phenotype information. Our model is applied to time-lapse movies of murine granulocyte-macrophage progenitor (GMP) cells. It decides between competing hypotheses on the mechanisms of their differentiation. Our results theoretically substantiate previous experimental observations that lineage instruction, not selection is the cause for the differentiation of GMP cells into mature monocytes or neutrophil granulocytes.<h4>Availability and implementation</h4>The Matlab source code is available at http://treschgroup.de/Genealogies.html.",0,
31416842,Curatopes Melanoma: A Database of Predicted T-cell Epitopes from Overly Expressed Proteins in Metastatic Cutaneous Melanoma.,"Therapeutic anticancer vaccination has been adapted as an immunotherapy in several solid tumors. However, the selection of promising candidates from the total quantity of possible epitopes poses a challenge to clinicians and bioinformaticians alike, and very few epitopes have been tested in experimental or clinical settings to validate their efficacy. Here, we present a comprehensive database of predicted nonmutated peptide epitopes derived from genes that are overly expressed in a group of 32 melanoma biopsies compared with healthy tissues and that were filtered against expression in a curated list of survival-critical tissues. We hypothesize that these ""self-tolerant"" epitopes have two desirable properties: they do not depend on mutations, being immediately applicable to a large patient collective, and they potentially cause fewer autoimmune reactions.

32438827,Long-Term Exposure to Air Pollution and Incidence of Myocardial Infarction: A Danish Nurse Cohort Study.,"<h4>Background</h4>Air pollution exposure has been linked to coronary heart disease, although evidence on PM2.5 and myocardial infarction (MI) incidence is mixed.<h4>Objectives</h4>This prospective cohort study aimed to investigate associations between long-term exposure to air pollution and MI incidence, adjusting for road traffic noise.<h4>Methods</h4>We used data from the nationwide Danish Nurse Cohort on 22,882 female nurses (>44 years of age) who, at recruitment in 1993 or 1999, reported information on cardiovascular disease risk factors. Data on MI incidence was collected from the Danish National Patient Register until the end of 2014. Annual mean concentrations of particulate matter (PM) with a diameter <2.5 µg/m3 (PM2.5), PM10, nitrogen dioxide (NO2), and nitrogen oxides (NOx) at the nurses' residences since 1990 (PM10 and PM2.5) or 1970 (NO2 and NOx) were estimated using the Danish Eulerian Hemispheric Model/Urban Background Model/AirGIS (DEHM/UBM/AirGIS) dispersion model. We used time-varying Cox regression models to examine the association between 1- and 3-y running means of these pollutants, as well as 23-y running means of NO2 and NOx, with both overall and fatal incident MI. Associations were explored in three progressively adjusted models: Model 1, adjusted for age and baseline year; Model 2, with further adjustment for potential confounding by lifestyle and cardiovascular disease risk factors; and Model 3, with further adjustment for road traffic noise, modeled as the annual mean of a weighted 24-h average (Lden).<h4>Results</h4>Of the 22,882 women, 641 developed MI during a mean follow-up of 18.6 y, 121 (18.9%) of which were fatal. Reported hazard ratios (HRs) were based on interquartile range increases of 5.3, 5.5, 8.1, and 11.5 µg/m3 for PM2.5, PM10, NO2, and NOx, respectively. In Model 1, we observed a positive association between a 3-y running mean of PM2.5 and an overall incident MI with an HR= 1.20 (95% CI: 1.07, 1.35), which attenuated to HR= 1.06 (95% CI: 0.92, 1.23) in Model 2. In Model 1 for incident fatal MI, we observed a strong association with a 3-y running mean of PM2.5, with an HR= 1.69 (95% CI: 1.33, 2.13), which attenuated to HR= 1.35 (95% CI: 1.01, 1.81) in Model 2. Similar associations were seen for PM10, with 3-y, Model 2 estimates for overall and fatal incident MI of HR= 1.06 (95% CI: 0.91, 1.23) and HR= 1.35 (95% CI: 1.01, 1.81), respectively. No evidence of an association was observed for NO2 or NOx. For all pollutants, associations in Model 2 were robust to further adjustment for road traffic noise in Model 3 and were similar for a 1-y running mean exposure.<h4>Conclusions</h4>We found no association between long-term exposure to PM2.5, PM10, NO2, or NOx and overall MI incidence, but we observed positive associations for PM2.5 and PM10 with fatal MI. We present novel findings that the association between PM and MI incidence is robust to adjustment for road traffic noise. https://doi.org/10.1289/EHP5818.",0,
29069297,SeqBox: RNAseq/ChIPseq reproducible analysis on a consumer game computer.,"<h4>Summary</h4>Short reads sequencing technology has been used for more than a decade now. However, the analysis of RNAseq and ChIPseq data is still computational demanding and the simple access to raw data does not guarantee results reproducibility between laboratories. To address these two aspects, we developed SeqBox, a cheap, efficient and reproducible RNAseq/ChIPseq hardware/software solution based on NUC6I7KYK mini-PC (an Intel consumer game computer with a fast processor and a high performance SSD disk), and Docker container platform. In SeqBox the analysis of RNAseq and ChIPseq data is supported by a friendly GUI.

In eukaryotes, both 5mC and 5-hydroxymethylcytosine (5hmC) are now recognized as stable epigenetic marks, with diverse functions. Bacteria, archaea, and viruses contain various other modified DNA nucleobases. Numerous databases describe RNA and histone modifications, but no database specifically catalogues DNA modifications, despite their broad importance in epigenetic regulation. To address this need, we have developed DNAmod: the DNA modification database. DNAmod is an open-source database ( https://dnamod.hoffmanlab.org ) that catalogues DNA modifications and provides a single source to learn about their properties. DNAmod provides a web interface to easily browse and search through these modifications. The database annotates the chemical properties and structures of all curated modified DNA bases, and a much larger list of candidate chemical entities. DNAmod includes manual annotations of available sequencing methods, descriptions of their occurrence in nature, and provides existing and suggested nomenclature. DNAmod enables researchers to rapidly review previous work, select mapping techniques, and track recent developments concerning modified bases of interest.",1,
21929785,The representation of protein complexes in the Protein Ontology (PRO).,"<h4>Background</h4>Representing species-specific proteins and protein complexes in ontologies that are both human- and machine-readable facilitates the retrieval, analysis, and interpretation of genome-scale data sets. Although existing protin-centric informatics resources provide the biomedical research community with well-curated compendia of protein sequence and structure, these resources lack formal ontological representations of the relationships among the proteins themselves. The Protein Ontology (PRO) Consortium is filling this informatics resource gap by developing ontological representations and relationships among proteins and their variants and modified forms. Because proteins are often functional only as members of stable protein complexes, the PRO Consortium, in collaboration with existing protein and pathway databases, has launched a new initiative to implement logical and consistent representation of protein complexes.<h4>Description</h4>We describe here how the PRO Consortium is meeting the challenge of representing species-specific protein complexes, how protein complex representation in PRO supports annotation of protein complexes and comparative biology, and how PRO is being integrated into existing community bioinformatics resources. The PRO resource is accessible at http://pir.georgetown.edu/pro/.<h4>Conclusion</h4>PRO is a unique database resource for species-specific protein complexes. PRO facilitates robust annotation of variations in composition and function contexts for protein complexes within and between species.",1,

25629077,Genetic variability of microRNA regulome in human.,"MicroRNAs are currently being extensively studied due to their important role as post-transcriptional regulators. During miRNA biogenesis, precursors undergo two cleavage steps performed by Drosha-DGCR8 (Microprocessor) cleaving of pri-miRNA to produce pre-miRNA and Dicer-mediated cleaving to create mature miRNA. Genetic variants within human miRNA regulome have been shown to influence miRNA expression, target interaction and to affect the phenotype. In this study, we reviewed the literature, existing bioinformatics tools and catalogs associated with polymorphic miRNA regulome, and organized them into four categories: (1) polymorphisms located within miRNA genes (miR-SNPs), (2) transcription factor-binding sites/miRNA regulatory regions (miR-rSNPs), (3) miRNA target sites (miR-TS-SNPs), and 4. miRNA silencing machinery (miR-SM-SNPs). Since the miR-SM-SNPs have not been systematically studied yet, we have collected polymorphisms associated with miRNA silencing machinery. We have developed two catalogs containing genetic variability within: (1) genes encoding three main catalytic components of the silencing machinery, DROSHA, DGCR8, and DICER1; (2) miRNA genes itself, overlapping Drosha and Dicer cleavage sites. The developed resource of polymorphisms is available online (http://www.integratomics-time.com/miRNA-regulome) and will be useful for further functional studies and development of biomarkers associated with diseases and phenotypic traits.",1,

However, in some infected individuals, this can progress to severe pneumonia and acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), leading to multi-organ failure and death. This study explores the proteomic differences between mild, severe, and critical COVID-19 positive patients to further understand the disease progression, identify proteins associated with disease severity, and identify potential therapeutic targets. Blood protein profiling was performed on 59 COVID-19 mild (n = 26), severe (n = 9) or critical (n = 24) cases and 28 controls using the OLINK inflammation, autoimmune, cardiovascular and neurology panels. Differential expression analysis was performed within and between disease groups to generate nine different analyses. From the 368 proteins measured per individual, more than 75% were observed to be significantly perturbed in COVID-19 cases. Six proteins (IL6, CKAP4, Gal-9, IL-1ra, LILRB4 and PD-L1) were identified to be associated with disease severity. The results have been made readily available through an interactive web-based application for instant data exploration and visualization, and can be accessed at https://phidatalab-shiny.rosalind.kcl.ac.uk/COVID19/ .

However, it is difficult to integrate these diverse data to reconstruct biologically meaningful signaling networks. Previously, we have established a framework for integrating transcriptional, proteomic and interactome data by searching for the solution to the prize-collecting Steiner tree problem. Here, we present a web server, SteinerNet, to make this method available in a user-friendly format for a broad range of users with data from any species. At a minimum, a user only needs to provide a set of experimentally detected proteins and/or genes and the server will search for connections among these data from the provided interactomes for yeast, human, mouse, Drosophila melanogaster and Caenorhabditis elegans. More advanced users can upload their own interactome data as well. The server provides interactive visualization of the resulting optimal network and downloadable files detailing the analysis and results.

31001324,BayesPI-BAR2: A New Python Package for Predicting Functional Non-coding Mutations in Cancer Patient Cohorts.,"Most of somatic mutations in cancer occur outside of gene coding regions. These mutations may disrupt the gene regulation by affecting protein-DNA interaction. A study of these disruptions is important in understanding tumorigenesis. However, current computational tools process DNA sequence variants individually, when predicting the effect on protein-DNA binding. Thus, it is a daunting task to identify functional regulatory disturbances among thousands of mutations in a patient. Previously, we have reported and validated a pipeline for identifying functional non-coding somatic mutations in cancer patient cohorts, by integrating diverse information such as gene expression, spatial distribution of the mutations, and a biophysical model for estimating protein binding affinity. Here, we present a new user-friendly Python package BayesPI-BAR2 based on the proposed pipeline for integrative whole-genome sequence analysis. This may be the first prediction package that considers information from both multiple mutations and multiple patients. It is evaluated in follicular lymphoma and skin cancer patients, by focusing on sequence variants in gene promoter regions. BayesPI-BAR2 is a useful tool for predicting functional non-coding mutations in whole genome sequencing data: it allows identification of novel transcription factors (TFs) whose binding is altered by non-coding mutations in cancer. BayesPI-BAR2 program can analyze multiple datasets of genome-wide mutations at once and generate concise, easily interpretable reports for potentially affected gene regulatory sites.

The neXtProt database (September 2013) lists 20,128 proteins for the human proteome, of which 3831 human proteins (~19%) are considered ""missing"" according to the standard metrics table (released September 27, 2013). In support of the C-HPP initiative, we have extended the annotation strategy developed for human chromosome 7 ""missing"" proteins into a semiautomated pipeline to functionally annotate the ""missing"" human proteome. This pipeline integrates a suite of bioinformatics analysis and annotation software tools to identify homologues and map putative functional signatures, gene ontology, and biochemical pathways. From sequential BLAST searches, we have primarily identified homologues from reviewed nonhuman mammalian proteins with protein evidence for 1271 (33.2%) ""missing"" proteins, followed by 703 (18.4%) homologues from reviewed nonhuman mammalian proteins and subsequently 564 (14.7%) homologues from reviewed human proteins. Functional annotations for 1945 (50.8%) ""missing"" proteins were also determined. To accelerate the identification of ""missing"" proteins from proteomics studies, we generated proteotypic peptides in silico. Matching these proteotypic peptides to ENCODE proteogenomic data resulted in proteomic evidence for 107 (2.8%) of the 3831 ""missing proteins, while evidence from a recent membrane proteomic study supported the existence for another 15 ""missing"" proteins.

Clinical interpretation for such patients in isolation is hindered by the rarity and novelty of such disorders. The DECIPHER project (https://decipher.sanger.ac.uk) was established in 2004 as an accessible online repository of genomic and associated phenotypic data with the primary goal of aiding the clinical interpretation of rare copy-number variants (CNVs). DECIPHER integrates information from a variety of bioinformatics resources and uses visualization tools to identify potential disease genes within a CNV. A two-tier access system permits clinicians and clinical scientists to maintain confidential linked anonymous records of phenotypes and CNVs for their patients that, with informed consent, can subsequently be shared with the wider clinical genetics and research communities. Advances in next-generation sequencing technologies are making it practical and affordable to sequence the whole exome/genome of patients who display features suggestive of a genetic disorder. This approach enables the identification of smaller intragenic mutations including single-nucleotide variants that are not accessible even with high-resolution genomic array analysis. This article briefly summarizes the current status and achievements of the DECIPHER project and looks ahead to the opportunities and challenges of jointly analysing structural and sequence variation in the human genome.",1,

The Marshfield Clinic developed a Heart Health Mobile application (app) that is designed to improve awareness of CVD risk and promote risk factor control among regional smartphone users. It deploys an engaging user interface that provides a brief CVD risk assessment that takes into account self-reported behavioral, familial, and biometric risk factors, including blood pressure and lipids. Users are then directed to nearby community pharmacies, clinics, and other locations where more advanced CVD risk factor screenings can be obtained. Along with social media connections and measurement prompts, basic education materials are provided on key CVD prevention topics such as hypertension, dyslipidemia, weight management, and tobacco cessation. <h4>Methods</h4> A multidisciplinary team of 24 members was created to develop the app over a 30-day timeframe. This team included a broad cross-section of clinical professionals from medicine, epidemiology, health IT, usability and graphic designers, business analytics, and marketing. An Agile programming method was used to promote adaptive planning and evolutionary development in self-organizing, cross-functional teams. <h4>Results</h4> The iOS app was successfully developed, tested, and launched within the 30-day timeframe. It was submitted competitively as part of the Million Hearts Risk Check Challenge, a CVD prevention app contest sponsored by Office of the National Coordinator for Health Information Technology.

33244798,Comparing the motivational value of rewards and losses in an EEG-pupillometry study.,"We found earlier that performance-contingent rewards lead to faster performance than equivalent losses [Carsten, Hoofs, Boehler, & Krebs, 2019. Motivation Science, 5(3). http://dx.doi.org/10.1037/mot0000117]. Here, we further tested the hypothesis that motivation to gain rewards is higher than to avoid losses, even when incentive values are matched. As implicit markers of motivation, we assessed electroencephalography (EEG) focusing on the P3 after target and feedback onset, and the Feedback-Related Negativity (FRN), as well as simultaneously recorded pupil size. Comparing only reward and loss prospect trials in Experiment 1, we found no consistent differences in behavior and electrophysiological markers of motivation, although pupil data suggested higher arousal after feedback in potential-loss trials. Including additional no-incentive trials in Experiment 2, we found consistent evidence that motivation to gain rewards was higher than to avoid losses: In line with behavior, the target-P3 was most pronounced for reward-related stimuli, followed by loss and no-incentive ones. This same ranking was found in the P3 and the FRN after positive outcomes (i.e., reward, avoided loss, and correct feedback in no-incentive trials). Negative outcomes featured a different pattern in line with the pupil response, which suggests that losses are emotionally salient events, without invigorating behavior proportionally. In sum, these findings suggest that the motivation to gain rewards is more pronounced than motivation to avoid equivalent losses, at least in tasks promoting transient increases in attention triggered by incentive prospect. These motivational differences may arise as avoided losses are not profitable in the long term, in contrast to gained rewards.",0,

31784425,Single-Cell Gene Expression Analyses Reveal Distinct Self-Renewing and Proliferating Subsets in the Leukemia Stem Cell Compartment in Acute Myeloid Leukemia.,"Standard chemotherapy for acute myeloid leukemia (AML) targets proliferative cells and efficiently induces complete remission; however, many patients relapse and die of their disease. Relapse is caused by leukemia stem cells (LSC), the cells with self-renewal capacity. Self-renewal and proliferation are separate functions in normal hematopoietic stem cells (HSC) in steady-state conditions. If these functions are also separate functions in LSCs, then antiproliferative therapies may fail to target self-renewal, allowing for relapse. We investigated whether proliferation and self-renewal are separate functions in LSCs as they often are in HSCs. Distinct transcriptional profiles within LSCs of Mll-AF9/NRASG12V murine AML were identified using single-cell RNA sequencing. Single-cell qPCR revealed that these genes were also differentially expressed in primary human LSCs and normal human HSPCs. A smaller subset of these genes was upregulated in LSCs relative to HSPCs; this subset of genes constitutes ""LSC-specific"" genes in human AML. To assess the differences between these profiles, we identified cell surface markers, CD69 and CD36, whose genes were differentially expressed between these profiles. In vivo mouse reconstitution assays resealed that only CD69High LSCs were capable of self-renewal and were poorly proliferative. In contrast, CD36High LSCs were unable to transplant leukemia but were highly proliferative. These data demonstrate that the transcriptional foundations of self-renewal and proliferation are distinct in LSCs as they often are in normal stem cells and suggest that therapeutic strategies that target self-renewal, in addition to proliferation, are critical to prevent relapse and improve survival in AML. SIGNIFICANCE: These findings define and functionally validate a self-renewal gene profile of leukemia stem cells at the single-cell level and demonstrate that self-renewal and proliferation are distinct in AML.

The server takes a protein monomer structure as input and predicts its homo-oligomer structure from oligomer templates selected based on sequence and tertiary/quaternary structure similarity. Using protein model structures as input, the server shows clear improvement over the best methods of CASP9 in predicting oligomeric structures from amino acid sequences.<h4>Availability</h4>http://galaxy.seoklab.org/gemini.<h4>Supplementary information</h4>Supplementary data are available at Bioinformatics online.",0,
34266288,CGRP measurements in human plasma - a methodological study.,"<h4>Background</h4>Calcitonin gene-related peptide plasma levels have frequently been determined as a biomarker for primary headaches. However, published data is often inconsistent resulting from different methods that are not precisely described in most studies.<h4>Methods</h4>We applied a well-proven enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay to measure calcitonin gene-related peptide concentrations in human blood plasma, we modified parameters of plasma preparation and protein purification and used calcitonin gene-related peptide-free plasma for standard solutions, which are described in detail.<h4>Results</h4>Calcitonin gene-related peptide levels are stable in plasma with peptidase inhibitors and after deep-freezing. Calcitonin gene-related peptide standard solutions based on synthetic intercellular fluid or pooled plasma with pre-absorbed calcitonin gene-related peptide influenced the measurements but yielded both comprehensible results. In a sample of 56 healthy subjects the calcitonin gene-related peptide plasma levels varied considerably from low (<50 pg/mL) to very high (>500 pg/mL) values. After a 12-hour exposure of these subjects to normobaric hypoxia the individual calcitonin gene-related peptide levels remained stable.<h4>Conclusion</h4>Buffering with peptidase inhibitors and immediate freezing or processing of plasma samples is essential to achieve reliable measurements. Individuals show considerable differences and partly high calcitonin gene-related peptide plasma levels without detectable pathological reason. Thus plasma measurements are suited particularly to follow calcitonin gene-related peptide levels in longitudinal studies.The use of data for this study was approved by the Ethics Committee of the MedicalUniversity of Innsbruck (https://www.i-med.ac.at/ethikkommission/; EK Nr: 1242/2017).",0,

In 2014, the National Institutes of Health, National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute (NHLBI) funded an Administrative Supplement to the PhenX Toolkit (consensus measures for Phenotypes and eXposures; https://www.phenxtoolkit.org/) to identify common measures to promote data comparability across SCD research. An 11-member Sickle Cell Disease Research and Scientific Panel provided guidance to the project, establishing a core collection of SCD-related measures and defining the scope of 2 specialty collections: (1) cardiovascular, pulmonary, and renal complications, and (2) neurology, quality-of-life, and health services. For each specialty collection, a working group of SCD experts selected high-priority measures using a consensus process that included scientific community input. The SCD measures were released into the Toolkit in August 2015. The 25 measures included in the core collection are recommended for use by all NHLBI-funded investigators performing human-subject SCD research. The 10 neurology, quality-of-life, and health services measures and 14 cardiovascular, pulmonary, and renal measures are recommended for use within these specialized research areas. For SCD and other researchers, PhenX measures will promote collaborations with clinicians and patients, facilitate cross-study analysis, accelerate translational research, and lead to greater understanding of SCD phenotypes and epigenetics. For clinicians, using PhenX measures will help elucidate the etiology, progression, and treatment of SCD, leading to improved patient care and quality of life.",1,

24843014,APOBEC3A deaminates transiently exposed single-strand DNA during LINE-1 retrotransposition.,"Long INterspersed Element-1 (LINE-1 or L1) retrotransposition poses a mutagenic threat to human genomes. Human cells have therefore evolved strategies to regulate L1 retrotransposition. The APOBEC3 (A3) gene family consists of seven enzymes that catalyze deamination of cytidine nucleotides to uridine nucleotides (C-to-U) in single-strand DNA substrates. Among these enzymes, APOBEC3A (A3A) is the most potent inhibitor of L1 retrotransposition in cultured cell assays. However, previous characterization of L1 retrotransposition events generated in the presence of A3A did not yield evidence of deamination. Thus, the molecular mechanism by which A3A inhibits L1 retrotransposition has remained enigmatic. Here, we have used in vitro and in vivo assays to demonstrate that A3A can inhibit L1 retrotransposition by deaminating transiently exposed single-strand DNA that arises during the process of L1 integration. These data provide a mechanistic explanation of how the A3A cytidine deaminase protein can inhibit L1 retrotransposition.DOI: http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.02008.001.",0,

25833981,Community-based management of severe acute malnutrition in India: new evidence from Bihar.,"<h4>Background</h4>An estimated one-third of the world's children who are wasted live in India. In Bihar state, of children <5 y old, 27.1% are wasted and 8.3% have severe acute malnutrition (SAM). In 2009, MÈdecins Sans FrontiËres (MSF) initiated a community-based management of acute malnutrition (CMAM) program for children aged 6-59 mo with SAM.<h4>Objective</h4>In this report, we describe the characteristics and outcomes of 8274 children treated between February 2009 and September 2011.<h4>Design</h4>Between February 2009 and June 2010, the program admitted children with a weight-for-height z score (WHZ) <-3 SD and/or midupper arm circumference (MUAC) <110 mm and discharged those who reached a WHZ >-2 SDs and MUAC >110 mm. These variables changed in July 2010 to admission on the basis of an MUAC <115 mm and discharge at an MUAC =120 mm. Uncomplicated SAM cases were treated as outpatients in the community by using a WHO-standard, ready-to-use, therapeutic lipid-based paste produced in India; complicated cases were treated as inpatients by using F75/F100 WHO-standard milk until they could complete treatment in the community.<h4>Results</h4>A total of 8274 children were admitted including 5149 girls (62.2%), 6613 children aged 6-23 mo (79.9%), and 87.3% children who belonged to Scheduled Caste, Scheduled Tribe, or Other Backward Caste families or households. Of 3873 children admitted under the old criteria, 41 children (1.1%) died, 2069 children (53.4%) were discharged as cured, and 1485 children (38.3%) defaulted. Of 4401 children admitted under the new criteria, 36 children (0.8%) died, 2526 children (57.4%) were discharged as cured, and 1591 children (36.2%) defaulted. For children discharged as cured, the mean (±SD) weight gain and length of stay were 4.7 ± 3.1 and 5.1 ± 3.7 g ∑ kg(-1) ∑ d(-1) and 8.7 ± 6.1 and 7.3 ± 5.6 wk under the old and new criteria, respectively (P < 0.01). After adjustment, significant risk factors for default were as follows: no community referral for admission, more severe wasting on admission, younger age, and a long commute for treatment.<h4>Conclusions</h4>To our knowledge, this is the first conventional CMAM program in India and has achieved low mortality and high cure rates in nondefaulting children. The new admission criteria lower the threshold for severity with the result that more children are included who are at lower risk of death and have a smaller WHZ deficit to correct than do children identified by the old criteria.

26777304,dbEM: A database of epigenetic modifiers curated from cancerous and normal genomes.,"We have developed a database called dbEM (database of Epigenetic Modifiers) to maintain the genomic information of about 167 epigenetic modifiers/proteins, which are considered as potential cancer targets. In dbEM, modifiers are classified on functional basis and comprise of 48 histone methyl transferases, 33 chromatin remodelers and 31 histone demethylases. dbEM maintains the genomic information like mutations, copy number variation and gene expression in thousands of tumor samples, cancer cell lines and healthy samples. This information is obtained from public resources viz. COSMIC, CCLE and 1000-genome project. Gene essentiality data retrieved from COLT database further highlights the importance of various epigenetic proteins for cancer survival. We have also reported the sequence profiles, tertiary structures and post-translational modifications of these epigenetic proteins in cancer. It also contains information of 54 drug molecules against different epigenetic proteins. A wide range of tools have been integrated in dbEM e.g. Search, BLAST, Alignment and Profile based prediction. In our analysis, we found that epigenetic proteins DNMT3A, HDAC2, KDM6A, and TET2 are highly mutated in variety of cancers. We are confident that dbEM will be very useful in cancer research particularly in the field of epigenetic proteins based cancer therapeutics.

25480679,Marky: a tool supporting annotation consistency in multi-user and iterative document annotation projects.,"<h4>Background and objectives</h4>Document annotation is a key task in the development of Text Mining methods and applications. High quality annotated corpora are invaluable, but their preparation requires a considerable amount of resources and time. Although the existing annotation tools offer good user interaction interfaces to domain experts, project management and quality control abilities are still limited. Therefore, the current work introduces Marky, a new Web-based document annotation tool equipped to manage multi-user and iterative projects, and to evaluate annotation quality throughout the project life cycle.<h4>Methods</h4>At the core, Marky is a Web application based on the open source CakePHP framework. User interface relies on HTML5 and CSS3 technologies. Rangy library assists in browser-independent implementation of common DOM range and selection tasks, and Ajax and JQuery technologies are used to enhance user-system interaction.<h4>Results</h4>Marky grants solid management of inter- and intra-annotator work. Most notably, its annotation tracking system supports systematic and on-demand agreement analysis and annotation amendment. Each annotator may work over documents as usual, but all the annotations made are saved by the tracking system and may be further compared. So, the project administrator is able to evaluate annotation consistency among annotators and across rounds of annotation, while annotators are able to reject or amend subsets of annotations made in previous rounds. As a side effect, the tracking system minimises resource and time consumption.<h4>Conclusions</h4>Marky is a novel environment for managing multi-user and iterative document annotation projects. Compared to other tools, Marky offers a similar visually intuitive annotation experience while providing unique means to minimise annotation effort and enforce annotation quality, and therefore corpus consistency.

28490512,Preconceptional and gestational weight trajectories and risk of delivering a small-for-gestational-age baby in rural Gambia.,"<b>Background:</b> Maternal nutritional status is a key determinant of small for gestational age (SGA), but some knowledge gaps remain, particularly regarding the role of the energy balance entering pregnancy.<b>Objective:</b> We investigated how preconceptional and gestational weight trajectories (summarized by individual-level traits) are associated with SGA risk in rural Gambia.<b>Design:</b> The sample comprised 670 women in a trial with serial weight data (7310 observations) that were available before and during pregnancy. Individual trajectories from 6 mo before conception to 30 wk of gestation were produced with the use of multilevel modeling. Summary traits were expressed as weight <i>z</i> scores [weight <i>z</i> score at 3 mo preconception (<i>z</i>wt<sub>-3 mo</sub>), weight <i>z</i> score at conception, weight <i>z</i> score at 3 mo postconception, weight <i>z</i> score at 7 mo postconception (<i>z</i>wt<sub>+7 mo</sub>), and conditional measures that represented the change from the preceding time] and were related to SGA risk with the use of Poisson regression with confounder adjustment; linear splines were used to account for nonlinearity.<b>Results:</b> Maternal weight at each time point had a consistent nonlinear relation with SGA risk. For example, the <i>z</i>wt<sub>-3 mo</sub> estimate was stronger in women with values =0.5 (RR: 0.736; 95% CI: 0.594, 0.910) than in women with values >0.5 (RR: 0.920; 95% CI: 0.682, 1.241). The former group had the highest observed SGA prevalence. Focusing on weight change, only conditional <i>z</i>wt<sub>+7 mo</sub> was associated with SGA and only in women with values >-0.5 (RR: 0.579; 95% CI: 0.463, 0.724).<b>Conclusions:</b> Protection against delivering an SGA neonate offered by greater preconceptional or gestational weight may be most pronounced in more undernourished and vulnerable women. Independent of this possibility, greater second- and third-trimester weight gain beyond a threshold may be protective. This trial was registered at http://www.isrctn.com/ as ISRCTN49285450.",0,
26072510,Reconstruction of clonal trees and tumor composition from multi-sample sequencing data.,"<h4>Motivation</h4>DNA sequencing of multiple samples from the same tumor provides data to analyze the process of clonal evolution in the population of cells that give rise to a tumor.<h4>Results</h4>We formalize the problem of reconstructing the clonal evolution of a tumor using single-nucleotide mutations as the variant allele frequency (VAF) factorization problem. We derive a combinatorial characterization of the solutions to this problem and show that the problem is NP-complete. We derive an integer linear programming solution to the VAF factorization problem in the case of error-free data and extend this solution to real data with a probabilistic model for errors. The resulting AncesTree algorithm is better able to identify ancestral relationships between individual mutations than existing approaches, particularly in ultra-deep sequencing data when high read counts for mutations yield high confidence VAFs.<h4>Availability and implementation</h4>An implementation of AncesTree is available at: http://compbio.cs.brown.edu/software.",0,
23303509,ALE: a generic assembly likelihood evaluation framework for assessing the accuracy of genome and metagenome assemblies.,"<h4>Motivation</h4>Researchers need general purpose methods for objectively evaluating the accuracy of single and metagenome assemblies and for automatically detecting any errors they may contain. Current methods do not fully meet this need because they require a reference, only consider one of the many aspects of assembly quality or lack statistical justification, and none are designed to evaluate metagenome assemblies.<h4>Results</h4>In this article, we present an Assembly Likelihood Evaluation (ALE) framework that overcomes these limitations, systematically evaluating the accuracy of an assembly in a reference-independent manner using rigorous statistical methods. This framework is comprehensive, and integrates read quality, mate pair orientation and insert length (for paired-end reads), sequencing coverage, read alignment and k-mer frequency. ALE pinpoints synthetic errors in both single and metagenomic assemblies, including single-base errors, insertions/deletions, genome rearrangements and chimeric assemblies presented in metagenomes. At the genome level with real-world data, ALE identifies three large misassemblies from the Spirochaeta smaragdinae finished genome, which were all independently validated by Pacific Biosciences sequencing. At the single-base level with Illumina data, ALE recovers 215 of 222 (97%) single nucleotide variants in a training set from a GC-rich Rhodobacter sphaeroides genome. Using real Pacific Biosciences data, ALE identifies 12 of 12 synthetic errors in a Lambda Phage genome, surpassing even Pacific Biosciences' own variant caller, EviCons. In summary, the ALE framework provides a comprehensive, reference-independent and statistically rigorous measure of single genome and metagenome assembly accuracy, which can be used to identify misassemblies or to optimize the assembly process.<h4>Availability</h4>ALE is released as open source software under the UoI/NCSA license at http://www.alescore.org.

25179504,Differential motif enrichment analysis of paired ChIP-seq experiments.,"<h4>Background</h4>Motif enrichment analysis of transcription factor ChIP-seq data can help identify transcription factors that cooperate or compete. Previously, little attention has been given to comparative motif enrichment analysis of pairs of ChIP-seq experiments, where the binding of the same transcription factor is assayed under different conditions. Such comparative analysis could potentially identify the distinct regulatory partners/competitors of the assayed transcription factor under different conditions or at different stages of development.<h4>Results</h4>We describe a new methodology for identifying sequence motifs that are differentially enriched in one set of DNA or RNA sequences relative to another set, and apply it to paired ChIP-seq experiments. We show that, using paired ChIP-seq data for a single transcription factor, differential motif enrichment analysis identifies all the known key transcription factors involved in the transformation of non-cancerous immortalized breast cells (MCF10A-ER-Src cells) into cancer stem cells whereas non-differential motif enrichment analysis does not. We also show that differential motif enrichment analysis identifies regulatory motifs that are significantly enriched at constrained locations within the bound promoters, and that these motifs are not identified by non-differential motif enrichment analysis. Our methodology differs from other approaches in that it leverages both comparative enrichment and positional enrichment of motifs in ChIP-seq peak regions or in the promoters of genes bound by the transcription factor.<h4>Conclusions</h4>We show that differential motif enrichment analysis of paired ChIP-seq experiments offers biological insights not available from non-differential analysis. In contrast to previous approaches, our method detects motifs that are enriched in a constrained region in one set of sequences, but not enriched in the same region in the comparative set. We have enhanced the web-based CentriMo algorithm to allow it to perform the constrained differential motif enrichment analysis described in this paper, and CentriMo's on-line interface (http://meme.ebi.edu.au) provides dozens of databases of DNA- and RNA-binding motifs from a full range of organisms.

26321999,Speech error and tip of the tongue diary for mobile devices.,"Collections of various types of speech errors have increased our understanding of the acquisition, production, and perception of language. Although such collections of naturally occurring language errors are invaluable for a number of reasons, the process of collecting various types of speech errors presents many challenges to the researcher interested in building such a collection, among them a significant investment of time and effort to obtain a sufficient number of examples to enable statistical analysis. Here we describe a freely accessible website http://spedi.ku.edu that helps users document slips of the tongue, slips of the ear, and tip of the tongue states that they experience firsthand or observe in others. The documented errors are amassed, and made available for other users to analyze, thereby distributing the time and effort involved in collecting errors across a large number of individuals instead of saddling the lone researcher, and facilitating distribution of the collection to other researchers. This approach also addresses some issues related to data curation that hampered previous error collections, and enables the collection to continue to grow over a longer period of time than previous collections. Finally, this web-based tool creates an opportunity for language scientists to engage in outreach efforts to increase the understanding of language disorders and research in the general public.",1,
30244175,PTMD: A Database of Human Disease-associated Post-translational Modifications.,"Various posttranslational modifications (PTMs) participate in nearly all aspects of biological processes by regulating protein functions, and aberrant states of PTMs are frequently implicated in human diseases. Therefore, an integral resource of PTM-disease associations (PDAs) would be a great help for both academic research and clinical use. In this work, we reported PTMD, a well-curated database containing PTMs that are associated with human diseases. We manually collected 1950 known PDAs in 749 proteins for 23 types of PTMs and 275 types of diseases from the literature. Database analyses show that phosphorylation has the largest number of disease associations, whereas neurologic diseases have the largest number of PTM associations. We classified all known PDAs into six classes according to the PTM status in diseases and demonstrated that the upregulation and presence of PTM events account for a predominant proportion of disease-associated PTM events. By reconstructing a disease-gene network, we observed that breast cancers have the largest number of associated PTMs and AKT1 has the largest number of PTMs connected to diseases. Finally, the PTMD database was developed with detailed annotations and can be a useful resource for further analyzing the relations between PTMs and human diseases.

32281541,Effects of the ACT OUT! Social Issue Theater Program on Social-Emotional Competence and Bullying in Youth and Adolescents: Protocol for a Cluster Randomized Controlled Trial.,"BACKGROUND:Students in the United States spend a meaningful portion of their developmental lives in school. In recent years, researchers and educators have begun to focus explicitly on social and emotional learning (SEL) in the school setting. Initial evidence from meta-analyses suggests that curricula designed to promote SEL likely produce benefits in terms of social-emotional competence (SEC) and numerous related behavioral and affective outcomes. At the same time, there are often barriers to implementing such curricula as intended, and some researchers have questioned the strength of the evaluation data from SEL programs. As part of the effort to improve programming in SEL, this paper describes the protocol for a cluster randomized trial of the ACT OUT! Social Issue Theater program, a brief psychodramatic intervention to build SEC and reduce bullying behavior in students. OBJECTIVE:The objective of this trial is to examine if a short dose of interactive psychodrama can affect SEC metrics and bullying experiences in schoolchildren in either the short (2-week) or medium (6-month) term. METHODS:The ACT OUT! trial is a cluster randomized superiority trial with 2 parallel groups. The unit of measurement is the student, and the unit of randomization is the classroom. For each grade (fourth, seventh, and 10th), an even number of classrooms will be selected from each school-half will be assigned to the intervention arm and half will be assigned to the control arm. The intervention will consist of 3 moderated psychodramatic performances by trained actors, and the control condition will be the usual school day. Outcome data will be collected at baseline (preintervention), 2-week postintervention (short term), and 6-month postintervention (medium term). Outcomes will include social-emotional competency; self-reported bullying and experiences of being bullied; receptivity to the program; and school-level data on truancy, absenteeism, and referrals to school displinary action for bullying. A power analysis adjusted for clustering effect, design effect, and potential attrition yielded a need for approximately 1594 students, consisting of an estimated 80 classrooms split evenly into intervention and control arms. RESULTS:This study was funded in June 2019; approved by the Indiana University Institutional review board on September 17, 2019; began subject recruitment on November 5, 2019; and prospectively registered with ClinicalTrials.gov. CONCLUSIONS:Many states have issued recommendations for the integration of SEL into schools. The proposed study uses a rigorous methodology to determine if the ACT OUT! psychodramatic intervention is a cost-effective means of bolstering SEC and reducing bullying incidence in schools.

29253072,K2 and K2*: efficient alignment-free sequence similarity measurement based on Kendall statistics.,"<h4>Motivation</h4>Alignment-free sequence comparison methods can compute the pairwise similarity between a huge number of sequences much faster than sequence-alignment based methods.<h4>Results</h4>We propose a new non-parametric alignment-free sequence comparison method, called K2, based on the Kendall statistics. Comparing to the other state-of-the-art alignment-free comparison methods, K2 demonstrates competitive performance in generating the phylogenetic tree, in evaluating functionally related regulatory sequences, and in computing the edit distance (similarity/dissimilarity) between sequences. Furthermore, the K2 approach is much faster than the other methods. An improved method, K2*, is also proposed, which is able to determine the appropriate algorithmic parameter (length) automatically, without first considering different values. Comparative analysis with the state-of-the-art alignment-free sequence similarity methods demonstrates the superiority of the proposed approaches, especially with increasing sequence length, or increasing dataset sizes.<h4>Availability and implementation</h4>The K2 and K2* approaches are implemented in the R language as a package and is freely available for open access (http://community.wvu.edu/daadjeroh/projects/K2/K2_1.0.tar.gz).<h4>Contact</h4>yueljiang@163.com.<h4>Supplementary information</h4>Supplementary data are available at Bioinformatics online.",0,
PMC6666521,PSIII-22 Performance of DNA 600 Duroc sired pigs when split sex fed with commercial diets with or without a blend of phytonutrients (Lean Fuel),"Abstract The objective was to evaluate the effect of a blend of phytonutrients (Lean Fuel, LF) on performance of pigs in late finishing in a commercial research barn. A total of 590 DNA 600 Duroc finishing pigs (BW=75.7 + 1.0 kg) were blocked by weight and sex and allocated across two dietary treatments with 6 replications per treatment and 21 to 26 pigs per pen. Dietary treatments were: barrow (B) diets with and without LF and gilt (G) diets with and without LF. Diets were formulated to split-sex requirements (CON) for each period and LF diets were control diets + 0.125% LF. The experiment was 44-d where d 0 was 98-d post-wean. All data were analyzed using the MIXED procedure of SAS as a randomized complete block design as a 2 x 2 (diet x sex) factorial arrangement. Pen served as the experimental unit. Overall (d 0-44), the B gained more weight (P = 0.0282) and consumed more feed (P > 0.10) in ADFI. There was no diet x sex interaction (P > 0.10) for ADG. There was a tendency for an interaction (P = 0.0545) for ADFI, where LF B consumed more feed compared to CON B and CON G consumed more feed compared to LF G. There was an interaction for G:F (P = 0.0028) where G on LF had higher G:F compared to G on CON whereas G:F for B was not different to B on LF. In conclusion, LF improved ADG and G:F, but did so differently for G and B.  http://www.conferenceharvester.com/",0,
24060102,Comparative genomics of metabolic capacities of regulons controlled by cis-regulatory RNA motifs in bacteria.,"<h4>Background</h4>In silico comparative genomics approaches have been efficiently used for functional prediction and reconstruction of metabolic and regulatory networks. Riboswitches are metabolite-sensing structures often found in bacterial mRNA leaders controlling gene expression on transcriptional or translational levels.An increasing number of riboswitches and other cis-regulatory RNAs have been recently classified into numerous RNA families in the Rfam database. High conservation of these RNA motifs provides a unique advantage for their genomic identification and comparative analysis.<h4>Results</h4>A comparative genomics approach implemented in the RegPredict tool was used for reconstruction and functional annotation of regulons controlled by RNAs from 43 Rfam families in diverse taxonomic groups of Bacteria. The inferred regulons include ~5200 cis-regulatory RNAs and more than 12000 target genes in 255 microbial genomes. All predicted RNA-regulated genes were classified into specific and overall functional categories. Analysis of taxonomic distribution of these categories allowed us to establish major functional preferences for each analyzed cis-regulatory RNA motif family. Overall, most RNA motif regulons showed predictable functional content in accordance with their experimentally established effector ligands. Our results suggest that some RNA motifs (including thiamin pyrophosphate and cobalamin riboswitches that control the cofactor metabolism) are widespread and likely originated from the last common ancestor of all bacteria. However, many more analyzed RNA motifs are restricted to a narrow taxonomic group of bacteria and likely represent more recent evolutionary innovations.<h4>Conclusions</h4>The reconstructed regulatory networks for major known RNA motifs substantially expand the existing knowledge of transcriptional regulation in bacteria. The inferred regulons can be used for genetic experiments, functional annotations of genes, metabolic reconstruction and evolutionary analysis. The obtained genome-wide collection of reference RNA motif regulons is available in the RegPrecise database (http://regprecise.lbl.gov/).",1,
22506599,SPAdes: a new genome assembly algorithm and its applications to single-cell sequencing.,"The lion's share of bacteria in various environments cannot be cloned in the laboratory and thus cannot be sequenced using existing technologies. A major goal of single-cell genomics is to complement gene-centric metagenomic data with whole-genome assemblies of uncultivated organisms. Assembly of single-cell data is challenging because of highly non-uniform read coverage as well as elevated levels of sequencing errors and chimeric reads. We describe SPAdes, a new assembler for both single-cell and standard (multicell) assembly, and demonstrate that it improves on the recently released E+V-SC assembler (specialized for single-cell data) and on popular assemblers Velvet and SoapDeNovo (for multicell data).

33190499,LigMate: A Multifeature Integration Algorithm for Ligand-Similarity-Based Virtual Screening.,"Ligand-similarity-based virtual screening is one of the most applicable computer-aided drug design techniques. The current methodology relies heavily on several descriptors of molecular features, including atoms (zero-dimensional, 0D), the presence or absence of structural features (one-dimensional, 1D), topological descriptors (two-dimensional, 2D), geometry and volume (three-dimensional, 3D), or stereoelectronic and stereodynamic properties (four-dimensional, 4D). These descriptors have been frequently used in virtual screening; however, they are usually used independently without integration, which may hinder effective and precise virtual screening. In this study, we developed a multifeature integration algorithm named LigMate, which employs a Hungarian algorithm-based matching and a machine learning-based nonlinear combination of various descriptors, including the new relevant descriptors focusing on the maximum common substructures (maximum common substructure score, MCSS), the relative distance of atoms from the ligand mass center (intraligand distance score, ILDS), as well as the ring differences (ring score, RS). In the benchmark tests, LigMate achieved an overall enrichment factor of the first percent (EF1) of 36.14 and an area under the curve (AUC) value of 0.81 on the DUD-E data set, as well as an EF1 of 15.44 and an AUC of 0.69 on the maximum unbiased validation (MUV) data set, outperforming the control methods that are based on single descriptors. Thus, our study provides a new framework for multiple feature integration, which can benefit ligand-similarity-based virtual screening.

Theme 1 focused on improving our understanding of individualsí and organisational risk factors and on improving the quality of risk assessments (work packages 1ñ3) and theme 2 focused on developing patient-reported outcome measures (work packages 4 and 5).<h4>Methods</h4>The programme comprised 21 individual pieces of work. Pain: (1) multicentre pain prevalence study in acute hospitals, (2) multicentre pain prevalence study in community localities incorporating (3) a comparison of case-finding methods, and (4) multicentre, prospective cohort study. Severe pressure ulcers: (5) retrospective case study, (6) patient involvement workshop with the Pressure Ulcer Research Service User Network for the UK (PURSUN UK) and (7) development of root cause analysis methodology. Risk assessment: (8) systematic review, (9) consensus study, (10) conceptual framework development and theoretical causal pathway, (11) design and pretesting of draft Risk Assessment Framework and (12) field test to assess reliability, validity, data completeness and clinical usability. Quality of life: (13) conceptual framework development (systematic review, patient interviews), (14 and 15) provisional instrument development, with items generated from patient interviews [from (1) above] two systematic reviews and experts, (16) pretesting of the provisional Pressure Ulcer Quality of Life (PU-QOL) instrument using mixed methods, (17) field test 1 including (18) optimal mode of administration substudy and item reduction with testing of scale formation, acceptability, scaling assumptions, reliability and validity, and (19) field test 2 ñ final psychometric evaluation to test scale targeting, item response categories, item fit, response bias, acceptability, scaling assumptions, reliability and validity. Costñutility: (20) time trade-off task valuations of health states derived from selected PU-QOL items, and (21) validation of the items selected and psychometric properties of the new Pressure Ulcer Quality of Life Utility Index (PUQOL-UI).<h4>Key findings</h4>Pain: prevalence studies ñ hospital and community patients experience both pressure area-related and pressure ulcer pain; pain cohort study ñ indicates that pain is independently predictive of category 2 (and above) pressure ulcer development. Severe pressure ulcers: these were more likely to develop in contexts in which clinicians failed to listen to patients/carers or recognise/respond to high risk or the presence of an existing pressure ulcer and services were not effectively co-ordinated; service users found the interactive workshop format valuable; including novel components (interviews with patients and carers) in root cause analysis improves the quality of the insights captured. Risk assessment: we developed a Pressure Ulcer Risk Assessment Framework, the PURPOSE-T, incorporating the Minimum Data Set, a screening stage, a full assessment stage, use of colour to support decision-making, and decision pathways that make a clear distinction between patients with an existing pressure ulcer(s) (or scarring from previous ulcers) who require secondary prevention and treatment and those at risk who require primary prevention (http://medhealth.leeds.ac.uk/accesspurposet). Quality of life: the final PU-QOL instrument consists of 10 scales to measure pain, exudate, odour, sleep, vitality, mobility/movement, daily activities, emotional well-being, self-consciousness and appearance, and participation (http://medhealth.leeds.ac.uk/puqol-ques). Costñutility: seven items were selected from the PU-QOL instrument for inclusion in the PUQOL-UI (http://medhealth.leeds.ac.uk/puqol-ui); secondary study analysis indicated that item selection for the PUQOL-UI was appropriate and that the index was acceptable to patients and had adequate levels of validity.<h4>Conclusions</h4>The PURPOSE programme has provided important insights for pressure ulcer prevention and treatment and involvement of service users in research and development, with implications for patient and public involvement, clinical practice, quality/safety/health service management and research including replication of the pain risk factor study, work exploring ëbest practiceí settings, the impact of including skin status as an indicator for escalation of preventative interventions, further psychometric evaluation of PU-QOL and PUQOL-UI the measurement of ëdisease attribution.í<h4>Funding</h4>The National Institute for Health Research Programme Grants for Applied Research programme.",0,
25887233,Kernel approaches for differential expression analysis of mass spectrometry-based metabolomics data.,"<h4>Background</h4>Data generated from metabolomics experiments are different from other types of ""-omics"" data. For example, a common phenomenon in mass spectrometry (MS)-based metabolomics data is that the data matrix frequently contains missing values, which complicates some quantitative analyses. One way to tackle this problem is to treat them as absent. Hence there are two types of information that are available in metabolomics data: presence/absence of a metabolite and a quantitative value of the abundance level of a metabolite if it is present. Combining these two layers of information poses challenges to the application of traditional statistical approaches in differential expression analysis.<h4>Results</h4>In this article, we propose a novel kernel-based score test for the metabolomics differential expression analysis. In order to simultaneously capture both the continuous pattern and discrete pattern in metabolomics data, two new kinds of kernels are designed. One is the distance-based kernel and the other is the stratified kernel. While we initially describe the procedures in the case of single-metabolite analysis, we extend the methods to handle metabolite sets as well.<h4>Conclusions</h4>Evaluation based on both simulated data and real data from a liver cancer metabolomics study indicates that our kernel method has a better performance than some existing alternatives. An implementation of the proposed kernel method in the R statistical computing environment is available at http://works.bepress.com/debashis_ghosh/60/ .",0,

29209336,DRDB: An Online Date Palm Genomic Resource Database.,"Background: Date palm (Phoenix dactylifera L.) is a cultivated woody plant with agricultural and economic importance in many countries around the world. With the advantages of next generation sequencing technologies, genome sequences for many date palm cultivars have been released recently. Short sequence repeat (SSR) and single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) can be identified from these genomic data, and have been proven to be very useful biomarkers in plant genome analysis and breeding. Results: Here, we first improved the date palm genome assembly using 130X of HiSeq data generated in our lab. Then 246,445 SSRs (214,901 SSRs and 31,544 compound SSRs) were annotated in this genome assembly; among the SSRs, mononucleotide SSRs (58.92%) were the most abundant, followed by di- (29.92%), tri- (8.14%), tetra- (2.47%), penta- (0.36%), and hexa-nucleotide SSRs (0.19%). The high-quality PCR primer pairs were designed for most (174,497; 70.81% out of total) SSRs. We also annotated 6,375,806 SNPs with raw read depth=3 in 90% cultivars. To further reduce false positive SNPs, we only kept 5,572,650 (87.40% out of total) SNPs with at least 20% cultivars support for downstream analyses. The high-quality PCR primer pairs were also obtained for 4,177,778 (65.53%) SNPs. We reconstructed the phylogenetic relationships among the 62 cultivars using these variants and found that they can be divided into three clusters, namely North Africa, Egypt - Sudan, and Middle East - South Asian, with Egypt - Sudan being the admixture of North Africa and Middle East - South Asian cultivars; we further confirmed these clusters using principal component analysis. Moreover, 34,346 SSRs and 4,177,778 SNPs with PCR primers were assigned to shared cultivars for cultivar classification and diversity analysis. All these SSRs, SNPs and their classification are available in our database, and can be used for cultivar identification, comparison, and molecular breeding. Conclusion:DRDB is a comprehensive genomic resource database of date palm. It can serve as a bioinformatics platform for date palm genomics, genetics, and molecular breeding.

28203233,Exo-miRExplorer: A Comprehensive Resource for Exploring and Comparatively Analyzing Exogenous MicroRNAs.,"MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are small regulatory RNAs that play important roles in animals, plants, and viruses. Deep-sequencing technology has been widely adopted in miRNA investigations. However, it is still a big mysterious why nearly all sequencing data contain miRNA sequences from exogenous species, called exo-miRNAs. In this study, we developed a novel platform, exo-miRExplorer, for mining and identifying exo-miRNAs from high-throughput small RNA sequencing experiments which originated from tissues and cell lines of multiple organisms. Thousands of exo-miRNAs are characterized with their expression abundance, the RNA families, original organisms and the sequencing platforms presented in exo-miRExplorer. Subsequently, we used exo-miRExplorer to perform further analysis. Comparative analysis of the exo-miRNAs between different sequencing datasets revealed significant correlation of exo-miRNAs between experiments in the same study. The plant-derived exo-miRNAs analysis provided robust evidence for non-diet source of exo-miRNAs. Virus-derived exo-miRNA analysis showed that pathogen RNAs could transfer to host cells and exist in deep-sequencing result at abundance level. In conclusion, exo-miRExplorer provides users with an integrative resource to facilitate detection and analysis of exo-miRNAs. exo-miRExplorer is available at the following URL: http://rna.sysu.edu.cn/exomiRDB/.",1,
31873725,Causal network perturbations for instance-specific analysis of single cell and disease samples.,"<h4>Motivation</h4>Complex diseases involve perturbation in multiple pathways and a major challenge in clinical genomics is characterizing pathway perturbations in individual samples. This can lead to patient-specific identification of the underlying mechanism of disease thereby improving diagnosis and personalizing treatment. Existing methods rely on external databases to quantify pathway activity scores. This ignores the data dependencies and that pathways are incomplete or condition-specific.<h4>Results</h4>ssNPA is a new approach for subtyping samples based on deregulation of their gene networks. ssNPA learns a causal graph directly from control data. Sample-specific network neighborhood deregulation is quantified via the error incurred in predicting the expression of each gene from its Markov blanket. We evaluate the performance of ssNPA on liver development single-cell RNA-seq data, where the correct cell timing is recovered; and two TCGA datasets, where ssNPA patient clusters have significant survival differences. In all analyses ssNPA consistently outperforms alternative methods, highlighting the advantage of network-based approaches.<h4>Availability and implementation</h4>http://www.benoslab.pitt.edu/Software/ssnpa/.<h4>Supplementary information</h4>Supplementary data are available at Bioinformatics online.",0,
34123499,ML-SIM: universal reconstruction of structured illumination microscopy images using transfer learning.,"Structured illumination microscopy (SIM) has become an important technique for optical super-resolution imaging because it allows a doubling of image resolution at speeds compatible with live-cell imaging. However, the reconstruction of SIM images is often slow, prone to artefacts, and requires multiple parameter adjustments to reflect different hardware or experimental conditions. Here, we introduce a versatile reconstruction method, ML-SIM, which makes use of transfer learning to obtain a parameter-free model that generalises beyond the task of reconstructing data recorded by a specific imaging system for a specific sample type. We demonstrate the generality of the model and the high quality of the obtained reconstructions by application of ML-SIM on raw data obtained for multiple sample types acquired on distinct SIM microscopes. ML-SIM is an end-to-end deep residual neural network that is trained on an auxiliary domain consisting of simulated images, but is transferable to the target task of reconstructing experimental SIM images. By generating the training data to reflect challenging imaging conditions encountered in real systems, ML-SIM becomes robust to noise and irregularities in the illumination patterns of the raw SIM input frames. Since ML-SIM does not require the acquisition of experimental training data, the method can be efficiently adapted to any specific experimental SIM implementation. We compare the reconstruction quality enabled by ML-SIM with current state-of-the-art SIM reconstruction methods and demonstrate advantages in terms of generality and robustness to noise for both simulated and experimental inputs, thus making ML-SIM a useful alternative to traditional methods for challenging imaging conditions. Additionally, reconstruction of a SIM stack is accomplished in less than 200 ms on a modern graphics processing unit, enabling future applications for real-time imaging. Source code and ready-to-use software for the method are available at http://ML-SIM.github.io.",0,

We demonstrate that different strategies of integrating probing data with thermodynamics-based RNA secondary structure prediction algorithms can be implemented by means of soft constraints. This amounts to incorporating suitable pseudo-energies into the standard energy model for RNA secondary structures. As a showcase application for this new feature of the ViennaRNA Package we compare three distinct, previously published strategies to utilize SHAPE reactivities for structure prediction. The new tool is benchmarked on a set of RNAs with known reference structure.<h4>Availability and implementation</h4>The capability for SHAPE directed RNA folding is part of the upcoming release of the ViennaRNA Package 2.2, for which a preliminary release is already freely available at http://www.tbi.univie.ac.at/RNA.<h4>Contact</h4>michael.wolfinger@univie.ac.at<h4>Supplementary information</h4>Supplementary data are available at Bioinformatics online.",0,
33587706,StructADMM: Achieving Ultrahigh Efficiency in Structured Pruning for DNNs.,"Weight pruning methods of deep neural networks (DNNs) have been demonstrated to achieve a good model pruning rate without loss of accuracy, thereby alleviating the significant computation/storage requirements of large-scale DNNs. Structured weight pruning methods have been proposed to overcome the limitation of irregular network structure and demonstrated actual GPU acceleration. However, in prior work, the pruning rate (degree of sparsity) and GPU acceleration are limited (to less than 50%) when accuracy needs to be maintained. In this work, we overcome these limitations by proposing a unified, systematic framework of structured weight pruning for DNNs. It is a framework that can be used to induce different types of structured sparsity, such as filterwise, channelwise, and shapewise sparsity, as well as nonstructured sparsity. The proposed framework incorporates stochastic gradient descent (SGD; or ADAM) with alternating direction method of multipliers (ADMM) and can be understood as a dynamic regularization method in which the regularization target is analytically updated in each iteration. Leveraging special characteristics of ADMM, we further propose a progressive, multistep weight pruning framework and a network purification and unused path removal procedure, in order to achieve higher pruning rate without accuracy loss. Without loss of accuracy on the AlexNet model, we achieve 2.58x and 3.65x average measured speedup on two GPUs, clearly outperforming the prior work. The average speedups reach 3.15x and 8.52x when allowing a moderate accuracy loss of 2%. In this case, the model compression for convolutional layers is 15.0x, corresponding to 11.93x measured CPU speedup. As another example, for the ResNet-18 model on the CIFAR-10 data set, we achieve an unprecedented 54.2x structured pruning rate on CONV layers. This is 32x higher pruning rate compared with recent work and can further translate into 7.6x inference time speedup on the Adreno 640 mobile GPU compared with the original, unpruned DNN model.

21896882,Functional network construction in Arabidopsis using rule-based machine learning on large-scale data sets.,"The meta-analysis of large-scale postgenomics data sets within public databases promises to provide important novel biological knowledge. Statistical approaches including correlation analyses in coexpression studies of gene expression have emerged as tools to elucidate gene function using these data sets. Here, we present a powerful and novel alternative methodology to computationally identify functional relationships between genes from microarray data sets using rule-based machine learning. This approach, termed ""coprediction,"" is based on the collective ability of groups of genes co-occurring within rules to accurately predict the developmental outcome of a biological system. We demonstrate the utility of coprediction as a powerful analytical tool using publicly available microarray data generated exclusively from Arabidopsis thaliana seeds to compute a functional gene interaction network, termed Seed Co-Prediction Network (SCoPNet). SCoPNet predicts functional associations between genes acting in the same developmental and signal transduction pathways irrespective of the similarity in their respective gene expression patterns. Using SCoPNet, we identified four novel regulators of seed germination (ALTERED SEED GERMINATION5, 6, 7, and 8), and predicted interactions at the level of transcript abundance between these novel and previously described factors influencing Arabidopsis seed germination. An online Web tool to query SCoPNet has been developed as a community resource to dissect seed biology and is available at http://www.vseed.nottingham.ac.uk/.",0,
26908244,CERAPP: Collaborative Estrogen Receptor Activity Prediction Project.,"<h4>Background</h4>Humans are exposed to thousands of man-made chemicals in the environment. Some chemicals mimic natural endocrine hormones and, thus, have the potential to be endocrine disruptors. Most of these chemicals have never been tested for their ability to interact with the estrogen receptor (ER). Risk assessors need tools to prioritize chemicals for evaluation in costly in vivo tests, for instance, within the U.S. EPA Endocrine Disruptor Screening Program.<h4>Objectives</h4>We describe a large-scale modeling project called CERAPP (Collaborative Estrogen Receptor Activity Prediction Project) and demonstrate the efficacy of using predictive computational models trained on high-throughput screening data to evaluate thousands of chemicals for ER-related activity and prioritize them for further testing.<h4>Methods</h4>CERAPP combined multiple models developed in collaboration with 17 groups in the United States and Europe to predict ER activity of a common set of 32,464 chemical structures. Quantitative structure-activity relationship models and docking approaches were employed, mostly using a common training set of 1,677 chemical structures provided by the U.S. EPA, to build a total of 40 categorical and 8 continuous models for binding, agonist, and antagonist ER activity. All predictions were evaluated on a set of 7,522 chemicals curated from the literature. To overcome the limitations of single models, a consensus was built by weighting models on scores based on their evaluated accuracies.<h4>Results</h4>Individual model scores ranged from 0.69 to 0.85, showing high prediction reliabilities. Out of the 32,464 chemicals, the consensus model predicted 4,001 chemicals (12.3%) as high priority actives and 6,742 potential actives (20.8%) to be considered for further testing.<h4>Conclusion</h4>This project demonstrated the possibility to screen large libraries of chemicals using a consensus of different in silico approaches. This concept will be applied in future projects related to other end points.<h4>Citation</h4>Mansouri K, Abdelaziz A, Rybacka A, Roncaglioni A, Tropsha A, Varnek A, Zakharov A, Worth A, Richard AM, Grulke CM, Trisciuzzi D, Fourches D, Horvath D, Benfenati E, Muratov E, Wedebye EB, Grisoni F, Mangiatordi GF, Incisivo GM, Hong H, Ng HW, Tetko IV, Balabin I, Kancherla J, Shen J, Burton J, Nicklaus M, Cassotti M, Nikolov NG, Nicolotti O, Andersson PL, Zang Q, Politi R, Beger RD, Todeschini R, Huang R, Farag S, Rosenberg SA, Slavov S, Hu X, Judson RS. 2016.<h4>Cerapp</h4>Collaborative Estrogen Receptor Activity Prediction Project.

Physical impairment was measured using the Physical Component Summary (PCS) score of the Short-Form 36-Item Health Survey (SF-36) three-component model (using Japanese norms). Older T2DM patients (=65 years old; <i>n</i> = 1511) were dichotomized into physically impaired (PCS = 25th percentile; <i>n</i> = 378) and non-physically impaired (PCS > 25th percentile; <i>n</i> = 1133). Work productivity (absenteeism, presenteeism and overall work impairment), activity impairment and healthcare resource utilization were compared between these groups.<h4>Results</h4>Age, female sex, low and high body mass index (BMI), diabetes-related complications, cardiovascular events, unawareness of having hypoglycemic events in the past 3 months, and lack of regular exercise were significant factors associated with physical impairment in multivariable analysis. The physically impaired group reported significantly more regular outpatient visits (13.48 vs. 10.16, respectively, <i>p</i> < .001), 1% or greater absenteeism (16.7% vs. 4.1%, <i>p</i> = .005), greater presenteeism (27.8% vs. 12.2%, <i>p</i> = .001), overall work impairment (30.0% vs. 13.0%, <i>p</i> = .001) and overall activity impairment (39.5% vs. 17.2%, <i>p <</i> .001) than the non-physically-impaired group after adjusting for covariates.<h4>Conclusions</h4>This study identified age, BMI, diabetes-related comorbidities, history of cardiovascular events and lack of exercise as key predictors associated with physical impairment in older patients with T2DM in Japan, which predicted low work productivity as well as activity impairment. This study provides support that physical impairment in patients with T2DM may lead to low work productivity and activity impairment.Supplemental data for this article is available online at https://doi.org/10.1080/03007995.2020.1846170.",0,
22102885,"Novel SSR markers from BAC-end sequences, DArT arrays and a comprehensive genetic map with 1,291 marker loci for chickpea (Cicer arietinum L.).","Chickpea (Cicer arietinum L.) is the third most important cool season food legume, cultivated in arid and semi-arid regions of the world. The goal of this study was to develop novel molecular markers such as microsatellite or simple sequence repeat (SSR) markers from bacterial artificial chromosome (BAC)-end sequences (BESs) and diversity arrays technology (DArT) markers, and to construct a high-density genetic map based on recombinant inbred line (RIL) population ICC 4958 (C. arietinum)◊PI 489777 (C. reticulatum). A BAC-library comprising 55,680 clones was constructed and 46,270 BESs were generated. Mining of these BESs provided 6,845 SSRs, and primer pairs were designed for 1,344 SSRs. In parallel, DArT arrays with ca. 15,000 clones were developed, and 5,397 clones were found polymorphic among 94 genotypes tested. Screening of newly developed BES-SSR markers and DArT arrays on the parental genotypes of the RIL mapping population showed polymorphism with 253 BES-SSR markers and 675 DArT markers. Segregation data obtained for these polymorphic markers and 494 markers data compiled from published reports or collaborators were used for constructing the genetic map. As a result, a comprehensive genetic map comprising 1,291 markers on eight linkage groups (LGs) spanning a total of 845.56 cM distance was developed (http://cmap.icrisat.ac.in/cmap/sm/cp/thudi/). The number of markers per linkage group ranged from 68 (LG 8) to 218 (LG 3) with an average inter-marker distance of 0.65 cM. While the developed resource of molecular markers will be useful for genetic diversity, genetic mapping and molecular breeding applications, the comprehensive genetic map with integrated BES-SSR markers will facilitate its anchoring to the physical map (under construction) to accelerate map-based cloning of genes in chickpea and comparative genome evolution studies in legumes.",1,

It is indexed by NeuroNames, an ontology designed to compensate for ambiguities in neuroanatomical nomenclature. The 20-year old ontology continues to evolve toward the ideal of recognizing all names of neuroanatomical entities and accommodating all structural concepts about which neuroscientists communicate, including multiple concepts of entities for which neuroanatomists have yet to determine the best or 'true' conceptualization. To make the definitions of structural concepts unambiguous and terminologically consistent we created a 'default vocabulary' of unique structure names selected from existing terminology. We selected standard names by criteria designed to maximize practicality for use in verbal communication as well as computerized knowledge management. The ontology of NeuroNames accommodates synonyms and homonyms of the standard terms in many languages. It defines complex structures as models composed of primary structures, which are defined in unambiguous operational terms. NeuroNames currently relates more than 16,000 names in eight languages to some 2,500 neuroanatomical concepts. The ontology is maintained in a relational database with three core tables: Names, Concepts and Models. BrainInfo uses NeuroNames to index information by structure, to interpret users' queries and to clarify terminology on remote web pages. NeuroNames is a resource vocabulary of the NLM's Unified Medical Language System (UMLS, 2011) and the basis for the brain regions component of NIFSTD (NeuroLex, 2011). The current version has been downloaded to hundreds of laboratories for indexing data and linking to BrainInfo, which attracts some 400 visitors/day, downloading 2,000 pages/day.",0,
25855811,SANSparallel: interactive homology search against Uniprot.,"Proteins evolve by mutations and natural selection. The network of sequence similarities is a rich source for mining homologous relationships that inform on protein structure and function. There are many servers available to browse the network of homology relationships but one has to wait up to a minute for results. The SANSparallel webserver provides protein sequence database searches with immediate response and professional alignment visualization by third-party software. The output is a list, pairwise alignment or stacked alignment of sequence-similar proteins from Uniprot, UniRef90/50, Swissprot or Protein Data Bank. The stacked alignments are viewed in Jalview or as sequence logos. The database search uses the suffix array neighborhood search (SANS) method, which has been re-implemented as a client-server, improved and parallelized. The method is extremely fast and as sensitive as BLAST above 50% sequence identity. Benchmarks show that the method is highly competitive compared to previously published fast database search programs: UBLAST, DIAMOND, LAST, LAMBDA, RAPSEARCH2 and BLAT. The web server can be accessed interactively or programmatically at http://ekhidna2.biocenter.helsinki.fi/cgi-bin/sans/sans.cgi.

29297283,R3D-BLAST2: an improved search tool for similar RNA 3D substructures.,"BACKGROUND:RNA molecules have been known to play a variety of significant roles in cells. In principle, the functions of RNAs are largely determined by their three-dimensional (3D) structures. As more and more RNA 3D structures are available in the Protein Data Bank (PDB), a bioinformatics tool, which is able to rapidly and accurately search the PDB database for similar RNA 3D structures or substructures, is helpful to understand the structural and functional relationships of RNAs. RESULTS:Since its first release in 2011, R3D-BLAST has become a useful tool for searching the PDB database for similar RNA 3D structures and substructures. It was implemented by a structural-alphabet (SA)-based method, which utilizes an SA with 23 structural letters to encode RNA 3D structures into one-dimensional (1D) structural sequences and applies BLAST to the resulting structural sequences for searching similar substructures of RNAs. In this study, we have upgraded R3D-BLAST to develop a new web server named R3D-BLAST2 based on a higher quality SA newly constructed from a representative and sufficiently non-redundant list of RNA 3D structures. In addition, we have modified the kernel program in R3D-BLAST2 so that it can accept an RNA structure in the mmCIF format as an input. The results of our experiments on a benchmark dataset have demonstrated that R3D-BLAST2 indeed performs very well in comparison to its earlier version R3D-BLAST and other similar tools RNA FRABASE, FASTR3D and RAG-3D by searching a larger number of RNA 3D substructures resembling those of the input RNA.

The stored data are interlinked with available UniProt annotation data mapping known mutation effects to channel-lining residues. All structures with channels are displayed in a clear interactive manner, further facilitating data manipulation and interpretation. As such, ChannelsDB provides an invaluable resource for research related to deciphering the biological function of biomacromolecular channels.",1,
30783000,Doravirine and the Potential for CYP3A-Mediated Drug-Drug Interactions.,"Identifying and understanding potential drug-drug interactions (DDIs) are vital for the treatment of human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) infection. This article discusses DDIs between doravirine, a nonnucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor (NNRTI), and cytochrome P450 3A (CYP3A) substrates and drugs that modulate CYP3A activity. Consistent with previously published <i>in vitro</i> data and DDI trials with the CYP3A substrates midazolam and atorvastatin, doravirine did not have any meaningful impact on the pharmacokinetics of the CYP3A substrates ethinyl estradiol and levonorgestrel. Coadministration of doravirine with CYP3A inhibitors (ritonavir or ketoconazole) increased doravirine exposure approximately 3-fold. However, these increases were not considered clinically meaningful. Conversely, previously published trials showed that coadministered CYP3A inducers (rifampin and rifabutin) decreased doravirine exposure by 88% and 50%, respectively (K. L. Yee, S. G. Khalilieh, R. I. Sanchez, R. Liu, et al., Clin Drug Investig 37:659-667, 2017 [https://doi.org/10.1007/s40261-017-0513-4]; S. G. Khalilieh, K. L. Yee, R. I. Sanchez, R. Liu, et al., J Clin Pharmacol 58:1044-1052, 2018 [https://doi.org/10.1002/jcph.1103]), while doravirine exposure following prior efavirenz administration led to an initial reduction in doravirine exposure of 62%, but the reduction became less pronounced with time (K. L. Yee, R. I. Sanchez, P. Auger, R. Liu, et al., Antimicrob Agents Chemother 61:e01757-16, 2017 [https://doi.org/10.1128/AAC.01757-16]). Overall, the coadministration of doravirine with CYP3A inhibitors and substrates is, therefore, supported by these data together with efficacy and safety data from clinical trials, while coadministration with strong CYP3A inducers, such as rifampin, cannot be recommended. Concomitant dosing with rifabutin (a CYP3A inducer less potent than rifampin) is acceptable if doravirine dosing is adjusted from once to twice daily; however, the effect of other moderate inducers on doravirine pharmacokinetics is unknown.",0,
26753561,iMiRNA-SSF: Improving the Identification of MicroRNA Precursors by Combining Negative Sets with Different Distributions.,"The identification of microRNA precursors (pre-miRNAs) helps in understanding regulator in biological processes. The performance of computational predictors depends on their training sets, in which the negative sets play an important role. In this regard, we investigated the influence of benchmark datasets on the predictive performance of computational predictors in the field of miRNA identification, and found that the negative samples have significant impact on the predictive results of various methods. We constructed a new benchmark set with different data distributions of negative samples. Trained with this high quality benchmark dataset, a new computational predictor called iMiRNA-SSF was proposed, which employed various features extracted from RNA sequences. Experimental results showed that iMiRNA-SSF outperforms three state-of-the-art computational methods. For practical applications, a web-server of iMiRNA-SSF was established at the website http://bioinformatics.hitsz.edu.cn/iMiRNA-SSF/.",0,
27502039,Fascin Is Critical for the Maintenance of Breast Cancer Stem Cell Pool Predominantly via the Activation of the Notch Self-Renewal Pathway.,"An emerging dogma shows that tumors are initiated and maintained by a subpopulation of cancer cells that hijack some stem cell features and thus referred to as ""cancer stem cells"" (CSCs). The exact mechanism that regulates the maintenance of CSC pool remains largely unknown. Fascin is an actin-bundling protein that we have previously demonstrated to be a major regulator of breast cancer chemoresistance and metastasis, two cardinal features of CSCs. Here, we manipulated fascin expression in breast cancer cell lines and used several in vitro and in vivo approaches to examine the relationship between fascin expression and breast CSCs. Fascin knockdown significantly reduced stem cell-like phenotype (CD44<sup>hi</sup> /CD24<sup>lo</sup> and ALDH<sup>+</sup> ) and reversal of epithelial to mesenchymal transition. Interestingly, expression of the embryonic stem cell transcriptional factors (Oct4, Nanog, Sox2, and Klf4) was significantly reduced when fascin expression was down-regulated. Functionally, fascin-knockdown cells were less competent in forming colonies and tumorspheres, consistent with lower basal self-renewal activity and higher susceptibility to chemotherapy. Fascin effect on CSC chemoresistance and self-renewability was associated with Notch signaling. Activation of Notch induced the relevant downstream targets predominantly in the fascin-positive cells. Limiting-dilution xenotransplantation assay showed higher frequency of tumor-initiating cells in the fascin-positive group. Collectively, our data demonstrated fascin as a critical regulator of breast CSC pool at least partially via activation of the Notch self-renewal signaling pathway and modification of the expression embryonic transcriptional factors. Targeting fascin may halt CSCs and thus presents a novel therapeutic approach for effective treatment of breast cancer.

This article focuses on the updates to BioGPS since our last paper (2013 database issue). The unique features of BioGPS, compared to those of other gene portals, are its community extensibility and user customizability. Users contribute the gene-specific resources accessible from BioGPS ('plugins'), which helps ensure that the resource collection is always up-to-date and that it will continue expanding over time (since the 2013 paper, 162 resources have been added, for a 34% increase in the number of resources available). BioGPS users can create their own collections of relevant plugins and save them as customized gene-report pages or 'layouts' (since the 2013 paper, 488 user-created layouts have been added, for a 22% increase in the number of layouts). In addition, we recently updated the most popular plugin, the 'Gene expression/activity chart', to include ~ 6000 datasets (from ~ 2000 datasets) and we enhanced user interactivity. We also added a new 'gene list' feature that allows users to save query results for future reference.",1,
PMC6666854,"PSIV-13 Basal endogenous loss, standardized total tract digestibility, and retention of Ca in sows change throughout gestation, but microbial phytase reduces basal endogenous loss of Ca by gestating sows","Abstract The objective was to test the hypothesis that standardized total tract digestibility (STTD) of Ca and Ca and P retention and the response to microbial phytase in diets fed to sows are constant throughout gestation. Thirty-six sows (parity = 3.3) were allotted to 4 diets on d 7 post-breeding. Two corn-based diets in which calcium carbonate was the sole source of Ca and 2 Ca-free diets were formulated without or with phytase (500 units per kg). Sows were housed individually in metabolism crates during early-gestation, mid-gestation, and late-gestation, and feces and urine were quantitatively collected. Data were analyzed by repeated measures using a model that included phytase, period of gestation, and the interaction between phytase and period as fixed effects, and block and replicate as random effects. Interactions between period and phytase were not observed. The basal endogenous loss (BEL) of Ca was greater (P < 0.05) in early-gestation than in mid- and late-gestation, but phytase reduced (P = 0.002) BEL of Ca and tended (P = 0.099) to increase apparent total tract digestibility (ATTD) of P in the Ca-free diet. Phytase did not affect ATTD of DM, STTD of Ca, ATTD of P, or Ca and P retention in sows fed the diet containing calcium carbonate (Table 1). The ATTD of DM was not affected by period, but Ca retention and ATTD of Ca and P were least (P < 0.05) in mid-gestation, followed by early- and late-gestation, and the STTD of Ca in mid-gestation was also reduced (P < 0.05) compared with early- or late-gestation. Phosphorus retention was greater (P < 0.05) in late-gestation than in the earlier periods. In conclusion, BEL of Ca, STTD of Ca, ATTD of P, and Ca and P retention in sows change throughout gestation regardless of use of phytase.  http://www.conferenceharvester.com/",0,
21249531,The DIADEM data sets: representative light microscopy images of neuronal morphology to advance automation of digital reconstructions.,"The comprehensive characterization of neuronal morphology requires tracing extensive axonal and dendritic arbors imaged with light microscopy into digital reconstructions. Considerable effort is ongoing to automate this greatly labor-intensive and currently rate-determining process. Experimental data in the form of manually traced digital reconstructions and corresponding image stacks play a vital role in developing increasingly more powerful reconstruction algorithms. The DIADEM challenge (short for DIgital reconstruction of Axonal and DEndritic Morphology) successfully stimulated progress in this area by utilizing six data set collections from different animal species, brain regions, neuron types, and visualization methods. The original research projects that provided these data are representative of the diverse scientific questions addressed in this field. At the same time, these data provide a benchmark for the types of demands automated software must meet to achieve the quality of manual reconstructions while minimizing human involvement. The DIADEM data underwent extensive curation, including quality control, metadata annotation, and format standardization, to focus the challenge on the most substantial technical obstacles. This data set package is now freely released ( http://diademchallenge.org ) to train, test, and aid development of automated reconstruction algorithms.",1,
31112286,Urinary tract infection prevention after midurethral slings in pelvic floor reconstructive surgery: A systematic review and meta-analysis.,"INTRODUCTION:Synthetic midurethral slings are the most common procedures currently performed for stress urinary incontinence in women. Infection is a frequent complication of urogynecologic surgery. We performed a systematic review and meta-analysis to identify interventions that successfully prevent infections, including urinary tract infection (UTI) and/or bacteriuria, compared with no intervention, in women undergoing midurethral sling surgery with or without concomitant pelvic reconstructive procedures for prolapse. MATERIAL AND METHODS:The primary outcome was the development of any infection post-midurethral sling placement in women. MEDLINE, Embase, CINAHL and the Cochrane Library were searched for comparative studies from inception to July 2017, with no language restrictions. We used search terms related to midurethral sling, infections and infection-reduction interventions. Two independent reviewers abstracted data and assessed study quality. Pooled effect size estimates were calculated. We conducted meta-analysis of eligible studies. A protocol for this review has been registered and can be accessed online (http://hdl.handle.net/2429/64731). RESULTS:We identified seven eligible studies of infection risk-reducing interventions; all focused on UTIs. Only one study assessed preoperative antibiotics with midurethral sling alone and was halted early because of low UTI rates. All other studies (three randomized control trials and three observational studies) examined whether postoperative antibiotics decrease UTI/bacteriuria rates after midurethral sling with or without reconstructive procedures for pelvic organ prolapse and using bladder catheterization postoperatively. Due to considerable clinical heterogeneity, we only combined four studies for meta-analysis. Postoperative oral prophylactic nitrofurantoin showed no significant benefit in reducing UTI/bacteriuria in women post-midurethral sling with or without concomitant reconstructive pelvic surgery and the need for bladder catheterization, when compared with the reference group (pooled relative risk 0.73, 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.42-1.25). CONCLUSIONS:Based on the best available evidence, postoperative oral nitrofurantoin is not effective at reducing UTI/bacteriuria rates in catheterized women after midurethral sling with or without concomitant pelvic reconstructive surgery for prolapse. For midurethral sling alone, preoperative antibiotic prophylaxis may not be needed for UTI prevention.",0,
30476000,Integrate multiple traits to detect novel trait-gene association using GWAS summary data with an adaptive test approach.,"<h4>Motivation</h4>Genetics hold great promise to precision medicine by tailoring treatment to the individual patient based on their genetic profiles. Toward this goal, many large-scale genome-wide association studies (GWAS) have been performed in the last decade to identify genetic variants associated with various traits and diseases. They have successfully identified tens of thousands of disease-related variants. However they have explained only a small proportion of the overall trait heritability for most traits and are of very limited clinical use. This is partly owing to the small effect sizes of most genetic variants, and the common practice of testing association between one trait and one genetic variant at a time in most GWAS, even when multiple related traits are often measured for each individual. Increasing evidence suggests that many genetic variants can influence multiple traits simultaneously, and we can gain more power by testing association of multiple traits simultaneously. It is appealing to develop novel multi-trait association test methods that need only GWAS summary data, since it is generally very hard to access the individual-level GWAS phenotype and genotype data.<h4>Results</h4>Many existing GWAS summary data-based association test methods have relied on ad hoc approach or crude Monte Carlo approximation. In this article, we develop rigorous statistical methods for efficient and powerful multi-trait association test. We develop robust and efficient methods to accurately estimate the marginal trait correlation matrix using only GWAS summary data. We construct the principal component (PC)-based association test from the summary statistics. PC-based test has optimal power when the underlying multi-trait signal can be captured by the first PC, and otherwise it will have suboptimal performance. We develop an adaptive test by optimally weighting the PC-based test and the omnibus chi-square test to achieve robust performance under various scenarios. We develop efficient numerical algorithms to compute the analytical P-values for all the proposed tests without the need of Monte Carlo sampling. We illustrate the utility of proposed methods through application to the GWAS meta-analysis summary data for multiple lipids and glycemic traits. We identify multiple novel loci that were missed by individual trait-based association test.<h4>Availability and implementation</h4>All the proposed methods are implemented in an R package available at http://www.github.com/baolinwu/MTAR. The developed R programs are extremely efficient: it takes less than 2 min to compute the list of genome-wide significant single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) for all proposed multi-trait tests for the lipids GWAS summary data with 2.5 million SNPs on a single Linux desktop.<h4>Supplementary information</h4>Supplementary data are available at Bioinformatics online.",0,

It is the hope that this Guideline becomes a reference for effective evidence-based surgical management of LUTS/BPH.<h4>Materials and methods</h4>The evidence team searched Ovid MEDLINE, the Cochrane Library, and the Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality database to identify studies indexed between January 2007-September 2017. Following initial publication, this guideline was amended in 2019 and reflects relevant literature published through January 2019.

28886603,Review of Epidemiological Studies of Drinking-Water Turbidity in Relation to Acute Gastrointestinal Illness.,"<h4>Background</h4>Turbidity has been used as an indicator of microbiological contamination of drinking water in time-series studies attempting to discern the presence of waterborne gastrointestinal illness; however, the utility of turbidity as a proxy exposure measure has been questioned.<h4>Objectives</h4>We conducted a review of epidemiological studies of the association between turbidity of drinking-water supplies and incidence of acute gastrointestinal illness (AGI), including a synthesis of the overall weight of evidence. Our goal was to evaluate the potential for causal inference from the studies.<h4>Methods</h4>We identified 14 studies on the topic (distinct by region, time period and/or population). We evaluated each study with regard to modeling approaches, potential biases, and the strength of evidence. We also considered consistencies and differences in the collective results.<h4>Discussion</h4>Positive associations between drinking-water turbidity and AGI incidence were found in different cities and time periods, and with both unfiltered and filtered supplies. There was some evidence for a stronger association at higher turbidity levels. The studies appeared to adequately adjust for confounding. There was fair consistency in the notable lags between turbidity measurement and AGI identification, which fell between 6 and 10 d in many studies.<h4>Conclusions</h4>The observed associations suggest a detectable incidence of waterborne AGI from drinking water in the systems and time periods studied. However, some discrepant results indicate that the association may be context specific. Combining turbidity with seasonal and climatic factors, additional water quality measures, and treatment data may enhance predictive modeling in future studies. https://doi.org/10.1289/EHP1090.",0,

This changing technology may open new avenues to foster mentoring in medicine. DESIGN, SYSTEMATIC REVIEW, MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: A search of the MEDLINE database from 1950 to 2012 using the PubMed interface, combined with manual cross-referencing was performed using the following strategy: (""mentors""[MeSH Terms] OR ""mentors""[All Fields] OR ""mentor""[All Fields]) AND (""internet""[MeSH Terms] OR ""internet""[All Fields]) AND (""medicine""[MeSH Terms] OR ""medicine""[All Fields]) AND (""humans""[MeSH Terms] AND English[lang]). Abstracts were screened for relevance (UJ) to the topic; eligibility for inclusion was simply on screening for relevance to online mentoring and web-based technologies.<h4>Results</h4>Forty-five papers were found, of which 16 were relevant. All studies were observational in nature. To date, all medical mentoring applications utilizing the World Wide Web have enjoyed some success limited by Web 1.0 and 2.0 technologies.<h4>Conclusions</h4>With the evolution of the WWW through 1.0, 2.0 and 3.0 generations, the potential for meaningful tele- and distance mentoring has greatly improved.

21857117,Eu-Detect: an algorithm for detecting eukaryotic sequences in metagenomic data sets.,"Physical partitioning techniques are routinely employed (during sample preparation stage) for segregating the prokaryotic and eukaryotic fractions of metagenomic samples. In spite of these efforts, several metagenomic studies focusing on bacterial and archaeal populations have reported the presence of contaminating eukaryotic sequences in metagenomic data sets. Contaminating sequences originate not only from genomes of micro-eukaryotic species but also from genomes of (higher) eukaryotic host cells. The latter scenario usually occurs in the case of host-associated metagenomes. Identification and removal of contaminating sequences is important, since these sequences not only impact estimates of microbial diversity but also affect the accuracy of several downstream analyses. Currently, the computational techniques used for identifying contaminating eukaryotic sequences, being alignment based, are slow, inefficient, and require huge computing resources. In this article, we present Eu-Detect, an alignment-free algorithm that can rapidly identify eukaryotic sequences contaminating metagenomic data sets. Validation results indicate that on a desktop with modest hardware specifications, the Eu-Detect algorithm is able to rapidly segregate DNA sequence fragments of prokaryotic and eukaryotic origin, with high sensitivity.

29806693,Neuronal calcineurin transcriptional targets parallel changes observed in Alzheimer disease brain.,"Synaptic dysfunction and loss are core pathological features in Alzheimer disease (AD). In the vicinity of amyloid-ﬂ plaques in animal models, synaptic toxicity occurs and is associated with chronic activation of the phosphatase calcineurin (CN). Indeed, pharmacological inhibition of CN blocks amyloid-ﬂ synaptotoxicity. We therefore hypothesized that CN-mediated transcriptional changes may contribute to AD neuropathology and tested this by examining the impact of CN over-expression on neuronal gene expression in†vivo. We found dramatic transcriptional down-regulation, especially of synaptic mRNAs, in neurons chronically exposed to CN activation. Importantly, the transcriptional profile parallels the changes in human AD tissue. Bioinformatics analyses suggest that both nuclear factor of activated T cells and numerous microRNAs may all be impacted by CN, and†parallel findings are observed in AD. These data and analyses support the hypothesis that at least part of the synaptic failure characterizing AD may result from aberrant CN activation leading to down-regulation of synaptic genes, potentially via activation of specific transcription factors and expression of repressive microRNAs.<h4>Open practices</h4>Open Science: This manuscript was awarded with the Open Materials Badge.

26893301,Clustering Genes of Common Evolutionary History.,"Phylogenetic inference can potentially result in a more accurate tree using data from multiple loci. However, if the loci are incongruent-due to events such as incomplete lineage sorting or horizontal gene transfer-it can be misleading to infer a single tree. To address this, many previous contributions have taken a mechanistic approach, by modeling specific processes. Alternatively, one can cluster loci without assuming how these incongruencies might arise. Such ""process-agnostic"" approaches typically infer a tree for each locus and cluster these. There are, however, many possible combinations of tree distance and clustering methods; their comparative performance in the context of tree incongruence is largely unknown. Furthermore, because standard model selection criteria such as AIC cannot be applied to problems with a variable number of topologies, the issue of inferring the optimal number of clusters is poorly understood. Here, we perform a large-scale simulation study of phylogenetic distances and clustering methods to infer loci of common evolutionary history. We observe that the best-performing combinations are distances accounting for branch lengths followed by spectral clustering or Ward's method. We also introduce two statistical tests to infer the optimal number of clusters and show that they strongly outperform the silhouette criterion, a general-purpose heuristic. We illustrate the usefulness of the approach by 1) identifying errors in a previous phylogenetic analysis of yeast species and 2) identifying topological incongruence among newly sequenced loci of the globeflower fly genus Chiastocheta We release treeCl, a new program to cluster genes of common evolutionary history (http://git.io/treeCl).",0,

29162558,Surgical Interventions for the Treatment of Supracondylar Humerus Fractures in Children: Protocol of a Systematic Review.,"BACKGROUND:The treatment of supracondylar humerus fracture in children (SHFC) is associated with complications such as functional deficit, residual deformity, and iatrogenic neurological damage. The standard treatment is closed reduction and percutaneous Kirschner wire fixation with different configurations. Despite this fact, there is still no consensus on the most effective technique for the treatment of these fractures. OBJECTIVE:The aim of this systematic review will be to evaluate the effect of surgical interventions on the treatment of Gartland type II and III SHFC by assessing function, complications, and error as primary outcomes. Clinical outcomes such as range of motion and pain and radiographic outcomes will also be judged. METHODS:A systematic review of randomized controlled trials or quasi-randomized controlled trials evaluating the surgical treatment of SHFC will be carried out in the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, PubMed, Literatura Latino-Americana e do Caribe em CiÍncias da Sa˙de, and Excerpta Medica Database. The search will also occur at ongoing and recently completed clinical trials in selected databases. Data management and extraction will be performed using a data withdrawal form and by analyzing the following: study method characteristics, participant characteristics, intervention characteristics, results, methodological domains, and risk of bias. To assess the risk of bias of the included trials, the Cochrane Risk of Bias Tool will be used. Dichotomous outcome data will be analyzed as risk ratios, and continuous outcome data will be expressed as mean differences, both with 95% confidence intervals. Also, whenever possible, subgroup analysis, sensitivity analysis, and assessment of heterogeneity will be performed. RESULTS:Following the publication of this protocol, searches will be run and included studies will be deeply analyzed. We hope to obtain final results in the next few months and have the final paper published by the end of 2018. This study was funded by a government-based noncommercial agency, FundaÁ„o de Amparo ‡ Pesquisa do Estado de S„o Paulo (FAPESP). CONCLUSIONS:This study may provide surgical treatment effects evidence for SHFC. The results will assist clinical practice by demonstrating the effectiveness and potential complications of these interventions and might serve as a reference for future clinical trials on the topic.

30611208,Development and validation of a risk score to predict mortality during TB treatment in patients with TB-diabetes comorbidity.,"<h4>Background</h4>Making an accurate prognosis for mortality during tuberculosis (TB) treatment in TB-diabetes (TB-DM) comorbid patients remains a challenge for health professionals, especially in low TB prevalent populations, due to the lack of a standardized prognostic model.<h4>Methods</h4>Using de-identified data from TB-DM patients from Texas, who received TB treatment had a treatment outcome of completed treatment or died before completion, reported to the National TB Surveillance System from January 2010-December 2016, we developed and internally validated a mortality scoring system, based on the regression coefficients.<h4>Results</h4>Of 1227 included TB-DM patients, 112 (9.1%) died during treatment. The score used nine characteristics routinely collected by most TB programs. Patients were divided into three groups based on their score: low-risk (< 12 points), medium-risk (12-21 points) and high-risk (=22 points). The model had good performance (with an area under the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve of 0.83 in development and 0.82 in validation), and good calibration. A practical mobile calculator app was also created ( https://oaa.app.link/Isqia5rN6K ).<h4>Conclusion</h4>Using demographic and clinical characteristics which are available from most TB programs at the patient's initial visits, our simple scoring system had good performance and may be a practical clinical tool for TB health professionals in identifying TB-DM comorbid patients with a high mortality risk.",0,
25886978,Accurate prediction of RNA nucleotide interactions with backbone k-tree model.,"<h4>Motivation</h4>Given the importance of non-coding RNAs to cellular regulatory functions, it would be highly desirable to have accurate computational prediction of RNA 3D structure, a task which remains challenging. Even for a short RNA sequence, the space of tertiary conformations is immense; existing methods to identify native-like conformations mostly resort to random sampling of conformations to achieve computational feasibility. However, native conformations may not be examined and prediction accuracy may be compromised due to sampling. State-of-the-art methods have yet to deliver satisfactory predictions for RNAs of length beyond 50 nucleotides.<h4>Results</h4>This paper presents a method to tackle a key step in the RNA 3D structure prediction problem, the prediction of the nucleotide interactions that constitute the desired 3D structure. The research is based on a novel graph model, called a backbone k-tree, to tightly constrain the nucleotide interaction relationships considered for RNA 3D structures. It is shown that the new model makes it possible to efficiently predict the optimal set of nucleotide interactions (including the non-canonical interactions in all recently revealed families) from the query sequence along with known or predicted canonical basepairs. The preliminary results indicate that in most cases the new method can predict with a high accuracy the nucleotide interactions that constitute the 3D structure of the query sequence. It thus provides a useful tool for the accurate prediction of RNA 3D structure.<h4>Availability and implementation</h4>The source package for BkTree is available at http://rna-informatics.uga.edu/index.php?f=software&p=BkTree.<h4>Contact</h4>lding@uga.edu or cai@cs.uga.edu<h4>Supplementary information</h4>Supplementary data are available at Bioinformatics online.",0,
32700975,Cytotoxicity Burst? Differentiating Specific from Nonspecific Effects in Tox21 <i>in Vitro</i> Reporter Gene Assays.,"<h4>Background</h4>High-throughput screening of chemicals with <i>in vitro</i> reporter gene assays in Tox21 has produced a large database on cytotoxicity and specific modes of action. However, the validity of some of the reported activities is questionable due to the ""cytotoxicity burst,"" which refers to the supposition that many stress responses are activated in a nonspecific way at concentrations close to cell death.<h4>Objectives</h4>We propose a pragmatic method to identify whether reporter gene activation is specific or cytotoxicity-triggered by comparing the measured effects with baseline toxicity.<h4>Methods</h4>Baseline toxicity, also termed narcosis, is the minimal toxicity any chemical causes. Quantitative structure-activity relationships (QSARs) developed for baseline toxicity in mammalian reporter gene cell lines served as anchors to define the chemical-specific threshold for the cytotoxicity burst and to evaluate the degree of specificity of the reporter gene activation. Measured 10% effect concentrations were related to measured or QSAR-predicted 10% cytotoxicity concentrations yielding specificity ratios (SR). We applied this approach to our own experimental data and to ~8,000 chemicals that were tested in six of the high-throughput Tox21 reporter gene assays.<h4>Results</h4>Confirmed baseline toxicants activated reporter gene activity around cytotoxic concentrations triggered by the cytotoxicity burst. In six Tox21 assays, 37%-87% of the active hits were presumably caused by the cytotoxicity burst (SR<1) and only 2%-14% were specific with SR=10 against experimental cytotoxicity but 75%-97% were specific against baseline toxicity. This difference was caused by a large fraction of chemicals showing excess cytotoxicity.<h4>Conclusions</h4>The specificity analysis for measured <i>in vitro</i> effects identified whether a cytotoxicity burst had likely occurred. The SR-analysis not only prevented false positives, but it may also serve as measure for relative effect potency and can be used for quantitative <i>in vitro-in†vivo</i> extrapolation and risk assessment of chemicals. https://doi.org/10.1289/EHP6664.",0,
26635139,An integrative somatic mutation analysis to identify pathways linked with survival outcomes across 19 cancer types.,"<h4>Motivation</h4>Identification of altered pathways that are clinically relevant across human cancers is a key challenge in cancer genomics. Precise identification and understanding of these altered pathways may provide novel insights into patient stratification, therapeutic strategies and the development of new drugs. However, a challenge remains in accurately identifying pathways altered by somatic mutations across human cancers, due to the diverse mutation spectrum. We developed an innovative approach to integrate somatic mutation data with gene networks and pathways, in order to identify pathways altered by somatic mutations across cancers.<h4>Results</h4>We applied our approach to The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) dataset of somatic mutations in 4790 cancer patients with 19 different types of tumors. Our analysis identified cancer-type-specific altered pathways enriched with known cancer-relevant genes and targets of currently available drugs. To investigate the clinical significance of these altered pathways, we performed consensus clustering for patient stratification using member genes in the altered pathways coupled with gene expression datasets from 4870 patients from TCGA, and multiple independent cohorts confirmed that the altered pathways could be used to stratify patients into subgroups with significantly different clinical outcomes. Of particular significance, certain patient subpopulations with poor prognosis were identified because they had specific altered pathways for which there are available targeted therapies. These findings could be used to tailor and intensify therapy in these patients, for whom current therapy is suboptimal.<h4>Availability and implementation</h4>The code is available at: http://www.taehyunlab.org<h4>Contact</h4>jhcheong@yuhs.ac or taehyun.hwang@utsouthwestern.edu or taehyun.cs@gmail.com<h4>Supplementary information</h4>Supplementary data are available at Bioinformatics online.",0,

32978618,Deep learning based prediction of reversible HAT/HDAC-specific lysine acetylation.,"Protein lysine acetylation regulation is an important molecular mechanism for regulating cellular processes and plays critical physiological and pathological roles in cancers and diseases. Although massive acetylation sites have been identified through experimental identification and high-throughput proteomics techniques, their enzyme-specific regulation remains largely unknown. Here, we developed the deep learning-based protein lysine acetylation modification prediction (Deep-PLA) software for histone acetyltransferase (HAT)/histone deacetylase (HDAC)-specific acetylation prediction based on deep learning. Experimentally identified substrates and sites of several HATs and HDACs were curated from the literature to generate enzyme-specific data sets. We integrated various protein sequence features with deep neural network and optimized the hyperparameters with particle swarm optimization, which achieved satisfactory performance. Through comparisons based on cross-validations and testing data sets, the model outperformed previous studies. Meanwhile, we found that protein-protein interactions could enrich enzyme-specific acetylation regulatory relations and visualized this information in the Deep-PLA web server. Furthermore, a cross-cancer analysis of acetylation-associated mutations revealed that acetylation regulation was intensively disrupted by mutations in cancers and heavily implicated in the regulation of cancer signaling. These prediction and analysis results might provide helpful information to reveal the regulatory mechanism of protein acetylation in various biological processes to promote the research on prognosis and treatment of cancers. Therefore, the Deep-PLA predictor and protein acetylation interaction networks could provide helpful information for studying the regulation of protein acetylation. The web server of Deep-PLA could be accessed at http://deeppla.cancerbio.info.",0,
21256977,AskHERMES: An online question answering system for complex clinical questions.,"<h4>Objective</h4>Clinical questions are often long and complex and take many forms. We have built a clinical question answering system named AskHERMES to perform robust semantic analysis on complex clinical questions and output question-focused extractive summaries as answers.<h4>Design</h4>This paper describes the system architecture and a preliminary evaluation of AskHERMES, which implements innovative approaches in question analysis, summarization, and answer presentation. Five types of resources were indexed in this system: MEDLINE abstracts, PubMed Central full-text articles, eMedicine documents, clinical guidelines and Wikipedia articles.<h4>Measurement</h4>We compared the AskHERMES system with Google (Google and Google Scholar) and UpToDate and asked physicians to score the three systems by ease of use, quality of answer, time spent, and overall performance.<h4>Results</h4>AskHERMES allows physicians to enter a question in a natural way with minimal query formulation and allows physicians to efficiently navigate among all the answer sentences to quickly meet their information needs. In contrast, physicians need to formulate queries to search for information in Google and UpToDate. The development of the AskHERMES system is still at an early stage, and the knowledge resource is limited compared with Google or UpToDate. Nevertheless, the evaluation results show that AskHERMES' performance is comparable to the other systems. In particular, when answering complex clinical questions, it demonstrates the potential to outperform both Google and UpToDate systems.<h4>Conclusions</h4>AskHERMES, available at http://www.AskHERMES.org, has the potential to help physicians practice evidence-based medicine and improve the quality of patient care.",0,

We present a web patient empowering system (PHSP4) that ensures continuous monitoring and assessment of the health state of patients with DM (type I and II). PHSP4 is a Knowledge-Based Personal Health System (PHS) which follows the trend of P4 Medicine (Personalized, Predictive, Preventive, and Participative). It provides messages to outpatients and clinicians about the achievement of objectives, follow-up, and treatments adjusted to the patient condition. Additionally, it calculates a four-component risk vector of the associated pathologies with DM: Nephropathy, Diabetic retinopathy, Diabetic foot, and Cardiovascular event. The core of the system is a Rule-Based System which Knowledge Base is composed by a set of rules implementing the recommendations of the American Diabetes Association (ADA) (American Diabetes Association: http://www.diabetes.org/ ) clinical guideline. The PHSP4 is designed to be standardized and to facilitate its interoperability by means of terminologies (SNOMED-CT [The International Health Terminology Standards Development Organization: http://www.ihtsdo.org/snomed-ct/ ] and UCUM [The Unified Code for Units of Measure: http://unitsofmeasure.org/ ]), standardized clinical documents (HL7 CDA R2 [Health Level Seven International: http://www.hl7.org/index.cfm ]) for managing Electronic Health Record (EHR).

30967119,Large-scale 3D chromatin reconstruction from chromosomal contacts.,"<h4>Background</h4>Recent advances in genome analysis have established that chromatin has preferred 3D conformations, which bring distant loci into contact. Identifying these contacts is important for us to understand possible interactions between these loci. This has motivated the creation of the Hi-C technology, which detects long-range chromosomal interactions. Distance geometry-based algorithms, such as ChromSDE and ShRec3D, have been able to utilize Hi-C data to infer 3D chromosomal structures. However, these algorithms, being matrix-based, are space- and time-consuming on very large datasets. A human genome of 100 kilobase resolution would involve ~30,000 loci, requiring gigabytes just in storing the matrices.<h4>Results</h4>We propose a succinct representation of the distance matrices which tremendously reduces the space requirement. We give a complete solution, called SuperRec, for the inference of chromosomal structures from Hi-C data, through iterative solving the large-scale weighted multidimensional scaling problem.<h4>Conclusions</h4>SuperRec runs faster than earlier systems without compromising on result accuracy. The SuperRec package can be obtained from http://www.cs.cityu.edu.hk/~shuaicli/SuperRec .",0,
32541556,Interactive Web Application for Plotting Personalized Prognosis Prediction Curves in Allogeneic Hematopoietic Cell Transplantation Using Machine Learning.,"<h4>Background</h4>Allogeneic hematopoietic cell transplantation (allo-HCT) is a curative treatment option for malignant hematological disorders. Transplant clinicians estimate patient-specific prognosis empirically in clinical practice based on previous studies on similar patients. However, this approach does not provide objective data. The present study primarily aimed to develop a tool capable of providing accurate personalized prognosis prediction after allo-HCT in an objective manner.<h4>Methods</h4>We developed an interactive web application tool with a graphical user interface capable of plotting the personalized survival and cumulative incidence prediction curves after allo-HCT adjusted by 8 patient-specific factors, which are known as prognostic predictors, and assessed their predictive performances. A random survival forest model using the data of patients who underwent allo-HCT at our institution was applied to develop this application.<h4>Results</h4>We succeeded in showing the personalized prognosis prediction curves of 1-year overall survival, progression-free survival, relapse/progression, and nonrelapse mortality (NRM) interactively using our web application (https://predicted-os-after-transplantation.shinyapps.io/RSF_model/). To assess its predictive performance, the entire cohort (363 cases) was split into a training cohort (70%) and a test cohort (30%) time-sequentially based on the patients' transplant dates. The areas under the receiver-operating characteristic curves for 1-year overall survival, progression-free survival, relapse/progression, and nonrelapse mortality in test cohort were 0.70, 0.72, 0.73, and 0.77, respectively.<h4>Conclusions</h4>The new web application could allow transplant clinicians to inform a new allo-HCT candidate of the objective personalized prognosis prediction and facilitate decision-making.",0,
22345505,ANAP: an integrated knowledge base for Arabidopsis protein interaction network analysis.,"Protein interactions are fundamental to the molecular processes occurring within an organism and can be utilized in network biology to help organize, simplify, and understand biological complexity. Currently, there are more than 10 publicly available Arabidopsis (Arabidopsis thaliana) protein interaction databases. However, there are limitations with these databases, including different types of interaction evidence, a lack of defined standards for protein identifiers, differing levels of information, and, critically, a lack of integration between them. In this paper, we present an interactive bioinformatics Web tool, ANAP (Arabidopsis Network Analysis Pipeline), which serves to effectively integrate the different data sets and maximize access to available data. ANAP has been developed for Arabidopsis protein interaction integration and network-based study to facilitate functional protein network analysis. ANAP integrates 11 Arabidopsis protein interaction databases, comprising 201,699 unique protein interaction pairs, 15,208 identifiers (including 11,931 The Arabidopsis Information Resource Arabidopsis Genome Initiative codes), 89 interaction detection methods, 73 species that interact with Arabidopsis, and 6,161 references. ANAP can be used as a knowledge base for constructing protein interaction networks based on user input and supports both direct and indirect interaction analysis. It has an intuitive graphical interface allowing easy network visualization and provides extensive detailed evidence for each interaction. In addition, ANAP displays the gene and protein annotation in the generated interactive network with links to The Arabidopsis Information Resource, the AtGenExpress Visualization Tool, the Arabidopsis 1,001 Genomes GBrowse, the Protein Knowledgebase, the Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes, and the Ensembl Genome Browser to significantly aid functional network analysis.

33064603,Exploring Sentence Diversity at the Boundary of Typical and Impaired Language Abilities.,"Purpose This review article summarizes programmatic research on sentence diversity in toddlers developing language typically and explores developmental patterns of sentence diversity in toddlers at risk for specific language impairment. Method The first half of this review article presents a sentence-focused approach to language assessment and intervention and reviews findings from empirical studies of sentence diversity. In the second half, subject and verb diversity in three simple sentence types are explored in an archival database of toddlers with varying levels of grammatical outcomes at 36 months of age: low average, mild/moderate delay, and severe delay. Results Descriptive findings from the archival database replicated previous developmental patterns. All toddlers with low-average language abilities produced diverse simple sentences by 30 months of age and exhibited greater sentence diversity with first-person <i>I</i>-subjects before third-person subjects. Third-person subject diversity emerged in a developmental sequence, increasing in one-argument copula contexts and one-argument subject-verb sentences before two-argument subject-verb-object sentences. This developmental pattern held across all three outcome groups. Third-person subjects were least diverse for children with severe grammatical delays and were absent in all sentence contexts for two children with severe delays at 36 months. Conclusions Sentence diversity increases gradually and expands in predictable patterns. Understanding these developmental patterns may help identify and treat children who display unexpected difficulty combining different subjects and verbs in flexible ways.

Least absolute shrinkage and selection operator regression was employed to sift variables; subsequently, Cox proportional hazards regression model was built. We applied the enhanced bootstrap validation to appraise the discrimination and calibration of the model. Clinical benefit was measured using decision curve analysis (DCA). Thereafter, a web-based calculator based on the model, which could be used to predict the 1-, 3-, and 5-year OS rates, was developed.<h4>Results</h4>Race, age, histologic type, grade, N stage, and therapeutic methods were selected. C-indices of the prediction model in the training and validation groups were 0.726 (95% confidence interval [CI], 0.679-0.773) and 0.724 (95% CI, 0.679-0.769), respectively. Calibration curves showed good agreement between the groups. The DCA demonstrated that the prediction model is clinically useful.<h4>Conclusions</h4>The prediction model we developed showed a good performance in calculating the OS rates in patients with Stage I EC.

26477251,Spin labeling and Double Electron-Electron Resonance (DEER) to Deconstruct Conformational Ensembles of HIV Protease.,"An understanding of macromolecular conformational equilibrium in biological systems is oftentimes essential to understand function, dysfunction, and disease. For the past few years, our lab has been utilizing site-directed spin labeling (SDSL), coupled with electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) spectroscopy, to characterize the conformational ensemble and ligand-induced conformational shifts of HIV-1 protease (HIV-1PR). The biomedical importance of characterizing the fractional occupancy of states within the conformational ensemble critically impacts our hypothesis of a conformational selection mechanism of drug-resistance evolution in HIV-1PR. The purpose of the following chapter is to give a timeline perspective of our SDSL EPR approach to characterizing conformational sampling of HIV-1PR. We provide detailed instructions for the procedure utilized in analyzing distance profiles for HIV-1PR obtained from pulsed electron-electron double resonance (PELDOR). Specifically, we employ a version of PELDOR known as double electron-electron resonance (DEER). Data are processed with the software package ""DeerAnalysis"" (http://www.epr.ethz.ch/software), which implements Tikhonov regularization (TKR), to generate a distance profile from electron spin-echo amplitude modulations. We assign meaning to resultant distance profiles based upon a conformational sampling model, which is described herein. The TKR distance profiles are reconstructed with a linear combination of Gaussian functions, which is then statistically analyzed. In general, DEER has proven powerful for observing structural ensembles in proteins and, more recently, nucleic acids. Our goal is to present our advances in order to aid readers in similar applications.",0,
25429060,A bio-inspired computing model for ovarian carcinoma classification and oncogene detection.,"<h4>Motivation</h4>Ovarian cancer is the fifth leading cause of cancer deaths in women in the western world for 2013. In ovarian cancer, benign tumors turn malignant, but the point of transition is difficult to predict and diagnose. The 5-year survival rate of all types of ovarian cancer is 44%, but this can be improved to 92% if the cancer is found and treated before it spreads beyond the ovary. However, only 15% of all ovarian cancers are found at this early stage. Therefore, the ability to automatically identify and diagnose ovarian cancer precisely and efficiently as the tissue changes from benign to invasive is important for clinical treatment and for increasing the cure rate. This study proposes a new ovarian carcinoma classification model using two algorithms: a novel discretization of food sources for an artificial bee colony (DfABC), and a support vector machine (SVM). For the first time in the literature, oncogene detection using this method is also investigated.<h4>Results</h4>A novel bio-inspired computing model and hybrid algorithms combining DfABC and SVM was applied to ovarian carcinoma and oncogene classification. This study used the human ovarian cDNA expression database to collect 41 patient samples and 9600 genes in each pathological stage. Feature selection methods were used to detect and extract 15 notable oncogenes. We then used the DfABC-SVM model to examine these 15 oncogenes, dividing them into eight different classifications according to their gene expressions of various pathological stages. The average accuracyof the eight classification experiments was 94.76%. This research also found some oncogenes that had not been discovered or indicated in previous scientific studies. The main contribution of this research is the proof that these newly discovered oncogenes are highly related to ovarian or other cancers.<h4>Availability and implementation</h4>http://mht.mis.nchu.edu.tw/moodle/course/view.php?id=7.",0,

In the article http://dx.doi.org/10.1037/pst0000288), the second to last sentence does not appear correctly and should appear instead as follows: The conclusion emerging from this study is that exploring better moments and building positivity efficiently counters depressive symptoms and builds well-being. (The following abstract of the original article appeared in record 2020-12346-001.) In this qualitative study, we explored the experiences of clients receiving cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) for major depressive disorder. All participants received 8 sessions of traditional CBT (based on Beck, Rush, Shaw, & Emergy, 1979) and 8 sessions of positive CBT (order counterbalanced). The aim of the study was to examine clients' experience of positive CBT and to contrast this with their experience of traditional CBT. Positive CBT structurally and selectively focuses on better moments (exceptions to the problem as opposed to the problem), strengths, and positive emotions and integrates traditional CBT with solution-focused brief therapy and positive psychology. In addition to conducting interviews with 12 individuals, the second author attended all therapy sessions of 4 clients and observed biweekly supervision sessions as further methods of data collection. Qualitative analysis showed that, despite initial skepticism, clients preferred positive CBT and indicated experiencing a steeper learning curve during positive, compared with traditional, CBT for depression. The popularity of positive CBT was attributable to 4 influences: feeling good and empowered, benefitting from upward spiral effects of positive emotions, learning to appreciate baby steps, and (re)discovering optimism as a personal strength. Qualitative analysis showed that, despite better moments and building positivity efficiently counters depressive symptoms and builds well-being. Clients perceived positive CBT's upbeat tone as stimulating and as motivating for change. (PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2020 APA, all rights reserved).",0,
30578582,Sex differences in the circulatory responses to an isocapnic cold pressor test.,"<h4>New findings</h4>What is the central question of this study? Do sex differences exist in the cardiorespiratory responses to an isocapnic cold pressor test (CPT)? What is the main finding and its importance? During the CPT, there were no sex differences in the respiratory response; however, females demonstrated a reduced mean arterial pressure and reduced dilatation of the common carotid artery. Given that the CPT is predictive of future cardiovascular events, these data have clinical implications for improving the utility of the CPT to determine cardiovascular health risk. Sex differences should be taken into consideration when conducting and interpreting a CPT.<h4>Abstract</h4>The cold pressor test (CPT) elicits a transient increase in sympathetic nervous activity, minute ventilation ( <mml:math xmlns:mml=""http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML""> <mml:msub><mml:mover><mml:mi>V</mml:mi> <mml:mo><U+0307></mml:mo></mml:mover> <mml:mi>E</mml:mi></mml:msub> </mml:math> ), mean arterial pressure (MAP) and common carotid artery (CCA) diameter in healthy individuals. Although the extent of dilatation of the CCA in response to the CPT has been used as a clinical indicator of cardiovascular health status, the potential sex differences have yet to be explored. In response to a CPT, we hypothesized that elevations in <mml:math xmlns:mml=""http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML""> <mml:msub><mml:mover><mml:mi>V</mml:mi> <mml:mo><U+0307></mml:mo></mml:mover> <mml:mi>E</mml:mi></mml:msub> </mml:math> and MAP and dilatation of the CCA would be attenuated in females compared with males. In 20 young, healthy participants (10 females), we measured the respiratory, cardiovascular and CCA responses during a CPT, which consisted of a 3†min immersion of the right foot into 0-1 ice water. Blood pressure (via finger photoplethysmography), heart rate (via electrocardiogram) and CCA diameter and velocity (via Duplex ultrasound) were simultaneously recorded immediately before and during the CPT. During the CPT, while controlling end-tidal gases to baseline values, the main findings were as follows: (i) no sex differences were present in absolute or relative changes in <mml:math xmlns:mml=""http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML""> <mml:msub><mml:mover><mml:mi>V</mml:mi> <mml:mo><U+0307></mml:mo></mml:mover> <mml:mi>E</mml:mi></mml:msub> </mml:math> (P†=†0.801 and P†=†0.179, respectively); (ii) the relative MAP and CCA diameter response were reduced in females by 51 and 55%, respectively (P†=†0.008 and P†=†0.029†versus males, respectively); and (iii) the relative MAP responses was positively correlated with the dilatation of the CCA in males (r†=†0.42, P†=†0.019), in females (r†=†0.43, P†=†0.019) and in males and females combined (r†=†0.55, P†<†0.001).

26927478,A polymer dataset for accelerated property prediction and design.,"Emerging computation- and data-driven approaches are particularly useful for rationally designing materials with targeted properties. Generally, these approaches rely on identifying structure-property relationships by learning from a dataset of sufficiently large number of relevant materials. The learned information can then be used to predict the properties of materials not already in the dataset, thus accelerating the materials design. Herein, we develop a dataset of 1,073 polymers and related materials and make it available at http://khazana.uconn.edu/. This dataset is uniformly prepared using first-principles calculations with structures obtained either from other sources or by using structure search methods. Because the immediate target of this work is to assist the design of high dielectric constant polymers, it is initially designed to include the optimized structures, atomization energies, band gaps, and dielectric constants. It will be progressively expanded by accumulating new materials and including additional properties calculated for the optimized structures provided.",1,
29077896,mirTrans: a resource of transcriptional regulation on microRNAs for human cell lines.,"The cell-specific information of transcriptional regulation on microRNAs (miRNAs) is crucial to the precise understanding of gene regulations in various physiological and pathological processes existed in different tissues and cell types. The database, mirTrans, provides comprehensive information about cell-specific transcription of miRNAs including the transcriptional start sites (TSSs) of miRNAs, transcription factor (TF) to miRNA regulations and miRNA promoter sequences. mirTrans also maps the experimental H3K4me3 and DHS (DNase-I hypersensitive site) marks within miRNA promoters and expressed sequence tags (ESTs) within transcribed regions. The current version of database covers 35 259 TSSs and over 2.3 million TF-miRNA regulations for 1513 miRNAs in a total of 54 human cell lines. These cell lines span most of the biological systems, including circulatory system, digestive system and nervous system. Information for both the intragenic miRNAs and intergenic miRNAs is offered. Particularly, the quality of miRNA TSSs and TF-miRNA regulations is evaluated by literature curation. 23 447 TSS records and 2148 TF-miRNA regulations are supported by special experiments as a result of literature curation. EST coverage is also used to evaluate the accuracy of miRNA TSSs. Interface of mirTrans is friendly designed and convenient to make downloads (http://mcube.nju.edu.cn/jwang/lab/soft/mirtrans/ or http://120.27.239.192/mirtrans/).",1,
31250882,Isoform function prediction based on bi-random walks on a heterogeneous network.,"MOTIVATION:Alternative splicing contributes to the functional diversity of protein species and the proteoforms translated from alternatively spliced isoforms of a gene actually execute the biological functions. Computationally predicting the functions of genes has been studied for decades. However, how to distinguish the functional annotations of isoforms, whose annotations are essential for understanding developmental abnormalities and cancers, is rarely explored. The main bottleneck is that functional annotations of isoforms are generally unavailable and functional genomic databases universally store the functional annotations at the gene level. RESULTS:We propose IsoFun to accomplish Isoform Function prediction based on bi-random walks on a heterogeneous network. IsoFun firstly constructs an isoform functional association network based on the expression profiles of isoforms derived from multiple RNA-seq datasets. Next, IsoFun uses the available Gene Ontology annotations of genes, gene-gene interactions and the relations between genes and isoforms to construct a heterogeneous network. After this, IsoFun performs a tailored bi-random walk on the heterogeneous network to predict the association between GO terms and isoforms, thus accomplishing the prediction of GO annotations of isoforms. Experimental results show that IsoFun significantly outperforms the state-of-the-art algorithms and improves the area under the receiver-operating curve (AUROC) and the area under the precision-recall curve (AUPRC) by 17% and 44% at the gene-level, respectively. We further validated the performance of IsoFun on the genes ADAM15 and BCL2L1. IsoFun accurately differentiates the functions of respective isoforms of these two genes. AVAILABILITY AND IMPLEMENTATION:The code of IsoFun is available at http://mlda.swu.edu.cn/codes.php? name=IsoFun. SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:Supplementary data are available at Bioinformatics online.",0,
22711792,Bellerophontes: an RNA-Seq data analysis framework for chimeric transcripts discovery based on accurate fusion model.,"<h4>Motivation</h4>Next-generation sequencing technology allows the detection of genomic structural variations, novel genes and transcript isoforms from the analysis of high-throughput data. In this work, we propose a new framework for the detection of fusion transcripts through short paired-end reads which integrates splicing-driven alignment and abundance estimation analysis, producing a more accurate set of reads supporting the junction discovery and taking into account also not annotated transcripts. Bellerophontes performs a selection of putative junctions on the basis of a match to an accurate gene fusion model.<h4>Results</h4>We report the fusion genes discovered by the proposed framework on experimentally validated biological samples of chronic myelogenous leukemia (CML) and on public NCBI datasets, for which Bellerophontes is able to detect the exact junction sequence. With respect to state-of-art approaches, Bellerophontes detects the same experimentally validated fusions, however, it is more selective on the total number of detected fusions and provides a more accurate set of spanning reads supporting the junctions. We finally report the fusions involving non-annotated transcripts found in CML samples.<h4>Availability and implementation</h4>Bellerophontes JAVA/Perl/Bash software implementation is free and available at http://eda.polito.it/bellerophontes/.",0,
24058397,A consistency-based feature selection method allied with linear SVMs for HIV-1 protease cleavage site prediction.,"<h4>Background</h4>Predicting type-1 Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV-1) protease cleavage site in protein molecules and determining its specificity is an important task which has attracted considerable attention in the research community. Achievements in this area are expected to result in effective drug design (especially for HIV-1 protease inhibitors) against this life-threatening virus. However, some drawbacks (like the shortage of the available training data and the high dimensionality of the feature space) turn this task into a difficult classification problem. Thus, various machine learning techniques, and specifically several classification methods have been proposed in order to increase the accuracy of the classification model. In addition, for several classification problems, which are characterized by having few samples and many features, selecting the most relevant features is a major factor for increasing classification accuracy.<h4>Results</h4>We propose for HIV-1 data a consistency-based feature selection approach in conjunction with recursive feature elimination of support vector machines (SVMs). We used various classifiers for evaluating the results obtained from the feature selection process. We further demonstrated the effectiveness of our proposed method by comparing it with a state-of-the-art feature selection method applied on HIV-1 data, and we evaluated the reported results based on attributes which have been selected from different combinations.<h4>Conclusion</h4>Applying feature selection on training data before realizing the classification task seems to be a reasonable data-mining process when working with types of data similar to HIV-1. On HIV-1 data, some feature selection or extraction operations in conjunction with different classifiers have been tested and noteworthy outcomes have been reported. These facts motivate for the work presented in this paper.<h4>Software availability</h4>The software is available at http://ozyer.etu.edu.tr/c-fs-svm.rar.

27451428,SZDB: A Database for Schizophrenia Genetic Research.,"Schizophrenia (SZ) is a debilitating brain disorder with a complex genetic architecture. Genetic studies, especially recent genome-wide association studies (GWAS), have identified multiple variants (loci) conferring risk to SZ. However, how to efficiently extract meaningful biological information from bulk genetic findings of SZ remains a major challenge. There is a pressing need to integrate multiple layers of data from various sources, eg, genetic findings from GWAS, copy number variations (CNVs), association and linkage studies, gene expression, protein-protein interaction (PPI), co-expression, expression quantitative trait loci (eQTL), and Encyclopedia of DNA Elements (ENCODE) data, to provide a comprehensive resource to facilitate the translation of genetic findings into SZ molecular diagnosis and mechanism study. Here we developed the SZDB database (http://www.szdb.org/), a comprehensive resource for SZ research. SZ genetic data, gene expression data, network-based data, brain eQTL data, and SNP function annotation information were systematically extracted, curated and deposited in SZDB. In-depth analyses and systematic integration were performed to identify top prioritized SZ genes and enriched pathways. Multiple types of data from various layers of SZ research were systematically integrated and deposited in SZDB. In-depth data analyses and integration identified top prioritized SZ genes and enriched pathways. We further showed that genes implicated in SZ are highly co-expressed in human brain and proteins encoded by the prioritized SZ risk genes are significantly interacted. The user-friendly SZDB provides high-confidence candidate variants and genes for further functional characterization. More important, SZDB provides convenient online tools for data search and browse, data integration, and customized data analyses.",1,

31284879,ImtRDB: a database and software for mitochondrial imperfect interspersed repeats annotation.,"<h4>Background</h4>Mitochondria is a powerhouse of all eukaryotic cells that have its own circular DNA (mtDNA) encoding various RNAs and proteins. Somatic perturbations of mtDNA are accumulating with age thus it is of great importance to uncover the main sources of mtDNA instability. Recent analyses demonstrated that somatic mtDNA deletions depend on imperfect repeats of various nature between distant mtDNA segments. However, till now there are no comprehensive databases annotating all types of imperfect repeats in numerous species with sequenced complete mitochondrial genome as well as there are no algorithms capable to call all types of imperfect repeats in circular mtDNA.<h4>Results</h4>We implemented naÔve algorithm of pattern recognition by analogy to standard dot-plot construction procedures allowing us to find both perfect and imperfect repeats of four main types: direct, inverted, mirror and complementary. Our algorithm is adapted to specific characteristics of mtDNA such as circularity and an excess of short repeats - it calls imperfect repeats starting from the length of 10 b.p. We constructed interactive web available database ImtRDB depositing perfect and imperfect repeats positions in mtDNAs of more than 3500 Vertebrate species. Additional tools, such as visualization of repeats within a genome, comparison of repeat densities among different genomes and a possibility to download all results make this database useful for many biologists. Our first analyses of the database demonstrated that mtDNA imperfect repeats (i) are usually short; (ii) associated with unfolded DNA structures; (iii) four types of repeats positively correlate with each other forming two equivalent pairs: direct and mirror versus inverted and complementary, with identical nucleotide content and similar distribution between species; (iv) abundance of repeats is negatively associated with GC content; (v) dinucleotides GC versus CG are overrepresented on light chain of mtDNA covered by repeats.<h4>Conclusions</h4>ImtRDB is available at http://bioinfodbs.kantiana.ru/ImtRDB/ . It is accompanied by the software calling all types of interspersed repeats with different level of degeneracy in circular DNA. This database and software can become a very useful tool in various areas of mitochondrial and chloroplast DNA research.",1,
26432833,iPPI-DB: an online database of modulators of protein-protein interactions.,"In order to boost the identification of low-molecular-weight drugs on protein-protein interactions (PPI), it is essential to properly collect and annotate experimental data about successful examples. This provides the scientific community with the necessary information to derive trends about privileged physicochemical properties and chemotypes that maximize the likelihood of promoting a given chemical probe to the most advanced stages of development. To this end we have developed iPPI-DB (freely accessible at http://www.ippidb.cdithem.fr), a database that contains the structure, some physicochemical characteristics, the pharmacological data and the profile of the PPI targets of several hundreds modulators of protein-protein interactions. iPPI-DB is accessible through a web application and can be queried according to two general approaches: using physicochemical/pharmacological criteria; or by chemical similarity to a user-defined structure input. In both cases the results are displayed as a sortable and exportable datasheet with links to external databases such as Uniprot, PubMed. Furthermore each compound in the table has a link to an individual ID card that contains its physicochemical and pharmacological profile derived from iPPI-DB data. This includes information about its binding data, ligand and lipophilic efficiencies, location in the PPI chemical space, and importantly similarity with known drugs, and links to external databases like PubChem, and ChEMBL.",1,

Based on a contemporary printed corpus of over 227 million words, P-PAL provides a broad range of word attributes and statistics, including several measures of word frequency (e.g., raw counts, per-million word frequency, logarithmic Zipf scale), morpho-syntactic information (e.g., parts of speech [PoSs], grammatical gender and number, dominant PoS, and frequency and relative frequency of the dominant PoS), as well as several lexical and sublexical orthographic (e.g., number of letters; consonant-vowel orthographic structure; density and frequency of orthographic neighbors; orthographic Levenshtein distance; orthographic uniqueness point; orthographic syllabification; and trigram, bigram, and letter type and token frequencies), and phonological measures (e.g., pronunciation, number of phonemes, stress, density and frequency of phonological neighbors, transposed and phonographic neighbors, syllabification, and biphone and phone type and token frequencies) for ~53,000 lemmatized and ~208,000 nonlemmatized EP word forms. To obtain these metrics, researchers can choose between two word queries in the application: (i) analyze words previously selected for specific attributes and/or lexical and sublexical characteristics, or (ii) generate word lists that meet word requirements defined by the user in the menu of analyses.

26672762,CyREST: Turbocharging Cytoscape Access for External Tools via a RESTful API.,"As bioinformatic workflows become increasingly complex and involve multiple specialized tools, so does the difficulty of reliably reproducing those workflows. Cytoscape is a critical workflow component for executing network visualization, analysis, and publishing tasks, but it can be operated only manually via a point-and-click user interface. Consequently, Cytoscape-oriented tasks are laborious and often error prone, especially with multistep protocols involving many networks. In this paper, we present the new cyREST Cytoscape app and accompanying harmonization libraries. Together, they improve workflow reproducibility and researcher productivity by enabling popular languages (e.g., Python and R, JavaScript, and C#) and tools (e.g., IPython/Jupyter Notebook and RStudio) to directly define and query networks, and perform network analysis, layouts and renderings. We describe cyREST's API and overall construction, and present Python- and R-based examples that illustrate how Cytoscape can be integrated into large scale data analysis pipelines. cyREST is available in the Cytoscape app store (http://apps.cytoscape.org) where it has been downloaded over 1900 times since its release in late 2014.",0,
33457124,GAPDH and PUM1: Optimal Housekeeping Genes for Quantitative Polymerase Chain Reaction-Based Analysis of Cancer Stem Cells and Epithelial-Mesenchymal Transition Gene Expression in Rectal Tumors.,"Background The overwhelming majority of published articles have taken colon and rectal cancer as a single group, i.e., colorectal cancer, when normalizing gene expression data with housekeeping genes (HKG) in quantitative polymerase chain reaction (qPCR) experiments though there are published reports that suggest the differential expression pattern of genes between the colon and rectal cancer groups and hence the current experiment was†attempted to find out the optimal set of†housekeeping genes from the list of common HKG for rectal tumor gene expression analysis. Methods The expression of five†potential housekeeping genes GAPDH, RPNI, PUM1, B2M, and PMM1†was analyzed through qPCR and Bestkeeper software (http://www.wzw.tum.de/gene-quantification/bestkeeper.html) in 20 stage II-IV rectal cancer samples†to check for uniformity in their expression pattern. Cancer stem cell (CSC) marker ALDH1 and epithelial-mesenchymal transition marker (EMT) markers E cadherin, vimentin, Twist,†and SNAI2 expression were evaluated in conjunction with the two optimal reference genes in†10 rectal cancers as part of validation. Results The standard deviation of the cycle threshold value of GAPDH was found the lowest at 0.65 followed by RPN1 at 0.88, PUM1 at 0.94, PMM1 at 0.94, and B2M at 1.21 when analyzed with BestKeeper software. Using GAPDH and PUM1 as the reference gene for the validation phase, rectal cancer patients with stage†III/IV showed a 4.79-fold change (P=0.006) in ALDH1 expression, and an 11.76-fold change in Twist expression (P=0.003) with respect to stage II rectal tumor when normalized with GAPDH and PUM1. Conclusion GAPDH and PUM1 can be used as an optimal set of housekeeping genes for gene expression-related experiments in rectal tumors. ALDH1 and Twist were found significantly overexpressed in stage III/IV rectal tumors in comparison to stage II rectal cancer. Genes associated with†cancer stem cells and EMT markers could be optimally analyzed by normalizing them with GAPDH and PUM1 as housekeeping genes.",0,
31028388,SEanalysis: a web tool for super-enhancer associated regulatory analysis.,"Super-enhancers (SEs) have prominent roles in biological and pathological processes through their unique transcriptional regulatory capability. To date, several SE databases have been developed by us and others. However, these existing databases do not provide downstream or upstream regulatory analyses of SEs. Pathways, transcription factors (TFs), SEs, and SE-associated genes form complex regulatory networks. Therefore, we designed a novel web server, SEanalysis, which provides comprehensive SE-associated regulatory network analyses. SEanalysis characterizes SE-associated genes, TFs binding to target SEs, and their upstream pathways. The current version of SEanalysis contains more than 330 000 SEs from more than 540 types of cells/tissues, 5042 TF ChIP-seq data generated from these cells/tissues, DNA-binding sequence motifs for ~700 human TFs and 2880 pathways from 10 databases. SEanalysis supports searching by either SEs, samples, TFs, pathways or genes. The complex regulatory networks formed by these factors can be interactively visualized. In addition, we developed a customizable genome browser containing >6000 customizable tracks for visualization. The server is freely available at http://licpathway.net/SEanalysis.",0,
32422927,HDVdb: A Comprehensive Hepatitis D Virus Database.,"Hepatitis D virus (HDV) causes the most severe form of viral hepatitis, which may rapidly progress to liver cirrhosis and hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). It has been estimated that 15-20 million people worldwide are suffering from the chronic HDV infection. Currently, no effective therapies are available to treat acute or chronic HDV infection. The remarkable sequence variability of the HDV genome, particularly within the hypervariable region has resulted in the provisional classification of eight major genotypes and various subtypes. We have developed a specialized database, HDVdb (http://hdvdb.bio.wzw.tum.de/), which contains a collection of partial and complete HDV genomic sequences obtained from the GenBank and from our own patient cohort. HDVdb enables the researchers to investigate the genetic variability of all available HDV sequences, correlation of genotypes to epidemiology and pathogenesis.

29990104,A Robust 3D-2D Interactive Tool for Scene Segmentation and Annotation.,"Recent advances of 3D acquisition devices have enabled large-scale acquisition of 3D scene data. Such data, if completely and well annotated, can serve as useful ingredients for a wide spectrum of computer vision and graphics works such as data-driven modeling and scene understanding, object detection and recognition. However, annotating a vast amount of 3D scene data remains challenging due to the lack of an effective tool and/or the complexity of 3D scenes (e.g. clutter, varying illumination conditions). This paper aims to build a robust annotation tool that effectively and conveniently enables the segmentation and annotation of massive 3D data. Our tool works by coupling 2D and 3D information via an interactive framework, through which users can provide high-level semantic annotation for objects. We have experimented our tool and found that a typical indoor scene could be well segmented and annotated in less than 30 minutes by using the tool, as opposed to a few hours if done manually. Along with the tool, we created a dataset of over a hundred 3D scenes associated with complete annotations using our tool. Both the tool and dataset will be available at http://scenenn.net.",1,

26581084,Transcriptator: An Automated Computational Pipeline to Annotate Assembled Reads and Identify Non Coding RNA.,"RNA-seq is a new tool to measure RNA transcript counts, using high-throughput sequencing at an extraordinary accuracy. It provides quantitative means to explore the transcriptome of an organism of interest. However, interpreting this extremely large data into biological knowledge is a problem, and biologist-friendly tools are lacking. In our lab, we developed Transcriptator, a web application based on a computational Python pipeline with a user-friendly Java interface. This pipeline uses the web services available for BLAST (Basis Local Search Alignment Tool), QuickGO and DAVID (Database for Annotation, Visualization and Integrated Discovery) tools. It offers a report on statistical analysis of functional and Gene Ontology (GO) annotation's enrichment. It helps users to identify enriched biological themes, particularly GO terms, pathways, domains, gene/proteins features and protein-protein interactions related informations. It clusters the transcripts based on functional annotations and generates a tabular report for functional and gene ontology annotations for each submitted transcript to the web server. The implementation of QuickGo web-services in our pipeline enable the users to carry out GO-Slim analysis, whereas the integration of PORTRAIT (Prediction of transcriptomic non coding RNA (ncRNA) by ab initio methods) helps to identify the non coding RNAs and their regulatory role in transcriptome. In summary, Transcriptator is a useful software for both NGS and array data. It helps the users to characterize the de-novo assembled reads, obtained from NGS experiments for non-referenced organisms, while it also performs the functional enrichment analysis of differentially expressed transcripts/genes for both RNA-seq and micro-array experiments. It generates easy to read tables and interactive charts for better understanding of the data. The pipeline is modular in nature, and provides an opportunity to add new plugins in the future.

27596593,Order restricted inference for oscillatory systems for detecting rhythmic signals.,"<h4>Motivation</h4>Many biological processes, such as cell cycle, circadian clock, menstrual cycles, are governed by oscillatory systems consisting of numerous components that exhibit rhythmic patterns over time. It is not always easy to identify such rhythmic components. For example, it is a challenging problem to identify circadian genes in a given tissue using time-course gene expression data. There is a great potential for misclassifying non-rhythmic as rhythmic genes and vice versa. This has been a problem of considerable interest in recent years. In this article we develop a constrained inference based methodology called Order Restricted Inference for Oscillatory Systems (ORIOS) to detect rhythmic signals. Instead of using mathematical functions (e.g. sinusoidal) to describe shape of rhythmic signals, ORIOS uses mathematical inequalities. Consequently, it is robust and not limited by the biologist's choice of the mathematical model. We studied the performance of ORIOS using simulated as well as real data obtained from mouse liver, pituitary gland and data from NIH3T3, U2OS cell lines. Our results suggest that, for a broad collection of patterns of gene expression, ORIOS has substantially higher power to detect true rhythmic genes in comparison to some popular methods, while also declaring substantially fewer non-rhythmic genes as rhythmic.<h4>Availability and implementation</h4>A user friendly code implemented in R language can be downloaded from http://www.niehs.nih.gov/research/atniehs/labs/bb/staff/peddada/index.cfm CONTACT: peddada@niehs.nih.gov.",0,

22784567,SigCS base: an integrated genetic information resource for human cerebral stroke.,"<h4>Background</h4>To understand how stroke risk factors mechanistically contribute to stroke, the genetic components regulating each risk factor need to be integrated and evaluated with respect to biological function and through pathway-based algorithms. This resource will provide information to researchers studying the molecular and genetic causes of stroke in terms of genomic variants, genes, and pathways.<h4>Methods</h4>Reported genetic variants, gene structure, phenotypes, and literature information regarding stroke were collected and extracted from publicly available databases describing variants, genome, proteome, functional annotation, and disease subtypes. Stroke related candidate pathways and etiologic genes that participate significantly in risk were analyzed in terms of canonical pathways in public biological pathway databases. These efforts resulted in a relational database of genetic signals of cerebral stroke, SigCS base, which implements an effective web retrieval system.<h4>Results</h4>The current version of SigCS base documents 1943 non-redundant genes with 11472 genetic variants and 165 non-redundant pathways. The web retrieval system of SigCS base consists of two principal search flows, including: 1) a gene-based variant search using gene table browsing or a keyword search, and, 2) a pathway-based variant search using pathway table browsing. SigCS base is freely accessible at http://sysbio.kribb.re.kr/sigcs.<h4>Conclusions</h4>SigCS base is an effective tool that can assist researchers in the identification of the genetic factors associated with stroke by utilizing existing literature information, selecting candidate genes and variants for experimental studies, and examining the pathways that contribute to the pathophysiological mechanisms of stroke.",1,
26537179,BRANE Cut: biologically-related a priori network enhancement with graph cuts for gene regulatory network inference.,"<h4>Background</h4>Inferring gene networks from high-throughput data constitutes an important step in the discovery of relevant regulatory relationships in organism cells. Despite the large number of available Gene Regulatory Network inference methods, the problem remains challenging: the underdetermination in the space of possible solutions requires additional constraints that incorporate a priori information on gene interactions.<h4>Methods</h4>Weighting all possible pairwise gene relationships by a probability of edge presence, we formulate the regulatory network inference as a discrete variational problem on graphs. We enforce biologically plausible coupling between groups and types of genes by minimizing an edge labeling functional coding for a priori structures. The optimization is carried out with Graph cuts, an approach popular in image processing and computer vision. We compare the inferred regulatory networks to results achieved by the mutual-information-based Context Likelihood of Relatedness (CLR) method and by the state-of-the-art GENIE3, winner of the DREAM4 multifactorial challenge.<h4>Results</h4>Our BRANE Cut approach infers more accurately the five DREAM4 in silico networks (with improvements from 6% to 11%). On a real Escherichia coli compendium, an improvement of 11.8% compared to CLR and 3% compared to GENIE3 is obtained in terms of Area Under Precision-Recall curve. Up to 48 additional verified interactions are obtained over GENIE3 for a given precision. On this dataset involving 4345 genes, our method achieves a performance similar to that of GENIE3, while being more than seven times faster. The BRANE Cut code is available at: http://www-syscom.univ-mlv.fr/~pirayre/Codes-GRN-BRANE-cut.html.<h4>Conclusions</h4>BRANE Cut is a weighted graph thresholding method. Using biologically sound penalties and data-driven parameters, it improves three state-of-the art GRN inference methods. It is applicable as a generic network inference post-processing, due to its computational efficiency.",0,
26756459,Intranasal or transdermal nicotine for the treatment of postoperative pain.,"<h4>Background</h4>Acute pain frequently occurs after surgical procedures. Nicotine has been explored as an adjunctive medication for management of postoperative pain.††<h4>Objectives</h4>To assess the effect of transdermal or intranasal nicotine administration on postoperative pain, opioid analgesic use, and opioid-related adverse events.††<h4>Search methods</h4>We searched MEDLINE (1966 to 20 March 2014), the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL; 2014, Issue 3), EMBASE (1980 to 20 March 2014), and also databases of ongoing trials (www.controlled-trials.com/†and†http://clinicaltrials.gov/). We re-ran the search on 28 April 2015. We will assess the one study of interest when we update the review.<h4>Selection criteria</h4>We included randomized, placebo-controlled clinical trials that evaluated the effects of perioperative (pre-, intra-, or postoperative) administration of nicotine on postoperative pain, opioid use, and opioid-related adverse events.†We excluded all other studies.<h4>Data collection and analysis</h4>Two authors independently screened all titles and abstracts for eligibility and documented reasons for exclusion. In case of disagreement, a third author decided on the inclusion or exclusion of a trial report. When additional information was needed in order to decide if a trial should be included, one of the authors contacted the corresponding author of the trial in question.<h4>Main results</h4>Nine trials (666 participants) evaluated nicotine for postoperative pain. Nicotine may reduce postoperative pain scores at 24 hours by a small amount compared with placebo (eight trials, mean difference -0.88 on a 0 to 10 scale, 95% confidence interval (CI) -1.58 to -0.18; low quality evidence). The effect on pain at one hour and 12 hours postoperatively was less certain (very low quality evidence). Statistical heterogeneity was substantial and not adequately explained by stratification of trials according to type of surgical procedure, smoking status, mode of nicotine administration, timing of administration, or assessed risk of bias. Excluding one trial at high risk of bias resulted in similar findings. The effect of nicotine on postoperative opioid use was uncertain due to small number of participants in the studies. Nicotine probably increases the risk of postoperative nausea (seven trials, RR 1.24, 95% CI 1.03 to 1.50; moderate quality evidence). Three trials assessed sedation but the effect is very uncertain due to the very low quality of evidence. We found no evidence that nicotine increased the risk of vomiting (seven studies, risk difference (RD) 0.03, 95% CI -0.04 to 0.09; low quality evidence). The results from one single small trial were insufficient to establish whether nicotine led to an earlier hospital discharge (very low quality evidence).<h4>Authors' conclusions</h4>Based on evidence of generally low quality, nicotine may reduce postoperative pain at 24 hours compared with placebo, but the effects were relatively small (less than 1 point on a 10 point pain scale) and there was substantial heterogeneity in the results of our analyses. Nicotine does not appear to reduce postoperative use of opioids or opioid-related adverse events but probably increases the risk of nausea. More research is needed to determine the effectiveness of nicotine for postoperative pain and to understand the optimal timing, dose, and method of delivery of nicotine.",0,
26590405,TSGene 2.0: an updated literature-based knowledgebase for tumor suppressor genes.,"Tumor suppressor genes (TSGs) are a major type of gatekeeper genes in the cell growth. A knowledgebase with the systematic collection and curation of TSGs in multiple cancer types is critically important for further studying their biological functions as well as for developing therapeutic strategies. Since its development in 2012, the Tumor Suppressor Gene database (TSGene), has become a popular resource in the cancer research community. Here, we reported the TSGene version 2.0, which has substantial updates of contents (e.g. up-to-date literature and pan-cancer genomic data collection and curation), data types (noncoding RNAs and protein-coding genes) and content accessibility. Specifically, the current TSGene 2.0 contains 1217 human TSGs (1018 protein-coding and 199 non-coding genes) curated from over 9000 articles. Additionally, TSGene 2.0 provides thousands of expression and mutation patterns derived from pan-cancer data of The Cancer Genome Atlas. A new web interface is available at http://bioinfo.mc.vanderbilt.edu/TSGene/. Systematic analyses of 199 non-coding TSGs provide numerous cancer-specific non-coding mutational events for further screening and clinical use. Intriguingly, we identified 49 protein-coding TSGs that were consistently down-regulated in 11 cancer types. In summary, TSGene 2.0, which is the only available database for TSGs, provides the most updated TSGs and their features in pan-cancer.",1,
24907201,SeaBase: a multispecies transcriptomic resource and platform for gene network inference.,"Marine and aquatic animals are extraordinarily useful as models for identifying mechanisms of development and evolution, regeneration, resistance to cancer, longevity and symbiosis, among many other areas of research. This is due to the great diversity of these organisms and their wide-ranging capabilities. Genomics tools are essential for taking advantage of these ""free lessons"" of nature. However, genomics and transcriptomics are challenging in emerging model systems. Here, we present SeaBase, a tool for helping to meet these needs. Specifically, SeaBase provides a platform for sharing and searching transcriptome data. More importantly, SeaBase will support a growing number of tools for inferring gene network mechanisms. The first dataset available on SeaBase is a developmental transcriptomic profile of the sea anemone Nematostella vectensis (Anthozoa, Cnidaria). Additional datasets are currently being prepared and we are aiming to expand SeaBase to include user-supplied data for any number of marine and aquatic organisms, thereby supporting many potentially new models for gene network studies.

27113639,Vapocoolants (cold spray) for pain treatment during intravenous cannulation.,"<h4>Background</h4>Intravenous cannulation is a painful procedure that can provoke anxiety and stress. Injecting local anaesthetic can provide analgesia at the time of cannulation, but it is a painful procedure. Topical anaesthetic creams take between 30 and 90 minutes to produce an effect. A quicker acting analgesic allows more timely investigation and treatment. Vapocoolants have been used in this setting, but studies have reported mixed results.<h4>Objectives</h4>To determine effects of vapocoolants on pain associated with intravenous cannulation in adults and children. To explore variables that might affect the performance of vapocoolants, including time required for application, distance from the skin when applied and time to cannulation. To look at adverse effects associated with the use of vapocoolants.<h4>Search methods</h4>We searched the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), MEDLINE, EMBASE, Latin American Caribbean Health Sciences Literature (LILACS), the Cumulative Index to Nursing and Allied Health Literature (CINAHL), the Institute for Scientific Information (ISI) Web of Science and the http://clinicaltrials.gov/, http://www.controlled-trials.com/ and http://www.trialscentral.org/ databases to 1 May 2015. We applied no language restrictions. We also scanned the reference lists of included papers.<h4>Selection criteria</h4>We included all blinded and unblinded randomized controlled trials (RTCs) comparing any vapocoolant with placebo or control to reduce pain during intravenous cannulation in adults and children.<h4>Data collection and analysis</h4>Three review authors independently assessed trial quality and extracted data, contacted study authors for additional information and assessed included studies for risk of bias. We collected and analysed data for the primary outcome of pain during cannulation, and for the secondary outcomes of pain associated with application of the vapocoolant, first attempt success rate of intravenous cannulation, adverse events and participant satisfaction. We performed subgroup analyses for the primary outcome to examine differences based on age of participant, type of vapocoolant used, application time of vapocoolant and clinical situation (emergency vs elective). We used random-effects model meta-analysis in RevMan 5.3 and assessed heterogeneity between trial results by examining forest plots and calculating the I(2) statistic.<h4>Main results</h4>We found nine suitable studies of 1070 participants and included them in the qualitative analyses. We included eight studies of 848 participants in the meta-analysis for the primary outcome (pain during intravenous cannulation). Use of vapocoolants resulted in a reduction in pain scores as measured by a linear 100 mm visual analogue scale (VAS 100) compared with controls (difference between means -12.5 mm, 95% confidence interval (CI) -18.7 to -6.4 mm; moderate-quality evidence). We could not include in the meta-analysis one study, which showed no effects of the intervention.Use of vapocoolants resulted in increased pain scores at the time of application as measured by a VAS 100 compared with controls (difference between means 6.3 mm, 95% CI 2.2 to 10.3 mm; four studies, 461 participants; high-quality evidence) and led to no difference in first attempt success compared with controls (risk ratio (RR) 1.00, 95% CI 0.94 to 1.06; six studies, 812 participants; moderate-quality evidence). We documented eight minor adverse events reported in 279 vapocoolant participants (risk difference (RD) 0.03, 95% CI 0 to 0.05; five studies, 551 participants; low quality-evidence).The overall risk of bias of individual studies ranged from low to high, with high risk of bias for performance and detection bias in four studies. Sensitivity analysis showed that exclusion of studies at high or unclear risk of bias did not materially alter the results of this review.<h4>Authors' conclusions</h4>Moderate-quality evidence indicates that use of a vapocoolant immediately before intravenous cannulation reduces pain during the procedure. Use of vapocoolant does not increase the difficulty of cannulation nor cause serious adverse effects but is associated with mild discomfort during application.",0,
21846404,Prediction of conformational B-cell epitopes from 3D structures by random forests with a distance-based feature.,"<h4>Background</h4>Antigen-antibody interactions are key events in immune system, which provide important clues to the immune processes and responses. In Antigen-antibody interactions, the specific sites on the antigens that are directly bound by the B-cell produced antibodies are well known as B-cell epitopes. The identification of epitopes is a hot topic in bioinformatics because of their potential use in the epitope-based drug design. Although most B-cell epitopes are discontinuous (or conformational), insufficient effort has been put into the conformational epitope prediction, and the performance of existing methods is far from satisfaction.<h4>Results</h4>In order to develop the high-accuracy model, we focus on some possible aspects concerning the prediction performance, including the impact of interior residues, different contributions of adjacent residues, and the imbalanced data which contain much more non-epitope residues than epitope residues. In order to address above issues, we take following strategies. Firstly, a concept of 'thick surface patch' instead of 'surface patch' is introduced to describe the local spatial context of each surface residue, which considers the impact of interior residue. The comparison between the thick surface patch and the surface patch shows that interior residues contribute to the recognition of epitopes. Secondly, statistical significance of the distance distribution difference between non-epitope patches and epitope patches is observed, thus an adjacent residue distance feature is presented, which reflects the unequal contributions of adjacent residues to the location of binding sites. Thirdly, a bootstrapping and voting procedure is adopted to deal with the imbalanced dataset. Based on the above ideas, we propose a new method to identify the B-cell conformational epitopes from 3D structures by combining conventional features and the proposed feature, and the random forest (RF) algorithm is used as the classification engine. The experiments show that our method can predict conformational B-cell epitopes with high accuracy. Evaluated by leave-one-out cross validation (LOOCV), our method achieves the mean AUC value of 0.633 for the benchmark bound dataset, and the mean AUC value of 0.654 for the benchmark unbound dataset. When compared with the state-of-the-art prediction models in the independent test, our method demonstrates comparable or better performance.<h4>Conclusions</h4>Our method is demonstrated to be effective for the prediction of conformational epitopes. Based on the study, we develop a tool to predict the conformational epitopes from 3D structures, available at http://code.google.com/p/my-project-bpredictor/downloads/list.",0,
PMC7775396,Creation of an Online Platform for Identification of Microorganisms: Peak Picking or Full-Spectrum Analysis,"Identification of microorganisms by MALDI-TOF mass spectrometry is a very efficient method with high throughput, speed, and accuracy. However, it is significantly limited by the absence of a universal database of reference mass spectra. This problem can be solved by creating an Internet platform for open databases of protein spectra of microorganisms. Choosing the optimal mathematical apparatus is the pivotal issue for this task. In our previous study we proposed the geometric approach for processing mass spectrometry data, which represented a mass spectrum as a vector in a multidimensional Euclidean space. This algorithm was implemented in a Jacob4 stand-alone package. We demonstrated its efficiency in delimiting two closely related species of the Bacillus pumilus group. In this study, the geometric approach was realized as R scripts which allowed us to design a Web-based application. We also studied the possibility of using full spectra analysis (FSA) without calculating mass peaks (PPA), which is the logical development of the method. We used 74 microbial strains from the collections of ICiG SB RAS, UNIQEM, IEGM, KMM, and VGM as the models. We demonstrated that the algorithms based on peak-picking and analysis of complete data have accuracy no less than that of Biotyper 3.1 software. We proposed a method for calculating cut-off thresholds based on averaged intraspecific distances. The resulting database, raw data, and the set of R scripts are available online at https://icg-test.mydisk.nsc.ru/s/qj6cfZg57g6qwzN.",1,

In this article, we present a new version of the ProBiS web server that is 10 times faster than earlier versions, due to the efficient parallelization of the ProBiS algorithm, which now allows significantly faster comparison of a protein query against the PDB and reduces the calculation time for scanning the entire PDB from hours to minutes. It also features new web services, and an improved user interface. In addition, the new web server is united with the ProBiS-Database and thus provides instant access to pre-calculated protein similarity profiles for over 29 000 non-redundant protein structures.

23981350,Inferring nucleosome positions with their histone mark annotation from ChIP data.,"<h4>Motivation</h4>The nucleosome is the basic repeating unit of chromatin. It contains two copies each of the four core histones H2A, H2B, H3 and H4 and about 147 bp of DNA. The residues of the histone proteins are subject to numerous post-translational modifications, such as methylation or acetylation. Chromatin immunoprecipitiation followed by sequencing (ChIP-seq) is a technique that provides genome-wide occupancy data of these modified histone proteins, and it requires appropriate computational methods.<h4>Results</h4>We present NucHunter, an algorithm that uses the data from ChIP-seq experiments directed against many histone modifications to infer positioned nucleosomes. NucHunter annotates each of these nucleosomes with the intensities of the histone modifications. We demonstrate that these annotations can be used to infer nucleosomal states with distinct correlations to underlying genomic features and chromatin-related processes, such as transcriptional start sites, enhancers, elongation by RNA polymerase II and chromatin-mediated repression. Thus, NucHunter is a versatile tool that can be used to predict positioned nucleosomes from a panel of histone modification ChIP-seq experiments and infer distinct histone modification patterns associated to different chromatin states.<h4>Availability</h4>The software is available at http://epigen.molgen.mpg.de/nuchunter/.",0,
23812995,Compressive genomics for protein databases.,"<h4>Motivation</h4>The exponential growth of protein sequence databases has increasingly made the fundamental question of searching for homologs a computational bottleneck. The amount of unique data, however, is not growing nearly as fast; we can exploit this fact to greatly accelerate homology search. Acceleration of programs in the popular PSI/DELTA-BLAST family of tools will not only speed-up homology search directly but also the huge collection of other current programs that primarily interact with large protein databases via precisely these tools.<h4>Results</h4>We introduce a suite of homology search tools, powered by compressively accelerated protein BLAST (CaBLASTP), which are significantly faster than and comparably accurate with all known state-of-the-art tools, including HHblits, DELTA-BLAST and PSI-BLAST. Further, our tools are implemented in a manner that allows direct substitution into existing analysis pipelines. The key idea is that we introduce a local similarity-based compression scheme that allows us to operate directly on the compressed data. Importantly, CaBLASTP's runtime scales almost linearly in the amount of unique data, as opposed to current BLASTP variants, which scale linearly in the size of the full protein database being searched. Our compressive algorithms will speed-up many tasks, such as protein structure prediction and orthology mapping, which rely heavily on homology search.<h4>Availability</h4>CaBLASTP is available under the GNU Public License at http://cablastp.csail.mit.edu/<h4>Contact</h4>bab@mit.edu.",0,
31034103,Functional analysis tools for post-translational modification: a post-translational modification database for analysis of proteins and metabolic pathways.,"Post-translational modifications (PTMs) are critical regulators of protein function, and nearly 200 different types of PTM have been identified. Advances in high-resolution mass spectrometry have led to the identification of an unprecedented number of PTM sites in numerous organisms, potentially facilitating a more complete understanding of how PTMs regulate cellular behavior. While databases have been created to house the resulting data, most of these resources focus on individual types of PTM, do not consider quantitative PTM analyses or do not provide tools for the visualization and analysis of PTM data. Here, we describe the Functional Analysis Tools for Post-Translational Modifications (FAT-PTM) database (https://bioinformatics.cse.unr.edu/fat-ptm/), which currently supports eight different types of PTM and over 49†000 PTM sites identified in large-scale proteomic surveys of the model organism Arabidopsis thaliana. The FAT-PTM database currently supports tools to visualize protein-centric PTM networks, quantitative phosphorylation site data from over 10 different quantitative phosphoproteomic studies, PTM information displayed in protein-centric metabolic pathways and groups of proteins that are co-modified by multiple PTMs. Overall, the FAT-PTM database provides users with a robust platform to share and visualize experimentally supported PTM data, develop hypotheses related to target proteins or identify emergent patterns in PTM data for signaling and metabolic pathways.",1,
25765651,Analysis of strand-specific RNA-seq data using machine learning reveals the structures of transcription units in Clostridium thermocellum.,"Identification of transcription units (TUs) encoded in a bacterial genome is essential to elucidation of transcriptional regulation of the organism. To gain a detailed understanding of the dynamically composed TU structures, we have used four strand-specific RNA-seq (ssRNA-seq) datasets collected under two experimental conditions to derive the genomic TU organization of Clostridium thermocellum using a machine-learning approach. Our method accurately predicted the genomic boundaries of individual TUs based on two sets of parameters measuring the RNA-seq expression patterns across the genome: expression-level continuity and variance. A total of 2590 distinct TUs are predicted based on the four RNA-seq datasets. Among the predicted TUs, 44% have multiple genes. We assessed our prediction method on an independent set of RNA-seq data with longer reads. The evaluation confirmed the high quality of the predicted TUs. Functional enrichment analyses on a selected subset of the predicted TUs revealed interesting biology. To demonstrate the generality of the prediction method, we have also applied the method to RNA-seq data collected on Escherichia coli and achieved high prediction accuracies. The TU prediction program named SeqTU is publicly available at https://code.google.com/p/seqtu/. We expect that the predicted TUs can serve as the baseline information for studying transcriptional and post-transcriptional regulation in C. thermocellum and other bacteria.",0,

The DO's continual integration of human disease knowledge, evidenced by the more than 200 SVN/GitHub releases/revisions, since previously reported in our DO 2015 NAR paper, includes the addition of 2650 new disease terms, a 30% increase of textual definitions, and an expanding suite of disease classification hierarchies constructed through defined logical axioms.",1,
27188311,A comprehensive database of high-throughput sequencing-based RNA secondary structure probing data (Structure Surfer).,"<h4>Background</h4>RNA molecules fold into complex three-dimensional shapes, guided by the pattern of hydrogen bonding between nucleotides. This pattern of base pairing, known as RNA secondary structure, is critical to their cellular function. Recently several diverse methods have been developed to assay RNA secondary structure on a transcriptome-wide scale using high-throughput sequencing. Each approach has its own strengths and caveats, however there is no widely available tool for visualizing and comparing the results from these varied methods.<h4>Methods</h4>To address this, we have developed Structure Surfer, a database and visualization tool for inspecting RNA secondary structure in six transcriptome-wide data sets from human and mouse ( http://tesla.pcbi.upenn.edu/strucuturesurfer/ ). The data sets were generated using four different high-throughput sequencing based methods. Each one was analyzed with a scoring pipeline specific to its experimental design. Users of Structure Surfer have the ability to query individual loci as well as detect trends across multiple sites.<h4>Results</h4>Here, we describe the included data sets and their differences. We illustrate the database's function by examining known structural elements and we explore example use cases in which combined data is used to detect structural trends.<h4>Conclusions</h4>In total, Structure Surfer provides an easy-to-use database and visualization interface for allowing users to interrogate the currently available transcriptome-wide RNA secondary structure information for mammals.",1,
30367593,On the impact of uncertain gene tree rooting on duplication-transfer-loss reconciliation.,"<h4>Background</h4>Duplication-Transfer-Loss (DTL) reconciliation is a powerful and increasingly popular technique for studying the evolution of microbial gene families. DTL reconciliation requires the use of rooted gene trees to perform the reconciliation with the species tree, and the standard technique for rooting gene trees is to assign a root that results in the minimum reconciliation cost across all rootings of that gene tree. However, even though it is well understood that many gene trees have multiple optimal roots, only a single optimal root is randomly chosen to create the rooted gene tree and perform the reconciliation. This remains an important overlooked and unaddressed problem in DTL reconciliation, leading to incorrect evolutionary inferences. In this work, we perform an in-depth analysis of the impact of uncertain gene tree rooting on the computed DTL reconciliation and provide the first computational tools to quantify and negate the impact of gene tree rooting uncertainty on DTL reconciliation.<h4>Results</h4>Our analysis of a large data set of over 4500 gene families from 100 species shows that a large fraction of gene trees have multiple optimal rootings, that these multiple roots often, but not always, appear closely clustered together in the same region of the gene tree, that many aspects of the reconciliation remain conserved across the multiple rootings, that gene tree error has a profound impact on the prevalence and structure of multiple optimal rootings, and that there are specific interesting patterns in the reconciliation of those gene trees that have multiple optimal roots.<h4>Conclusions</h4>Our results show that unrooted gene trees can be meaningfully reconciled and high-quality evolutionary information can be obtained from them even after accounting for multiple optimal rootings. In addition, the techniques and tools introduced in this paper make it possible to systematically avoid incorrect evolutionary inferences caused by incorrect or uncertain gene tree rooting. These tools have been implemented in the phylogenetic reconciliation software package RANGER-DTL 2.0, freely available from http://compbio.engr.uconn.edu/software/RANGER-DTL/ .",0,
28918286,Identifying combinatorial biomarkers by association rule mining in the CAMD Alzheimer's database.,"The concept of combinatorial biomarkers was conceived when it was noticed that simple biomarkers are often inadequate for recognizing and characterizing complex diseases. Here we present an algorithmic search method for complex biomarkers which may predict or indicate Alzheimer's disease (AD) and other kinds of dementia. We show that our method is universal since it can describe any Boolean function for biomarker discovery. We applied data mining techniques that are capable to uncover implication-like logical schemes with detailed quality scoring. The new SCARF program was applied for the Tucson, Arizona based Critical Path Institute's CAMD database, containing laboratory and cognitive test data for 5821 patients from the placebo arm of clinical trials of large pharmaceutical companies, and consequently, the data is much more reliable than numerous other databases for dementia. The results of our study on this larger than 5800-patient cohort suggest beneficial effects of high B12 vitamin level, negative effects of high sodium levels or high AST (aspartate aminotransferase) liver enzyme levels to cognition. As an example for a more complex and quite surprising rule: Low or normal blood glucose level with either low cholesterol or high serum sodium would also increase the probability of bad cognition with a 3.7 multiplier.

26078289,"Breast Cancer and Occupation: The Need for Action: APHA Policy Statement Number 20146, Issued November 18, 2014.","Breast cancer is the most prevalent cancer among women in the United States and other countries, making it a major public health concern. Despite significant scientific evidence about its known or suspected causes, research and prevention measures to identify and eliminate occupational and other environmental hazards and risk factors for breast cancer remain largely overlooked. As a result, hazards continue unabated for women generally, especially those who work outside the home. The science linking breast cancer and occupation in particular is growing. Researchers have identified commonly used chemicals that induce breast tumors in test animals. Animal studies link chemicals that mimic reproductive hormones to elevated breast cancer rates. Other animal and human studies link chemical exposures to increased breast cancer rates, including two recent investigations focused on occupational hazards. But the latter are the exception. Studies that attempt to identify and characterize workplace agents linked to breast cancer, as well as intervention studies focusing on the use of less toxic processes and substances, are limited. In what might be construed as a case of gender and social class bias, many research and funding agencies have ignored or downplayed the role of occupational studies despite their relevance to prevention efforts. Action required starts with making a national priority of promoting and supporting research on occupational and other environmental causes of breast cancer. Other public health actions include hazard surveillance and primary prevention activities such as reductions in the use of toxic materials, informed substitution, and green chemistry efforts.

21266443,An efficient hierarchical generalized linear mixed model for pathway analysis of genome-wide association studies.,"<h4>Motivation</h4>In genome-wide association studies (GWAS) of complex diseases, genetic variants having real but weak associations often fail to be detected at the stringent genome-wide significance level. Pathway analysis, which tests disease association with combined association signals from a group of variants in the same pathway, has become increasingly popular. However, because of the complexities in genetic data and the large sample sizes in typical GWAS, pathway analysis remains to be challenging. We propose a new statistical model for pathway analysis of GWAS. This model includes a fixed effects component that models mean disease association for a group of genes, and a random effects component that models how each gene's association with disease varies about the gene group mean, thus belongs to the class of mixed effects models.<h4>Results</h4>The proposed model is computationally efficient and uses only summary statistics. In addition, it corrects for the presence of overlapping genes and linkage disequilibrium (LD). Via simulated and real GWAS data, we showed our model improved power over currently available pathway analysis methods while preserving type I error rate. Furthermore, using the WTCCC Type 1 Diabetes (T1D) dataset, we demonstrated mixed model analysis identified meaningful biological processes that agreed well with previous reports on T1D. Therefore, the proposed methodology provides an efficient statistical modeling framework for systems analysis of GWAS.<h4>Availability</h4>The software code for mixed models analysis is freely available at http://biostat.mc.vanderbilt.edu/LilyWang.",0,
28537071,CLMSVault: A Software Suite for Protein Cross-Linking Mass-Spectrometry Data Analysis and Visualization.,"Protein cross-linking mass spectrometry (CL-MS) enables the sensitive detection of protein interactions and the inference of protein complex topology. The detection of chemical cross-links between protein residues can identify intra- and interprotein contact sites or provide physical constraints for molecular modeling of protein structure. Recent innovations in cross-linker design, sample preparation, mass spectrometry, and software tools have significantly improved CL-MS approaches. Although a number of algorithms now exist for the identification of cross-linked peptides from mass spectral data, a dearth of user-friendly analysis tools represent a practical bottleneck to the broad adoption of the approach. To facilitate the analysis of CL-MS data, we developed CLMSVault, a software suite designed to leverage existing CL-MS algorithms and provide intuitive and flexible tools for cross-platform data interpretation. CLMSVault stores and combines complementary information obtained from different cross-linkers and search algorithms. CLMSVault provides filtering, comparison, and visualization tools to support CL-MS analyses and includes a workflow for label-free quantification of cross-linked peptides. An embedded 3D viewer enables the visualization of quantitative data and the mapping of cross-linked sites onto PDB structural models. We demonstrate the application of CLMSVault for the analysis of a noncovalent Cdc34-ubiquitin protein complex cross-linked under different conditions.

As the number of experimentally verified bioactive peptides has increased significantly, various of in silico approaches are imperative for investigating the characteristics of ACPs. However, the lack of methods for investigating the differences in physicochemical properties of ACPs. In this study, we compared the N- and C-terminal amino acid composition for each peptide, there are three major subtypes of ACPs that are defined based on the distribution of positively charged residues. For the first time, we were motivated to develop a two-step machine learning model for identification of the subtypes of ACPs, which classify the input data into the corresponding group before applying the classifier. Further, to improve the predictive power, the hybrid feature sets were considered for prediction. Evaluation by five-fold cross-validation showed that the two-step model trained with sequence-based features and physicochemical properties was most effective in discriminating between ACPs and non-ACPs. The two-step model trained with the hybrid features performed well, with a sensitivity of 86.75%, a specificity of 85.75%, an accuracy of 86.08%, and a Matthews Correlation Coefficient value of 0.703. Furthermore, the model also consistently provides the effective performance in independent testing set, with sensitivity of 77.6%, specificity of 94.74%, accuracy of 88.99% and the MCC value reached 0.75.

33367514,BiCoN: Network-constrained biclustering of patients and omics data.,"<h4>Motivation</h4>Unsupervised learning approaches are frequently employed to stratify patients into clinically relevant subgroups and to identify biomarkers such as disease-associated genes. However, clustering and biclustering techniques are oblivious to the functional relationship of genes and are thus not ideally suited to pinpoint molecular mechanisms along with patient subgroups.<h4>Results</h4>We developed the network-constrained biclustering approach BiCoN (Biclustering Constrained by Networks) which (i) restricts biclusters to functionally related genes connected in molecular interaction networks and (ii) maximizes the difference in gene expression between two subgroups of patients. This allows BiCoN to simultaneously pinpoint molecular mechanisms responsible for the patient grouping. Network-constrained clustering of genes makes BiCoN more robust to noise and batch effects than typical clustering and biclustering methods. BiCoN can faithfully reproduce known disease subtypes as well as novel, clinically relevant patient subgroups, as we could demonstrate using breast and lung cancer datasets.

23394478,Multiple consensus trees: a method to separate divergent genes.,"<h4>Background</h4>It is generally admitted that the species tree cannot be inferred from the genetic sequences of a single gene because the evolution of different genes, and thus the gene tree topologies, may vary substantially. Gene trees can differ, for example, because of horizontal transfer events or because some of them correspond to paralogous instead of orthologous sequences. A variety of methods has been proposed to tackle the problem of the reconciliation of gene trees in order to reconstruct a species tree. When the taxa in all the trees are identical, the problem can be stated as a consensus tree problem.<h4>Results</h4>In this paper we define a new method for deciding whether a unique consensus tree or multiple consensus trees can best represent a set of given phylogenetic trees. If the given trees are all congruent, they should be compatible into a single consensus tree. Otherwise, several consensus trees corresponding to divergent genetic patterns can be identified. We introduce a method optimizing the generalized score, over a set of tree partitions in order to decide whether the given set of gene trees is homogeneous or not.<h4>Conclusions</h4>The proposed method has been validated with simulated data (random trees organized in three topological groups) as well as with real data (bootstrap trees, homogeneous set of trees, and a set of non homogeneous gene trees of 30 E. Coli strains; it is worth noting that some of the latter genes underwent horizontal gene transfers). A computer program, MCT - Multiple Consensus Trees, written in C was made freely available for the research community (it can be downloaded from http://bioinformatics.lif.univ-mrs.fr/consensus/index.html). It handles trees in a standard Newick format, builds three hierarchies corresponding to RF and QS similarities between trees and the greedy ascending algorithm. The generalized score values of all tree partitions are computed.",0,
32765587,ABC-GWAS: Functional Annotation of Estrogen Receptor-Positive Breast Cancer Genetic Variants.,"Over the past decade, hundreds of genome-wide association studies (GWAS) have implicated genetic variants in various diseases, including cancer. However, only a few of these variants have been functionally characterized to date, mainly because the majority of the variants reside in non-coding regions of the human genome with unknown function. A comprehensive functional annotation of the candidate variants is thus necessary to fill the gap between the correlative findings of GWAS and the development of therapeutic strategies. By integrating large-scale multi-omics datasets such as the Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) and the Encyclopedia of DNA Elements (ENCODE), we performed multivariate linear regression analysis of expression quantitative trait loci, sequence permutation test of transcription factor binding perturbation, and modeling of three-dimensional chromatin interactions to analyze the potential molecular functions of 2,813 single nucleotide variants in 93 genomic loci associated with estrogen receptor-positive breast cancer. To facilitate rapid progress in functional genomics of breast cancer, we have created ""Analysis of Breast Cancer GWAS"" (ABC-GWAS), an interactive database of functional annotation of estrogen receptor-positive breast cancer GWAS variants. Our resource includes expression quantitative trait loci, long-range chromatin interaction predictions, and transcription factor binding motif analyses to prioritize putative target genes, causal variants, and transcription factors. An embedded genome browser also facilitates convenient visualization of the GWAS loci in genomic and epigenomic context. ABC-GWAS provides an interactive visual summary of comprehensive functional characterization of estrogen receptor-positive breast cancer variants. The web resource will be useful to both computational and experimental biologists who wish to generate and test their hypotheses regarding the genetic susceptibility, etiology, and carcinogenesis of breast cancer. ABC-GWAS can also be used as a user-friendly educational resource for teaching functional genomics. ABC-GWAS is available at http://education.knoweng.org/abc-gwas/.",1,
31439548,Meflin-Positive Cancer-Associated Fibroblasts Inhibit Pancreatic Carcinogenesis.,"Cancer-associated fibroblasts (CAF) constitute a major component of the tumor microenvironment. Recent observations in genetically engineered mouse models and clinical studies have suggested that there may exist at least two functionally different populations of CAFs, that is, cancer-promoting CAFs (pCAF) and cancer-restraining CAFs (rCAF). Although various pCAF markers have been identified, the identity of rCAFs remains unknown because of the lack of rCAF-specific marker(s). In this study, we found that Meflin, a glycosylphosphatidylinositol-anchored protein that is a marker of mesenchymal stromal/stem cells and maintains their undifferentiated state, is expressed by pancreatic stellate cells that are a source of CAFs in pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC). <i>In situ</i> hybridization analysis of 71 human PDAC tissues revealed that the infiltration of Meflin-positive CAFs correlated with favorable patient outcome. Consistent herewith, Meflin deficiency led to significant tumor progression with poorly differentiated histology in a PDAC mouse model. Similarly, genetic ablation of Meflin-positive CAFs resulted in poor differentiation of tumors in a syngeneic transplantation model. Conversely, delivery of a Meflin-expressing lentivirus into the tumor stroma or overexpression of Meflin in CAFs suppressed the growth of xenograft tumors. Lineage tracing revealed that Meflin-positive cells gave rise to a-smooth muscle actin-positive CAFs that are positive or negative for Meflin, suggesting a mechanism for generating CAF heterogeneity. Meflin deficiency or low expression resulted in straightened stromal collagen fibers, which represent a signature for aggressive tumors, in mouse or human PDAC tissues, respectively. Together, the data suggest that Meflin is a marker of rCAFs that suppress PDAC progression. SIGNIFICANCE: Meflin marks and functionally contributes to a subset of cancer-associated fibroblasts that exert antitumoral effects.<b>Graphical Abstract:</b> http://cancerres.aacrjournals.org/content/canres/79/20/5367/F1.large.jpg.",0,
32175316,RF-PseU: A Random Forest Predictor for RNA Pseudouridine Sites.,"One of the ubiquitous chemical modifications in RNA, pseudouridine modification is crucial for various cellular biological and physiological processes. To gain more insight into the functional mechanisms involved, it is of fundamental importance to precisely identify pseudouridine sites in RNA. Several useful machine learning approaches have become available recently, with the increasing progress of next-generation sequencing technology; however, existing methods cannot predict sites with high accuracy. Thus, a more accurate predictor is required. In this study, a random forest-based predictor named RF-PseU is proposed for prediction of pseudouridylation sites. To optimize feature representation and obtain a better model, the light gradient boosting machine algorithm and incremental feature selection strategy were used to select the optimum feature space vector for training the random forest model RF-PseU. Compared with previous state-of-the-art predictors, the results on the same benchmark data sets of three species demonstrate that RF-PseU performs better overall. The integrated average leave-one-out cross-validation and independent testing accuracy scores were 71.4% and 74.7%, respectively, representing increments of 3.63% and 4.77% versus the best existing predictor. Moreover, the final RF-PseU model for prediction was built on leave-one-out cross-validation and provides a reliable and robust tool for identifying pseudouridine sites.

24580755,"CDSbank: taxonomy-aware extraction, selection, renaming and formatting of protein-coding DNA or amino acid sequences.","<h4>Background</h4>Protein-coding DNA sequences and their corresponding amino acid sequences are routinely used to study relationships between sequence, structure, function, and evolution. The rapidly growing size of sequence databases increases the power of such comparative analyses but it makes it more challenging to prepare high quality sequence data sets with control over redundancy, quality, completeness, formatting, and labeling. Software tools for some individual steps in this process exist but manual intervention remains a common and time consuming necessity.<h4>Description</h4>CDSbank is a database that stores both the protein-coding DNA sequence (CDS) and amino acid sequence for each protein annotated in Genbank. CDSbank also stores Genbank feature annotation, a flag to indicate incomplete 5' and 3' ends, full taxonomic data, and a heuristic to rank the scientific interest of each species. This rich information allows fully automated data set preparation with a level of sophistication that aims to meet or exceed manual processing. Defaults ensure ease of use for typical scenarios while allowing great flexibility when needed. Access is via a free web server at http://hazeslab.med.ualberta.ca/CDSbank/.<h4>Conclusions</h4>CDSbank presents a user-friendly web server to download, filter, format, and name large sequence data sets. Common usage scenarios can be accessed via pre-programmed default choices, while optional sections give full control over the processing pipeline. Particular strengths are: extract protein-coding DNA sequences just as easily as amino acid sequences, full access to taxonomy for labeling and filtering, awareness of incomplete sequences, and the ability to take one protein sequence and extract all synonymous CDS or identical protein sequences in other species. Finally, CDSbank can also create labeled property files to, for instance, annotate or re-label phylogenetic trees.",1,
26628858,Characterizing Cancer-Specific Networks by Integrating TCGA Data.,"The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) generates comprehensive genomic data for thousands of patients over more than 20 cancer types. TCGA data are typically whole-genome measurements of multiple genomic features, such as DNA copy numbers, DNA methylation, and gene expression, providing unique opportunities for investigating cancer mechanism from multiple molecular and regulatory layers. We propose a Bayesian graphical model to systemically integrate multi-platform TCGA data for inference of the interactions between different genomic features either within a gene or between multiple genes. The presence or absence of edges in the graph indicates the presence or absence of conditional dependence between genomic features. The inference is restricted to genes within a known biological network, but can be extended to any sets of genes. Applying the model to the same genes using patient samples in two different cancer types, we identify network components that are common as well as different between cancer types.

32081774,Discovery and development of safe-in-man broad-spectrum antiviral agents.,"Viral diseases are one of the leading causes of morbidity and mortality in the world. Virus-specific vaccines and antiviral drugs are the most powerful tools to combat viral diseases. However, broad-spectrum antiviral agents (BSAAs, i.e. compounds targeting viruses belonging to two or more viral families) could provide additional protection of the general population from emerging and re-emerging viral diseases, reinforcing the arsenal of available antiviral options. Here, we review discovery and development of BSAAs and summarize the information on 120 safe-in-man agents in a freely accessible database (https://drugvirus.info/). Future and ongoing pre-clinical and clinical studies will increase the number of BSAAs, expand the spectrum of their indications, and identify drug combinations for treatment of emerging and re-emerging viral infections as well as co-infections.",1,
21467568,Increasing power of genome-wide association studies by collecting additional single-nucleotide polymorphisms.,"Genome-wide association studies (GWASs) have been effectively identifying the genomic regions associated with a disease trait. In a typical GWAS, an informative subset of the single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs), called tag SNPs, is genotyped in case/control individuals. Once the tag SNP statistics are computed, the genomic regions that are in linkage disequilibrium (LD) with the most significantly associated tag SNPs are believed to contain the causal polymorphisms. However, such LD regions are often large and contain many additional polymorphisms. Following up all the SNPs included in these regions is costly and infeasible for biological validation. In this article we address how to characterize these regions cost effectively with the goal of providing investigators a clear direction for biological validation. We introduce a follow-up study approach for identifying all untyped associated SNPs by selecting additional SNPs, called follow-up SNPs, from the associated regions and genotyping them in the original case/control individuals. We introduce a novel SNP selection method with the goal of maximizing the number of associated SNPs among the chosen follow-up SNPs. We show how the observed statistics of the original tag SNPs and human genetic variation reference data such as the HapMap Project can be utilized to identify the follow-up SNPs. We use simulated and real association studies based on the HapMap data and the Wellcome Trust Case Control Consortium to demonstrate that our method shows superior performance to the correlation- and distance-based traditional follow-up SNP selection approaches. Our method is publicly available at http://genetics.cs.ucla.edu/followupSNPs.",0,
22824207,ACPYPE - AnteChamber PYthon Parser interfacE.,"<h4>Background</h4>ACPYPE (or AnteChamber PYthon Parser interfacE) is a wrapper script around the ANTECHAMBER software that simplifies the generation of small molecule topologies and parameters for a variety of molecular dynamics programmes like GROMACS, CHARMM and CNS. It is written in the Python programming language and was developed as a tool for interfacing with other Python based applications such as the CCPN software suite (for NMR data analysis) and ARIA (for structure calculations from NMR data). ACPYPE is open source code, under GNU GPL v3, and is available as a stand-alone application at http://www.ccpn.ac.uk/acpype and as a web portal application at http://webapps.ccpn.ac.uk/acpype.<h4>Findings</h4>We verified the topologies generated by ACPYPE in three ways: by comparing with default AMBER topologies for standard amino acids; by generating and verifying topologies for a large set of ligands from the PDB; and by recalculating the structures for 5 protein-ligand complexes from the PDB.<h4>Conclusions</h4>ACPYPE is a tool that simplifies the automatic generation of topology and parameters in different formats for different molecular mechanics programmes, including calculation of partial charges, while being object oriented for integration with other applications.",0,
23433959,Identification of candidate transcription factor binding sites in the cattle genome.,"A resource that provides candidate transcription factor binding sites (TFBSs) does not currently exist for cattle. Such data is necessary, as predicted sites may serve as excellent starting locations for future omics studies to develop transcriptional regulation hypotheses. In order to generate this resource, we employed a phylogenetic footprinting approach-using sequence conservation across cattle, human and dog-and position-specific scoring matrices to identify 379,333 putative TFBSs upstream of nearly 8000 Mammalian Gene Collection (MGC) annotated genes within the cattle genome. Comparisons of our predictions to known binding site loci within the PCK1, ACTA1 and G6PC promoter regions revealed 75% sensitivity for our method of discovery. Additionally, we intersected our predictions with known cattle SNP variants in dbSNP and on the Illumina BovineHD 770k and Bos 1 SNP chips, finding 7534, 444 and 346 overlaps, respectively. Due to our stringent filtering criteria, these results represent high quality predictions of putative TFBSs within the cattle genome.

22912585,Dissecting the gene network of dietary restriction to identify evolutionarily conserved pathways and new functional genes.,"Dietary restriction (DR), limiting nutrient intake from diet without causing malnutrition, delays the aging process and extends lifespan in multiple organisms. The conserved life-extending effect of DR suggests the involvement of fundamental mechanisms, although these remain a subject of debate. To help decipher the life-extending mechanisms of DR, we first compiled a list of genes that if genetically altered disrupt or prevent the life-extending effects of DR. We called these DR-essential genes and identified more than 100 in model organisms such as yeast, worms, flies, and mice. In order for other researchers to benefit from this first curated list of genes essential for DR, we established an online database called GenDR (http://genomics.senescence.info/diet/). To dissect the interactions of DR-essential genes and discover the underlying lifespan-extending mechanisms, we then used a variety of network and systems biology approaches to analyze the gene network of DR. We show that DR-essential genes are more conserved at the molecular level and have more molecular interactions than expected by chance. Furthermore, we employed a guilt-by-association method to predict novel DR-essential genes. In budding yeast, we predicted nine genes related to vacuolar functions; we show experimentally that mutations deleting eight of those genes prevent the life-extending effects of DR. Three of these mutants (OPT2, FRE6, and RCR2) had extended lifespan under ad libitum, indicating that the lack of further longevity under DR is not caused by a general compromise of fitness. These results demonstrate how network analyses of DR using GenDR can be used to make phenotypically relevant predictions. Moreover, gene-regulatory circuits reveal that the DR-induced transcriptional signature in yeast involves nutrient-sensing, stress responses and meiotic transcription factors. Finally, comparing the influence of gene expression changes during DR on the interactomes of multiple organisms led us to suggest that DR commonly suppresses translation, while stimulating an ancient reproduction-related process.",1,
30200994,TAP: a targeted clinical genomics pipeline for detecting transcript variants using RNA-seq data.,"<h4>Background</h4>RNA-seq is a powerful and cost-effective technology for molecular diagnostics of cancer and other diseases, and it can reach its full potential when coupled with validated clinical-grade informatics tools. Despite recent advances in long-read sequencing, transcriptome assembly of short reads remains a useful and cost-effective methodology for unveiling transcript-level rearrangements and novel isoforms. One of the major concerns for adopting the proven de novo assembly approach for RNA-seq data in clinical settings has been the analysis turnaround time. To address this concern, we have developed a targeted approach to expedite assembly and analysis of RNA-seq data.<h4>Results</h4>Here we present our Targeted Assembly Pipeline (TAP), which consists of four stages: 1) alignment-free gene-level classification of RNA-seq reads using BioBloomTools, 2) de novo assembly of individual targets using Trans-ABySS, 3) alignment of assembled contigs to the reference genome and transcriptome with GMAP and BWA and 4) structural and splicing variant detection using PAVFinder. We show that PAVFinder is a robust gene fusion detection tool when compared to established methods such as Tophat-Fusion and deFuse on simulated data of 448 events. Using the Leucegene acute myeloid leukemia (AML) RNA-seq data and a set of 580 COSMIC target genes, TAP identified a wide range of hallmark molecular anomalies including gene fusions, tandem duplications, insertions and deletions in agreement with published literature results. Moreover, also in this dataset, TAP captured AML-specific splicing variants such as skipped exons and novel splice sites reported in studies elsewhere. Running time of TAP on 100-150 million read pairs and a 580-gene set is one to 2 hours on a 48-core machine.<h4>Conclusions</h4>We demonstrated that TAP is a fast and robust RNA-seq variant detection pipeline that is potentially amenable to clinical applications.

The identification of protein-coding genes is often based on transcriptome sequencing data, ab-initio or homology-based prediction. Recently, it was demonstrated that intron position conservation improves homology-based gene prediction, and that experimental data improves ab-initio gene prediction.<h4>Results</h4>Here, we present an extension of the gene prediction program GeMoMa that utilizes amino acid sequence conservation, intron position conservation and optionally RNA-seq data for homology-based gene prediction. We show on published benchmark data for plants, animals and fungi that GeMoMa performs better than the gene prediction programs BRAKER1, MAKER2, and CodingQuarry, and purely RNA-seq-based pipelines for transcript identification. In addition, we demonstrate that using multiple reference organisms may help to further improve the performance of GeMoMa. Finally, we apply GeMoMa to four nematode species and to the recently published barley reference genome indicating that current annotations of protein-coding genes may be refined using GeMoMa predictions.<h4>Conclusions</h4>GeMoMa might be of great utility for annotating newly sequenced genomes but also for finding homologs of a specific gene or gene family.

22086951,The UCSC Genome Browser database: extensions and updates 2011.,"The University of California Santa Cruz Genome Browser (http://genome.ucsc.edu) offers online public access to a growing database of genomic sequence and annotations for a wide variety of organisms. The Browser is an integrated tool set for visualizing, comparing, analyzing and sharing both publicly available and user-generated genomic data sets. In the past year, the local database has been updated with four new species assemblies, and we anticipate another four will be released by the end of 2011. Further, a large number of annotation tracks have been either added, updated by contributors, or remapped to the latest human reference genome. Among these are new phenotype and disease annotations, UCSC genes, and a major dbSNP update, which required new visualization methods. Growing beyond the local database, this year we have introduced 'track data hubs', which allow the Genome Browser to provide access to remotely located sets of annotations.

26109357,Gene Model Annotations for Drosophila melanogaster: Impact of High-Throughput Data.,"We report the current status of the FlyBase annotated gene set for Drosophila melanogaster and highlight improvements based on high-throughput data. The FlyBase annotated gene set consists entirely of manually annotated gene models, with the exception of some classes of small non-coding RNAs. All gene models have been reviewed using evidence from high-throughput datasets, primarily from the modENCODE project. These datasets include RNA-Seq coverage data, RNA-Seq junction data, transcription start site profiles, and translation stop-codon read-through predictions. New annotation guidelines were developed to take into account the use of the high-throughput data. We describe how this flood of new data was incorporated into thousands of new and revised annotations. FlyBase has adopted a philosophy of excluding low-confidence and low-frequency data from gene model annotations; we also do not attempt to represent all possible permutations for complex and modularly organized genes. This has allowed us to produce a high-confidence, manageable gene annotation dataset that is available at FlyBase (http://flybase.org). Interesting aspects of new annotations include new genes (coding, non-coding, and antisense), many genes with alternative transcripts with very long 3' UTRs (up to 15-18 kb), and a stunning mismatch in the number of male-specific genes (approximately 13% of all annotated gene models) vs. female-specific genes (less than 1%). The number of identified pseudogenes and mutations in the sequenced strain also increased significantly. We discuss remaining challenges, for instance, identification of functional small polypeptides and detection of alternative translation starts.",1,

Policies of ""tight"" glycaemic control were rapidly adopted by many general intensive care units (ICUs) worldwide in the mid 00's, even though the results of the studies were not generalizable to mixed medical/surgical ICUs with different intravenous feeding policies. OBJECTIVE:The primary objective of the study is to assess the safety of mandatory insulin infusion in critically ill patients in a general ICU setting. METHODS:This protocol summarizes the rationale and design of a randomized, controlled, single-center trial investigating the effect of mandatory insulin therapy versus usual care insulin therapy for those patients admitted for a stay of longer than 48 hours. In total, 109 critically ill adults predicted to stay in intensive care for longer than 48 hours consented. The primary outcome is to determine the safety of mandatory insulin therapy in critically ill patients using the number of episodes of hypoglycaemia and hypokalaemia per unit length of stay in intensive care. Secondary outcomes include the duration of mechanical ventilation, duration of ICU and hospital stay, hospital mortality, and measures of renal, hepatic, and haematological dysfunction. RESULTS:The project was funded in 2005 and enrolment was completed 2007. Data analysis is currently underway and the first results are expected to be submitted for publication in 2018. CONCLUSIONS:This protocol for a randomized controlled trial investigating the effect of mandatory insulin therapy should provide an answer to a key question for the management of patients in the ICU and ultimately improving outcome.

30239574,A clustering linear combination approach to jointly analyze multiple phenotypes for GWAS.,"<h4>Summary</h4>There is an increasing interest in joint analysis of multiple phenotypes for genome-wide association studies (GWASs) based on the following reasons. First, cohorts usually collect multiple phenotypes and complex diseases are usually measured by multiple correlated intermediate phenotypes. Second, jointly analyzing multiple phenotypes may increase statistical power for detecting genetic variants associated with complex diseases. Third, there is increasing evidence showing that pleiotropy is a widespread phenomenon in complex diseases. In this paper, we develop a clustering linear combination (CLC) method to jointly analyze multiple phenotypes for GWASs. In the CLC method, we first cluster individual statistics into positively correlated clusters and then, combine the individual statistics linearly within each cluster and combine the between-cluster terms in a quadratic form. CLC is not only robust to different signs of the means of individual statistics, but also reduce the degrees of freedom of the test statistic. We also theoretically prove that if we can cluster the individual statistics correctly, CLC is the most powerful test among all tests with certain quadratic forms.

27878809,Telephone-assisted self-help for parents of children with attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder who have residual functional impairment despite methylphenidate treatment: a randomized controlled trial.,"<h4>Background</h4>Self-help parenting interventions have been shown to be effective in the management of children with attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) and may be useful when there are barriers to face-to-face therapist-led parent trainings. Previous studies indicate that behavioral interventions might be a useful adjunct to medication in children with residual ADHD symptoms, and regarding comorbid oppositional symptoms and multiple domains of functional impairment. In the present study, we examined whether a telephone-assisted self-help (TASH) parenting behavioral intervention (written materials plus telephone counseling) enhanced the effects of methylphenidate treatment in children with ADHD.<h4>Methods</h4>In this randomized controlled trial, parents of 103 school-aged children with ADHD and residual functional impairment despite methylphenidate treatment were randomly assigned to either the enhancement group, which received the TASH intervention as adjunct to routine clinical care (including continued medication), or to the active control group, which received routine clinical care only (including continued medication). Parent-completed outcome measures at baseline and at 12†months (postassessment) included functional impairment, ADHD symptoms, oppositional defiant disorder (ODD) symptoms, parenting behavior, and parental satisfaction with the intervention (ClinicalTrials.gov: NCT01660425; URL: https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT01660425).<h4>Results</h4>Intention-to-treat analyses of covariance (ANCOVAs), which controlled for baseline data, revealed significant and moderate intervention effects for ODD symptoms and negative parenting behavior at the postassessment, whereas per-protocol analyses additionally showed significant and moderate effects on functional impairment (primary outcome). Parents expressed high satisfaction with the program.<h4>Conclusions</h4>The TASH program enhances effects of methylphenidate treatment in families who complete the intervention. The†discontinuation rate of about 30% and comparison between completing and discontinuing families suggest that the program may be more suitable for families with a higher educational level and fewer additional stresses.",0,
21880147,An integrative approach to ortholog prediction for disease-focused and other functional studies.,"<h4>Background</h4>Mapping of orthologous genes among species serves an important role in functional genomics by allowing researchers to develop hypotheses about gene function in one species based on what is known about the functions of orthologs in other species. Several tools for predicting orthologous gene relationships are available. However, these tools can give different results and identification of predicted orthologs is not always straightforward.<h4>Results</h4>We report a simple but effective tool, the Drosophila RNAi Screening Center Integrative Ortholog Prediction Tool (DIOPT; http://www.flyrnai.org/diopt), for rapid identification of orthologs. DIOPT integrates existing approaches, facilitating rapid identification of orthologs among human, mouse, zebrafish, C. elegans, Drosophila, and S. cerevisiae. As compared to individual tools, DIOPT shows increased sensitivity with only a modest decrease in specificity. Moreover, the flexibility built into the DIOPT graphical user interface allows researchers with different goals to appropriately 'cast a wide net' or limit results to highest confidence predictions. DIOPT also displays protein and domain alignments, including percent amino acid identity, for predicted ortholog pairs. This helps users identify the most appropriate matches among multiple possible orthologs. To facilitate using model organisms for functional analysis of human disease-associated genes, we used DIOPT to predict high-confidence orthologs of disease genes in Online Mendelian Inheritance in Man (OMIM) and genes in genome-wide association study (GWAS) data sets. The results are accessible through the DIOPT diseases and traits query tool (DIOPT-DIST; http://www.flyrnai.org/diopt-dist).<h4>Conclusions</h4>DIOPT and DIOPT-DIST are useful resources for researchers working with model organisms, especially those who are interested in exploiting model organisms such as Drosophila to study the functions of human disease genes.",1,
24163255,The pancreatic expression database: recent extensions and updates.,"The Pancreatic Expression Database (PED, http://www.pancreasexpression.org) is the only device currently available for mining of pancreatic cancer literature data. It brings together the largest collection of multidimensional pancreatic data from the literature including genomic, proteomic, microRNA, methylomic and transcriptomic profiles. PED allows the user to ask specific questions on the observed levels of deregulation among a broad range of specimen/experimental types including healthy/patient tissue and body fluid specimens, cell lines and murine models as well as related treatments/drugs data. Here we provide an update to PED, which has been previously featured in the Database issue of this journal. Briefly, PED data content has been substantially increased and expanded to cover methylomics studies. We introduced an extensive controlled vocabulary that records specific details on the samples and added data from large-scale meta-analysis studies. The web interface has been improved/redesigned with a quick search option to rapidly extract information about a gene/protein of interest and an upload option allowing users to add their own data to PED. We added a user guide and implemented integrated graphical tools to overlay and visualize retrieved information. Interoperability with biomart-compatible data sets was significantly improved to allow integrative queries with pancreatic cancer data.",1,
22454131,Revealing mammalian evolutionary relationships by comparative analysis of gene clusters.,"Many software tools for comparative analysis of genomic sequence data have been released in recent decades. Despite this, it remains challenging to determine evolutionary relationships in gene clusters due to their complex histories involving duplications, deletions, inversions, and conversions. One concept describing these relationships is orthology. Orthologs derive from a common ancestor by speciation, in contrast to paralogs, which derive from duplication. Discriminating orthologs from paralogs is a necessary step in most multispecies sequence analyses, but doing so accurately is impeded by the occurrence of gene conversion events. We propose a refined method of orthology assignment based on two paradigms for interpreting its definition: by genomic context or by sequence content. X-orthology (based on context) traces orthology resulting from speciation and duplication only, while N-orthology (based on content) includes the influence of conversion events. We developed a computational method for automatically mapping both types of orthology on a per-nucleotide basis in gene cluster regions studied by comparative sequencing, and we make this mapping accessible by visualizing the output. All of these steps are incorporated into our newly extended CHAP 2 package. We evaluate our method using both simulated data and real gene clusters (including the well-characterized a-globin and ﬂ-globin clusters). We also illustrate use of CHAP 2 by analyzing four more loci: CCL (chemokine ligand), IFN (interferon), CYP2abf (part of cytochrome P450 family 2), and KIR (killer cell immunoglobulin-like receptors). These new methods facilitate and extend our understanding of evolution at these and other loci by adding automated accurate evolutionary inference to the biologist's toolkit.

30219490,Changing labour market conditions during the 'great recession' and mental health in Scotland 2007-2011: an example using the Scottish Longitudinal Study and data for local areas in Scotland.,"This paper reports research exploring how trends in local labour market conditions during the period 2007-2011 (early stages of the 'great recession') relate to reported mental illness for individuals. It contributes to research on spatio-temporal variation in the wider determinants of health, exploring how the lifecourse of places relates to socio-geographical inequalities in health outcomes for individuals. This study also contributes to the renewed research focus on the links between labour market trends and population health, prompted by the recent global economic recession. We report research using the Scottish Longitudinal Study (SLS), a 5.3% representative sample of the Scottish population, derived from census data (https://sls.lscs.ac.uk/). In Scotland, (2011) census data include self-reported mental health. SLS data were combined with non-disclosive information from other sources, including spatio-temporal trends in labour market conditions (calculated using trajectory modelling) in the 32 local authority areas in Scotland. We show that, for groups of local authorities in Scotland over the period 2007-2011, trends in employment varied. These geographically variable trends in employment rates were associated with inequalities in self-reported mental health across the country, after controlling for a number of other individual and neighbourhood risk factors. For residents of regions that had experienced relatively high and stable levels of employment the odds ratio for reporting a mental illness was significantly lower than for the 'reference group', living in areas with persistently low employment rates. In areas where employment declined markedly from higher levels, the odds ratio was similar to the reference group. The findings emphasise how changes in local economic conditions may influence people's health and wellbeing independently of their own employment status. We conclude that, during the recent recession, the economic life course of places across Scotland has been associated with individual mental health outcomes.",0,
22836712,A comparative cellular and molecular biology of longevity database.,"Discovering key cellular and molecular traits that promote longevity is a major goal of aging and longevity research. One experimental strategy is to determine which traits have been selected during the evolution of longevity in naturally long-lived animal species. This comparative approach has been applied to lifespan research for nearly four decades, yielding hundreds of datasets describing aspects of cell and molecular biology hypothesized to relate to animal longevity. Here, we introduce a Comparative Cellular and Molecular Biology of Longevity Database, available at ( http://genomics.brocku.ca/ccmbl/ ), as a compendium of comparative cell and molecular data presented in the context of longevity. This open access database will facilitate the meta-analysis of amalgamated datasets using standardized maximum lifespan (MLSP) data (from AnAge). The first edition contains over 800 data records describing experimental measurements of cellular stress resistance, reactive oxygen species metabolism, membrane composition, protein homeostasis, and genome homeostasis as they relate to vertebrate species MLSP. The purpose of this review is to introduce the database and briefly demonstrate its use in the meta-analysis of combined datasets.",1,
28812439,Evaluating disease prediction models using a cohort whose covariate distribution differs from that of the target population.,"Personal predictive models for disease development play important roles in chronic disease prevention. The performance of these models is evaluated by applying them to the baseline covariates of participants in external cohort studies, with model predictions compared to subjects' subsequent disease incidence. However, the covariate distribution among participants in a validation cohort may differ from that of the population for which the model will be used. Since estimates of predictive model performance depend on the distribution of covariates among the subjects to which it is applied, such differences can cause misleading estimates of model performance in the target population. We propose a method for addressing this problem by weighting the cohort subjects to make their covariate distribution better match that of the target population. Simulations show that the method provides accurate estimates of model performance in the target population, while un-weighted estimates may not. We illustrate the method by applying it to evaluate an ovarian cancer prediction model targeted to US women, using cohort data from participants in the California Teachers Study. The methods can be implemented using open-source code for public use as the R-package RMAP (Risk Model Assessment Package) available at http://stanford.edu/~ggong/rmap/ .",0,

IntAct has developed a sophisticated web-based curation tool, capable of supporting both IMEx- and MIMIx-level curation. This tool is now utilized by multiple additional curation teams, all of whom annotate data directly into the IntAct database. Members of the IntAct team supply appropriate levels of training, perform quality control on entries and take responsibility for long-term data maintenance. Recently, the MINT and IntAct databases decided to merge their separate efforts to make optimal use of limited developer resources and maximize the curation output. All data manually curated by the MINT curators have been moved into the IntAct database at EMBL-EBI and are merged with the existing IntAct dataset.

27604408,ExonImpact: Prioritizing Pathogenic Alternative Splicing Events.,"Alternative splicing (AS) is a closely regulated process that allows a single gene to encode multiple protein isoforms, thereby contributing to the diversity of the proteome. Dysregulation of the splicing process has been found to be associated with many inherited diseases. However, among the pathogenic AS events, there are numerous ""passenger"" events whose inclusion or exclusion does not lead to significant changes with respect to protein function. In this study, we evaluate the secondary and tertiary structural features of proteins associated with disease-causing and neutral AS events, and show that several structural features are strongly associated with the pathological impact of exon inclusion. We further develop a machine-learning-based computational model, ExonImpact, for prioritizing and evaluating the functional consequences of hitherto uncharacterized AS events. We evaluated our model using several strategies including cross-validation, and data from the Gene-Tissue Expression (GTEx) and ClinVar databases.

28968848,A comprehensive assessment of long intrinsic protein disorder from the DisProt database.,"<h4>Motivation</h4>Intrinsic disorder (ID), i.e. the lack of a unique folded conformation at physiological conditions, is a common feature for many proteins, which requires specialized biochemical experiments that are not high-throughput. Missing X-ray residues from the PDB have been widely used as a proxy for ID when developing computational methods. This may lead to a systematic bias, where predictors deviate from biologically relevant ID. Large benchmarking sets on experimentally validated ID are scarce. Recently, the DisProt database has been renewed and expanded to include manually curated ID annotations for several hundred new proteins. This provides a large benchmark set which has not yet been used for training ID predictors.<h4>Results</h4>Here, we describe the first systematic benchmarking of ID predictors on the new DisProt dataset. In contrast to previous assessments based on missing X-ray data, this dataset contains mostly long ID regions and a significant amount of fully ID proteins. The benchmarking shows that ID predictors work quite well on the new dataset, especially for long ID segments. However, a large fraction of ID still goes virtually undetected and the ranking of methods is different than for PDB data. In particular, many predictors appear to confound ID and regions outside X-ray structures. This suggests that the ID prediction methods capture different flavors of disorder and can benefit from highly accurate curated examples.<h4>Availability and implementation</h4>The raw data used for the evaluation are available from URL: http://www.disprot.org/assessment/.<h4>Contact</h4>silvio.tosatto@unipd.it.<h4>Supplementary information</h4>Supplementary data are available at Bioinformatics online.",1,
27509041,MMpI: A WideRange of Available Compounds of Matrix Metalloproteinase Inhibitors.,"Matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs) are a family of zinc-dependent proteinases involved in the regulation of the extracellular signaling and structural matrix environment of cells and tissues. MMPs are considered as promising targets for the treatment of many diseases. Therefore, creation of database on the inhibitors of MMP would definitely accelerate the research activities in this area due to its implication in above-mentioned diseases and associated limitations in the first and second generation inhibitors. In this communication, we report the development of a new MMpI database which provides resourceful information for all researchers working in this field. It is a web-accessible, unique resource that contains detailed information on the inhibitors of MMP including small molecules, peptides and MMP Drug Leads. The database contains entries of ~3000 inhibitors including ~72 MMP Drug Leads and ~73 peptide based inhibitors.

We have investigated the in vivo pharmacology of a novel buprenorphine analogue, BU10119, for the first time.<h4>Experimental approach</h4>To determine the opioid pharmacology of BU10119 (0.3-3†mg∑kg<sup>-1</sup> , i.p.) in vivo, the warm-water tail-withdrawal assay was applied in adult male CD1 mice. A range of behavioural paradigms was used to investigate the locomotor effects, rewarding properties and antidepressant or anxiolytic potential of BU10119. Additional groups of mice were exposed to a single (1†◊†2†h) or repeated restraint stress (3◊ daily 2†h) to determine the ability of BU10119 to block stress-induced analgesia.<h4>Key results</h4>BU10119 alone was without any antinociceptive activity. BU10119 (1†mg∑kg<sup>-1</sup> ) was able to block U50,488, buprenorphine and morphine-induced antinociception. The <U+03BA> antagonist effects of BU10119 in the tail-withdrawal assay reversed between 24 and 48†h. BU10119 was without significant locomotor or rewarding effects. BU10119 (1†mg∑kg<sup>-1</sup> ) significantly reduced the latency to feed in the novelty-induced hypophagia task and reduced immobility time in the forced swim test, compared to saline-treated animals. There were no significant effects of BU10119 in either the elevated plus maze or the light-dark box. Both acute and repeated restraint stress-induced analgesia were blocked by pretreatment with BU10119 (1†mg∑kg<sup>-1</sup> ). Parallel stress-induced increases in plasma corticosterone were not affected.<h4>Conclusions and implications</h4>BU10119 is a mixed <U+03BA>/µ receptor antagonist with relatively short-duration <U+03BA> antagonist activity. Based on these preclinical data, BU10119 has therapeutic potential for the treatment of depression and other stress-induced conditions.<h4>Linked articles</h4>This article is part of a themed section on Emerging Areas of Opioid Pharmacology.

27841751,A public database of macromolecular diffraction experiments.,"The low reproducibility of published experimental results in many scientific disciplines has recently garnered negative attention in scientific journals and the general media. Public transparency, including the availability of `raw' experimental data, will help to address growing concerns regarding scientific integrity. Macromolecular X-ray crystallography has led the way in requiring the public dissemination of atomic coordinates and a wealth of experimental data, making the field one of the most reproducible in the biological sciences. However, there remains no mandate for public disclosure of the original diffraction data. The Integrated Resource for Reproducibility in Macromolecular Crystallography (IRRMC) has been developed to archive raw data from diffraction experiments and, equally importantly, to provide related metadata. Currently, the database of our resource contains data from 2920 macromolecular diffraction experiments (5767 data sets), accounting for around 3% of all depositions in the Protein Data Bank (PDB), with their corresponding partially curated metadata. IRRMC utilizes distributed storage implemented using a federated architecture of many independent storage servers, which provides both scalability and sustainability. The resource, which is accessible via the web portal at http://www.proteindiffraction.org, can be searched using various criteria. All data are available for unrestricted access and download. The resource serves as a proof of concept and demonstrates the feasibility of archiving raw diffraction data and associated metadata from X-ray crystallographic studies of biological macromolecules. The goal is to expand this resource and include data sets that failed to yield X-ray structures in order to facilitate collaborative efforts that will improve protein structure-determination methods and to ensure the availability of `orphan' data left behind for various reasons by individual investigators and/or extinct structural genomics projects.",1,
21703007,PlantPhos: using maximal dependence decomposition to identify plant phosphorylation sites with substrate site specificity.,"<h4>Background</h4>Protein phosphorylation catalyzed by kinases plays crucial regulatory roles in intracellular signal transduction. Due to the difficulty in performing high-throughput mass spectrometry-based experiment, there is a desire to predict phosphorylation sites using computational methods. However, previous studies regarding in silico prediction of plant phosphorylation sites lack the consideration of kinase-specific phosphorylation data. Thus, we are motivated to propose a new method that investigates different substrate specificities in plant phosphorylation sites.<h4>Results</h4>Experimentally verified phosphorylation data were extracted from TAIR9-a protein database containing 3006 phosphorylation data from the plant species Arabidopsis thaliana. In an attempt to investigate the various substrate motifs in plant phosphorylation, maximal dependence decomposition (MDD) is employed to cluster a large set of phosphorylation data into subgroups containing significantly conserved motifs. Profile hidden Markov model (HMM) is then applied to learn a predictive model for each subgroup. Cross-validation evaluation on the MDD-clustered HMMs yields an average accuracy of 82.4% for serine, 78.6% for threonine, and 89.0% for tyrosine models. Moreover, independent test results using Arabidopsis thaliana phosphorylation data from UniProtKB/Swiss-Prot show that the proposed models are able to correctly predict 81.4% phosphoserine, 77.1% phosphothreonine, and 83.7% phosphotyrosine sites. Interestingly, several MDD-clustered subgroups are observed to have similar amino acid conservation with the substrate motifs of well-known kinases from Phospho.ELM-a database containing kinase-specific phosphorylation data from multiple organisms.<h4>Conclusions</h4>This work presents a novel method for identifying plant phosphorylation sites with various substrate motifs. Based on cross-validation and independent testing, results show that the MDD-clustered models outperform models trained without using MDD. The proposed method has been implemented as a web-based plant phosphorylation prediction tool, PlantPhos http://csb.cse.yzu.edu.tw/PlantPhos/. Additionally, two case studies have been demonstrated to further evaluate the effectiveness of PlantPhos.",0,

22638583,"Seq2Logo: a method for construction and visualization of amino acid binding motifs and sequence profiles including sequence weighting, pseudo counts and two-sided representation of amino acid enrichment and depletion.","Seq2Logo is a web-based sequence logo generator. Sequence logos are a graphical representation of the information content stored in a multiple sequence alignment (MSA) and provide a compact and highly intuitive representation of the position-specific amino acid composition of binding motifs, active sites, etc. in biological sequences. Accurate generation of sequence logos is often compromised by sequence redundancy and low number of observations. Moreover, most methods available for sequence logo generation focus on displaying the position-specific enrichment of amino acids, discarding the equally valuable information related to amino acid depletion. Seq2logo aims at resolving these issues allowing the user to include sequence weighting to correct for data redundancy, pseudo counts to correct for low number of observations and different logotype representations each capturing different aspects related to amino acid enrichment and depletion. Besides allowing input in the format of peptides and MSA, Seq2Logo accepts input as Blast sequence profiles, providing easy access for non-expert end-users to characterize and identify functionally conserved/variable amino acids in any given protein of interest.

29956198,Prognostic Impact of Extracapsular Lymph Node Invasion on Survival in Non-small-Cell Lung Cancer: A Systematic Review and Meta-analysis.,"The extracapsular tumor extension (ECE) of nodal metastasis is an important prognostic factor in different types of malignancies. However, there is a lack of recent data in patients with non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC). In addition, the TNM staging system does not include ECE status as a prognostic factor. This systematic review and meta-analysis has been conducted to summarize and pool existing data to determine the prognostic role of ECE in patients with lymph node-positive NSCLC. Two authors performed an independent search in PubMed using a predefined keyword list, without language restrictions with publication date since 1990. Prospective or retrospective studies reporting data on prognostic parameters in subjects with NSCLC with positive ECE or with only intracapsular lymph node metastasis were retrieved. Data were summarized using risk ratios (RR) for the survival with 95% confidence intervals (CI). The data was analyzed using Mix 2 (ref: Bax L: MIX 2.0 - Professional software for meta-analysis in Excel. Version 2.015. BiostatXL, 2016. https://www.meta-analysis-made-easy.com ). There 2,105 studies were reviewed. Five studies covering a total of 828 subjects met the inclusion criteria and were included in the meta-analysis. Two hundred and ninety-eight (35.9%) patients were categorized as ECE+, of whom 54 (18.1%) survived at the end of follow-up. In the ECE-negative group, 257 patients (48.4%) survived by the end of follow-up. Thus, ECE status is associated with a significantly decreased survival rate: pooled RR 0.45 (95% CI 0.35-0.59), Q <sub>(4)</sub>†=†4.06, P <sub>value</sub>†=†0.39, and I <sup>2</sup>†=†68.00% (95 CI 0.00-79.55%). In conclusion, ECE has a significant impact on survival in NSCLC patients and should be considered in diagnostic and therapeutic decisions in addition to the current TNM staging. Postoperative radiotherapy may be an option in ECE-positive pN1 NSCLC patients.",0,
34043002,Identification of evolutionarily stable functional and immunogenic sites across the SARS-CoV-2 proteome and greater coronavirus family.,"<h4>Motivation</h4>Since the first recognized case of COVID-19, more than 100 million people have been infected worldwide. Global efforts in drug and vaccine development to fight the disease have yielded vaccines and drug candidates to cure COVID-19. However, the spread of SARS-CoV-2 variants threatens the continued efficacy of these treatments. In order to address this, we interrogate the evolutionary history of the entire SARS-CoV-2 proteome to identify evolutionarily conserved functional sites that can inform the search for treatments with broader coverage across the coronavirus family.<h4>Results</h4>Combining coronavirus family sequence information with the mutations observed in the current COVID-19 outbreak, we systematically and comprehensively define evolutionarily stable sites that may provide useful drug and vaccine targets and which are less likely to be compromised by the emergence of new virus strains. Several experimentally-validated effective drugs interact with these proposed target sites. In addition, the same evolutionary information can prioritize cross reactive antigens that are useful in directing multi-epitope vaccine strategies to illicit broadly neutralizing immune responses to the betacoronavirus family. Although the results are focused on SARS-CoV-2, these approaches stem from evolutionary principles that are agnostic to the organism or infective agent.<h4>Availability</h4>The results of this work are made interactively available at http://cov.lichtargelab.org.<h4>Supplementary information</h4>Supplementary data are available at Bioinformatics online.",0,

Different SV detection methods have been developed; however, each is limited to specific kinds of SVs with varying accuracy and resolution. Previous works have attempted to combine different methods, but they still suffer from poor accuracy particularly for insertions. We propose MetaSV, an integrated SV caller which leverages multiple orthogonal SV signals for high accuracy and resolution. MetaSV proceeds by merging SVs from multiple tools for all types of SVs. It also analyzes soft-clipped reads from alignment to detect insertions accurately since existing tools underestimate insertion SVs. Local assembly in combination with dynamic programming is used to improve breakpoint resolution. Paired-end and coverage information is used to predict SV genotypes. Using simulation and experimental data, we demonstrate the effectiveness of MetaSV across various SV types and sizes.<h4>Availability and implementation</h4>Code in Python is at http://bioinform.github.io/metasv/.<h4>Contact</h4>rd@bina.com<h4>Supplementary information</h4>Supplementary data are available at Bioinformatics online.",0,

Currently, there are 837, 835 and 821 candidate genes recorded in T-HOD for hypertension, obesity and diabetes, respectively. T-HOD employed the state-of-art text-mining technologies, including a gene/disease identification system and a disease-gene relation extraction system, which can be used to affirm the association of genes with three diseases and provide more evidence for further studies.

Whether sex differences exist in the response to ITT stress is unknown. Thus, investigations into the analysis of transcripts during activation of the HPA axis in response to hypoglycemia have revealed the underlying influences of sex in signaling pathways that stimulate the HPA axis. We assessed four time points of ITT application in Balb/c mice. After insulin injection, expression levels of 192 microRNAs and 41 mRNAs associated with the HPA, GH†and hypothalamic-pituitary-gonadal (HPG) axes were determined by real-time RT-PCR in the hypothalamus, pituitary and adrenal tissues, as well as blood samples (Raw data accession: https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/10qI00NAtjxOepcNKxSJnQbJeBFa6zgHK?usp=sharing ). Although the ITT is commonly used as a gold standard for evaluating the HPA axis, we found completely different responses between males and females with respect to activation of the HPA axis. While activation of several transcripts in the hypothalamus and pituitary was observed after performing the ITT in males within 10†min, females responded via the pituitary and adrenal immediately and durably over 40†min. Additionally, we found that microRNA alterations precede mRNA responses in the HPA axis. Furthermore, robust changes in the levels of several transcripts including Avpr1b and Avpr2 observed at all time points strongly suggest that transcriptional control of these genes occurs mostly via differential signaling in pituitary and blood between males and females. Male and female HPA axis responses to ITT involve a number of sophisticated regulatory signaling pathways of miRNAs and mRNAs. Our results highlight the first robust markers in several layers of HPA, HPG and GH axis involved in ITT/hypoglycemia stress-induced dynamics.",0,
22705213,How predictable is the position of third molars over time?,"<h4>Purpose</h4>The purpose of this study was to review contemporaneous longitudinal studies focused on changes in the position of third molars.<h4>Materials and methods</h4>A systematic search of the National Library of Medicine (PubMed, http://www.pubmed.gov) and the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (http://www.mrw.interscience.wiley.com/cochrane) was conducted to identify eligible articles. The inclusion criteria were 1) longitudinal assessment (retrospective or prospective); 2) published in English; and 3) full text available online or at the University of North Carolina Health Sciences Library.<h4>Results</h4>Five studies met the inclusion criteria. The status of third molars with respect to eruption/angulation was operationalized in multiple ways, making any comparison of the frequency of changes in position difficult. The major findings of each study are reviewed.<h4>Conclusions</h4>Few longitudinal data exist on the changes over time of impacted third molars. Impacted teeth that remain static, with no changes in position or angulation over time, are rare.",0,
26072515,Inferring orthologous gene regulatory networks using interspecies data fusion.,"<h4>Motivation</h4>The ability to jointly learn gene regulatory networks (GRNs) in, or leverage GRNs between related species would allow the vast amount of legacy data obtained in model organisms to inform the GRNs of more complex, or economically or medically relevant counterparts. Examples include transferring information from Arabidopsis thaliana into related crop species for food security purposes, or from mice into humans for medical applications. Here we develop two related Bayesian approaches to network inference that allow GRNs to be jointly inferred in, or leveraged between, several related species: in one framework, network information is directly propagated between species; in the second hierarchical approach, network information is propagated via an unobserved 'hypernetwork'. In both frameworks, information about network similarity is captured via graph kernels, with the networks additionally informed by species-specific time series gene expression data, when available, using Gaussian processes to model the dynamics of gene expression.<h4>Results</h4>Results on in silico benchmarks demonstrate that joint inference, and leveraging of known networks between species, offers better accuracy than standalone inference. The direct propagation of network information via the non-hierarchical framework is more appropriate when there are relatively few species, while the hierarchical approach is better suited when there are many species. Both methods are robust to small amounts of mislabelling of orthologues. Finally, the use of Saccharomyces cerevisiae data and networks to inform inference of networks in the budding yeast Schizosaccharomyces pombe predicts a novel role in cell cycle regulation for Gas1 (SPAC19B12.02c), a 1,3-beta-glucanosyltransferase.<h4>Availability and implementation</h4>MATLAB code is available from http://go.warwick.ac.uk/systemsbiology/software/.",0,
32139710,"Classification models for Invasive Ductal Carcinoma Progression, based on gene expression data-trained supervised machine learning.","Early detection of breast cancer and its correct stage determination are important for prognosis and rendering appropriate personalized clinical treatment to breast cancer patients. However, despite considerable efforts and progress, there is a need to identify the specific genomic factors responsible for, or accompanying Invasive Ductal Carcinoma (IDC) progression stages, which can aid the determination of the correct cancer stages. We have developed two-class machine-learning classification models to differentiate the early and late stages of IDC. The prediction models are trained with RNA-seq gene expression profiles representing different IDC stages of 610 patients, obtained from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA). Different supervised learning algorithms were trained and evaluated with an enriched model learning, facilitated by different feature selection methods. We also developed a machine-learning classifier trained on the same datasets with training sets reduced data corresponding to IDC driver genes. Based on these two classifiers, we have developed a web-server Duct-BRCA-CSP to predict early stage from late stages of IDC based on input RNA-seq gene expression profiles. The analysis conducted by us also enables deeper insights into the stage-dependent molecular events accompanying IDC progression. The server is publicly available at http://bioinfo.icgeb.res.in/duct-BRCA-CSP.",0,

28579402,MIDAS: Mining differentially activated subpaths of KEGG pathways from multi-class RNA-seq data.,"Pathway based analysis of high throughput transcriptome data is a widely used approach to investigate biological mechanisms. Since a pathway consists of multiple functions, the recent approach is to determine condition specific sub-pathways or subpaths. However, there are several challenges. First, few existing methods utilize explicit gene expression information from RNA-seq. More importantly, subpath activity is usually an average of statistical scores, e.g., correlations, of edges in a candidate subpath, which fails to reflect gene expression quantity information. In addition, none of existing methods can handle multiple phenotypes. To address these technical problems, we designed and implemented an algorithm, MIDAS, that determines condition specific subpaths, each of which has different activities across multiple phenotypes. MIDAS utilizes gene expression quantity information fully and the network centrality information to determine condition specific subpaths. To test performance of our tool, we used TCGA breast cancer RNA-seq gene expression profiles with five molecular subtypes. 36 differentially activate subpaths were determined. The utility of our method, MIDAS, was demonstrated in four ways. All 36 subpaths are well supported by the literature information. Subsequently, we showed that these subpaths had a good discriminant power for five cancer subtype classification and also had a prognostic power in terms of survival analysis. Finally, in a performance comparison of MIDAS to a recent subpath prediction method, PATHOME, our method identified more subpaths and much more genes that are well supported by the literature information.<h4>Availability</h4>http://biohealth.snu.ac.kr/software/MIDAS/.",0,
31833063,Influence of mental stress and environmental toxins on circadian clocks: Implications for redox regulation of the heart and cardioprotection.,"Risk factors in the environment such as air pollution and mental stress contribute to the development of chronic non-communicable disease. Air pollution was identified as the leading health risk factor in the physical environment, followed by water pollution, soil pollution/heavy metals/chemicals and occupational exposures, however neglecting the non-chemical environmental health risk factors (e.g. mental stress and noise). Epidemiological data suggest that environmental risk factors are associated with higher risk for cardiovascular, metabolic and mental diseases, including hypertension, heart failure, myocardial infarction, diabetes, arrhythmia, stroke, depression and anxiety disorders. We provide an overview on the impact of the external exposome comprising risk factors/exposures on cardiovascular health with a focus on dysregulation of stress hormones, mitochondrial function, redox balance and inflammation with special emphasis on the circadian clock. Finally, we assess the impact of circadian clock dysregulation on cardiovascular health and the potential of environment-specific preventive strategies or ""chrono"" therapy for cardioprotection.

24737859,"The influence of dynein processivity control, MAPs, and microtubule ends on directional movement of a localising mRNA.","Many cellular constituents travel along microtubules in association with multiple copies of motor proteins. How the activity of these motors is regulated during cargo sorting is poorly understood. In this study, we address this issue using a novel in vitro assay for the motility of localising Drosophila mRNAs bound to native dynein-dynactin complexes. High precision tracking reveals that individual RNPs within a population undergo either diffusive, or highly processive, minus end-directed movements along microtubules. RNA localisation signals stimulate the processive movements, with regulation of dynein-dynactin's activity rather than its total copy number per RNP, responsible for this effect. Our data support a novel mechanism for multi-motor translocation based on the regulation of dynein processivity by discrete cargo-associated features. Studying the in vitro responses of RNPs to microtubule-associated proteins (MAPs) and microtubule ends provides insights into how an RNA population could navigate the cytoskeletal network and become anchored at its destination in cells.

In addition, guideline papers and statements of the European Society for Paediatric Urology (ESPU), the European Association of Urology (EAU), the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) and the International Children Continence Society (ICCS) were used to update the knowledge and evidence resulting in this practical recommendation strategy. Recommendations have been discussed and agreed within the working group of the EAU-ESPU guidelines committee members.<h4>Results</h4>The recommendations focus to place the child and his family in a control position. Pragmatic analysis is made of the bedwetting problem by collecting voiding and drinking habits during the day, measuring nighttime urine production and identification of possible risk factors such as high-volume evening drinking, nighttime overactive bladder, behavioral or psychological problems or sleep disordered breathing. A questionnaire will help to identify those risk factors.<h4>Conclusion</h4>Motivation of the child is important for success.

30867992,Lightweight data management with dtool.,"The explosion in volumes and types of data has led to substantial challenges in data management. These challenges are often faced by front-line researchers who are already dealing with rapidly changing technologies and have limited time to devote to data management. There are good high-level guidelines for managing and processing scientific data. However, there is a lack of simple, practical tools to implement these guidelines. This is particularly problematic in a highly distributed research environment where needs differ substantially from group to group and centralised solutions are difficult to implement and storage technologies change rapidly. To meet these challenges we have developed dtool, a command line tool for managing data. The tool packages data and metadata into a unified whole, which we call a dataset. The dataset provides consistency checking and the ability to access metadata for both the whole dataset and individual files. The tool can store these datasets on several different storage systems, including a traditional file system, object store (S3 and Azure) and iRODS. It includes an application programming interface that can be used to incorporate it into existing pipelines and workflows. The tool has provided substantial process, cost, and peace-of-mind benefits to our data management practices and we want to share these benefits.

23028969,Transcriptome tomography for brain analysis in the web-accessible anatomical space.,"Increased information on the encoded mammalian genome is expected to facilitate an integrated understanding of complex anatomical structure and function based on the knowledge of gene products. Determination of gene expression-anatomy associations is crucial for this understanding. To elicit the association in the three-dimensional (3D) space, we introduce a novel technique for comprehensive mapping of endogenous gene expression into a web-accessible standard space: Transcriptome Tomography. The technique is based on conjugation of sequential tissue-block sectioning, all fractions of which are used for molecular measurements of gene expression densities, and the block- face imaging, which are used for 3D reconstruction of the fractions. To generate a 3D map, tissues are serially sectioned in each of three orthogonal planes and the expression density data are mapped using a tomographic technique. This rapid and unbiased mapping technique using a relatively small number of original data points allows researchers to create their own expression maps in the broad anatomical context of the space. In the first instance we generated a dataset of 36,000 maps, reconstructed from data of 61 fractions measured with microarray, covering the whole mouse brain (ViBrism: http://vibrism.riken.jp/3dviewer/ex/index.html) in one month. After computational estimation of the mapping accuracy we validated the dataset against existing data with respect to the expression location and density. To demonstrate the relevance of the framework, we showed disease related expression of Huntington's disease gene and Bdnf. Our tomographic approach is applicable to analysis of any biological molecules derived from frozen tissues, organs and whole embryos, and the maps are spatially isotropic and well suited to the analysis in the standard space (e.g. Waxholm Space for brain-atlas databases). This will facilitate research creating and using open-standards for a molecular-based understanding of complex structures; and will contribute to new insights into a broad range of biological and medical questions.",0,

22780965,ngLOC: software and web server for predicting protein subcellular localization in prokaryotes and eukaryotes.,"<h4>Background</h4>Understanding protein subcellular localization is a necessary component toward understanding the overall function of a protein. Numerous computational methods have been published over the past decade, with varying degrees of success. Despite the large number of published methods in this area, only a small fraction of them are available for researchers to use in their own studies. Of those that are available, many are limited by predicting only a small number of organelles in the cell. Additionally, the majority of methods predict only a single location for a sequence, even though it is known that a large fraction of the proteins in eukaryotic species shuttle between locations to carry out their function.<h4>Findings</h4>We present a software package and a web server for predicting the subcellular localization of protein sequences based on the ngLOC method. ngLOC is an n-gram-based Bayesian classifier that predicts subcellular localization of proteins both in prokaryotes and eukaryotes. The overall prediction accuracy varies from 89.8% to 91.4% across species. This program can predict 11 distinct locations each in plant and animal species. ngLOC also predicts 4 and 5 distinct locations on gram-positive and gram-negative bacterial datasets, respectively.<h4>Conclusions</h4>ngLOC is a generic method that can be trained by data from a variety of species or classes for predicting protein subcellular localization.

It is the hope that this Guideline becomes a reference on the effective evidence-based surgical management of LUTS/BPH. MATERIALS AND METHODS:The evidence team searched Ovid MEDLINE, the Cochrane Library, and the Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality (AHRQ) database to identify studies indexed between January 2007 and September 2017. When sufficient evidence existed, the body of evidence was assigned a strength rating of A (high), B (moderate), or C (low) for support of Strong, Moderate, or Conditional Recommendations. In the absence of sufficient evidence, additional information is provided as Clinical Principles and Expert Opinions (table 1 in supplementary unabridged guideline, http://jurology.com/). RESULTS:This Guideline provides updated, evidence-based recommendations regarding management of LUTS/BPH utilizing surgery and minimally invasive surgical therapies; additional statements are made regarding diagnostic and pre-operative tests. Clinical statements are made in comparison to what is generally accepted as the gold standard (i.e. transurethral resection of the prostate [TURP]-monopolar and/or bipolar). This guideline is designed to be used in conjunction with the associated treatment algorithm. CONCLUSIONS:The prevalence and the severity of LUTS increases as men age and is an important diagnosis in the healthcare of patients and the welfare of society.

21791534,A dynamic programming algorithm for identification of triplex-forming sequences.,"<h4>Motivation</h4>Current methods for identification of potential triplex-forming sequences in genomes and similar sequence sets rely primarily on detecting homopurine and homopyrimidine tracts. Procedures capable of detecting sequences supporting imperfect, but structurally feasible intramolecular triplex structures are needed for better sequence analysis.<h4>Results</h4>We modified an algorithm for detection of approximate palindromes, so as to account for the special nature of triplex DNA structures. From available literature, we conclude that approximate triplexes tolerate two classes of errors. One, analogical to mismatches in duplex DNA, involves nucleotides in triplets that do not readily form Hoogsteen bonds. The other class involves geometrically incompatible neighboring triplets hindering proper alignment of strands for optimal hydrogen bonding and stacking. We tested the statistical properties of the algorithm, as well as its correctness when confronted with known triplex sequences. The proposed algorithm satisfactorily detects sequences with intramolecular triplex-forming potential. Its complexity is directly comparable to palindrome searching.<h4>Availability</h4>Our implementation of the algorithm is available at http://www.fi.muni.cz/lexa/triplex as source code and a web-based search tool.

PMC8054692,"A Spatial Web Application to Explore the Interactions between Human Mobility, Government Policies, and COVID-19 Cases","Reports of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) cases began in December 2019. Soon after, the virus had spread around the world and became a pandemic. Social restrictions, quarantines, and other governmental policies in response to the pandemic altered normal operations across the world. One area significantly affected is human mobility. Typical movement patterns have been hindered by the pandemic. But inversely, mobility patterns can influence patterns of the virus. With this in mind, we created an interactive web application to visualize in near-real time the relationship between the COVID-19 pandemic and human mobility, as well as the impact of governmental policies at different spatial scales. The web application allows users to select a country at the global scale or a state or county for the USA and then displays a corresponding plot that compares human mobility to COVID-19 cases across time for the location, as well as to policy data. The application is useful for quickly revealing insightful patterns. First, the initial impact of the COVID-19 pandemic was a rather sudden decrease in mobility. Second, a relationship exists between mobility and COVID-19 offset by a lag, but that lag is not consistent over space or time. Third, spatial autocorrelation of relationship is apparent, meaning locations near each other share similar patterns. Overall, the application is a useful data visualization tool that helps uncover patterns that might otherwise go unnoticed. The application is available at this link: https://chrischapin7.shinyapps.io/covid19_vs_humanmobility/",0,
21779367,High-resolution quantification of focal adhesion spatiotemporal dynamics in living cells.,"Focal adhesions (FAs) are macromolecular complexes that provide a linkage between the cell and its external environment. In a motile cell, focal adhesions change size and position to govern cell migration, through the dynamic processes of assembly and disassembly. To better understand the dynamic regulation of focal adhesions, we have developed an analysis system for the automated detection, tracking, and data extraction of these structures in living cells. This analysis system was used to quantify the dynamics of fluorescently tagged Paxillin and FAK in NIH 3T3 fibroblasts followed via Total Internal Reflection Fluorescence Microscopy (TIRF). High content time series included the size, shape, intensity, and position of every adhesion present in a living cell. These properties were followed over time, revealing adhesion lifetime and turnover rates, and segregation of properties into distinct zones. As a proof-of-concept, we show how a single point mutation in Paxillin at the Jun-kinase phosphorylation site Serine 178 changes FA size, distribution, and rate of assembly. This study provides a detailed, quantitative picture of FA spatiotemporal dynamics as well as a set of tools and methodologies for advancing our understanding of how focal adhesions are dynamically regulated in living cells.

The prevalence of hypertension in Bangladesh has been increasing. However, there are very limited studies that have evaluated the impact of health education and awareness development in mitigating the burden of hypertension and its complications in Bangladesh. OBJECTIVE:This study aims to increase awareness, enhance knowledge, and change lifestyle behaviors through health education and the use of mobile health (mHealth) technology among individuals with hypertension living in a rural community of Bangladesh. METHODS:A randomized controlled trial is underway in a Mirzapur subdistrict of Bangladesh. This trial compares two groups of individuals with hypertension: The comparison arm receives health education and the intervention arm receives health education and a periodic mobile phone-based text message intervention. The trial duration is 5 months. The primary end point is participants' actual behavior changes brought about by increased awareness and knowledge. RESULTS:Enrollment of participants started in August 2018, and collection of follow-up data was completed at the end of July 2019. A total of 420 participants volunteered to participate, and among them, 209 and 211 were randomly allocated to the intervention group and the control group, respectively. Among them, the ratio of males/females was 12.0/88.0 in the intervention group and 16.1/83.9 in the control group. Data cleaning and analyses have been completed and the results have been submitted for publication.

21464845,An ANN model for the identification of deleterious nsSNPs in tumor suppressor genes.,"<h4>Unlabelled</h4>Human genetic variations primarily result from single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) that occurs approximately every 1000 bases in the overall human population. The non-synonymous SNPs (nsSNPs), lead to amino acid changes in the protein product may account for nearly half of the known genetic variations linked to inherited human diseases and cancer. One of the main problems of medical genetics today is to identify nsSNPs that underlie disease-related phenotypes in humans. An attempt was made to develop a new approach to predict such nsSNPs. This would enhance our understanding of genetic diseases and helps to predict the disease. We detect nsSNPs and all possible and reliable alleles by ANN, a soft computing model using potential SNP information. Reliable nsSNPs are identified, based on the reconstructed alleles and on sequence redundancy. The model gives good results with mean specificity (95.85&), sensitivity (97.40&) and accuracy (96.25&). Our results indicate that ANNs can serve as a useful method to analyze quantitative effect of nsSNPs on protein function and would be useful for large-scale analysis of genomic nsSNP data.<h4>Availability</h4>The database is available for free at http://www.snp.mirworks.in.",1,
30760842,Development and validation of whole genome-wide and genic microsatellite markers in oil palm (Elaeis guineensis Jacq.): First microsatellite database (OpSatdb).,"The availability of large expressed sequence tag (EST) and whole genome databases of oil palm enabled the development of a data base of microsatellite markers. For this purpose, an EST database consisting of 40,979 EST sequences spanning 27 Mb and a chromosome-wise whole genome databases were downloaded. A total of 3,950 primer pairs were identified and developed from EST sequences. The tri and tetra nucleotide repeat motifs were most prevalent (each 24.75%) followed by di-nucleotide repeat motifs. Whole genome-wide analysis found a total of 245,654 SSR repeats across the 16 chromosomes of oil palm, of which 38,717 were compound microsatellite repeats. A web application, OpSatdb, the first microsatellite database of oil palm, was developed using the PHP and MySQL database ( https://ssr.icar.gov.in/index.php ). It is a simple and systematic web-based search engine for searching SSRs based on repeat motif type, repeat type, and primer details. High synteny was observed between oil palm and rice genomes. The mapping of ESTs having SSRs by Blast2GO resulted in the identification of 19.2% sequences with gene ontology (GO) annotations. Randomly, a set of ten genic SSRs and five genomic SSRs were used for validation and genetic diversity on 100 genotypes belonging to the world oil palm genetic resources. The grouping pattern was observed to be broadly in accordance with the geographical origin of the genotypes. The identified genic and genome-wide SSRs can be effectively useful for various genomic applications of oil palm, such as genetic diversity, linkage map construction, mapping of QTLs, marker-assisted selection, and comparative population studies.",1,
24849626,The inhibitory microcircuit of the substantia nigra provides feedback gain control of the basal ganglia output.,"Dysfunction of the basal ganglia produces severe deficits in the timing, initiation, and vigor of movement. These diverse impairments suggest a control system gone awry. In engineered systems, feedback is critical for control. By contrast, models of the basal ganglia highlight feedforward circuitry and ignore intrinsic feedback circuits. In this study, we show that feedback via axon collaterals of substantia nigra projection neurons control the gain of the basal ganglia output. Through a combination of physiology, optogenetics, anatomy, and circuit mapping, we elaborate a general circuit mechanism for gain control in a microcircuit lacking interneurons. Our data suggest that diverse tonic firing rates, weak unitary connections and a spatially diffuse collateral circuit with distinct topography and kinetics from feedforward input is sufficient to implement divisive feedback inhibition. The importance of feedback for engineered systems implies that the intranigral microcircuit, despite its absence from canonical models, could be essential to basal ganglia function.

Important applications of those data include estimating the functional similarity between ontology terms and between annotated biomedical entities, analyzing enrichment for a set of biomedical entities. Many semantic similarity calculation and enrichment analysis methods have been proposed for such applications. Also, a number of tools implementing the methods have been developed on different platforms. However, these tools have implemented a small number of the semantic similarity calculation and enrichment analysis methods for a certain type of biomedical ontology. Note that the methods can be applied to all types of biomedical ontologies. More importantly, each method can be dominant in different applications; thus, users have more choice with more number of methods implemented in tools. Also, more functions would facilitate their task with ontology.<h4>Results</h4>In this study, we developed a Cytoscape app, named UFO, which unifies most of the semantic similarity measures for between-term and between-entity similarity calculation for all types of biomedical ontologies in OBO format. Based on the similarity calculation, UFO can calculate the similarity between two sets of entities and weigh imported entity networks as well as generate functional similarity networks. Besides, it can perform enrichment analysis of a set of entities by different methods. Moreover, UFO can visualize structural relationships between ontology terms, annotating relationships between entities and terms, and functional similarity between entities. Finally, we demonstrated the ability of UFO through some case studies on finding the best semantic similarity measures for assessing the similarity between human disease phenotypes, constructing biomedical entity functional similarity networks for predicting disease-associated biomarkers, and performing enrichment analysis on a set of similar phenotypes.<h4>Conclusions</h4>Taken together, UFO is expected to be a tool where biomedical ontologies can be exploited for various biomedical applications.<h4>Availability</h4>UFO is distributed as a Cytoscape app, and can be downloaded freely at Cytoscape App (http://apps.cytoscape.org/apps/ufo) for non-commercial use.",0,
26782957,A randomized clinical trial of neoadjuvant chemotherapy versus neoadjuvant chemoradiotherapy for cancer of the oesophagus or gastro-oesophageal junction.,"<h4>Background</h4>Neoadjuvant therapy improves long-term survival after oesophagectomy, treating oesophageal cancer, but the evidence to date is insufficient to determine which of the two main neoadjuvant therapy types, chemotherapy (nCT) or chemoradiotherapy (nCRT), is more beneficial. We aimed to compare the effects of nCT with those of nCRT.<h4>Patients and methods</h4>This multicentre trial, which was conducted in Sweden and Norway, recruited 181 patients with carcinoma of the oesophagus or the gastro-oesophageal junction who were candidates for curative-intended treatment. The primary end point was histological complete response after neoadjuvant treatment, which has been shown to be correlated with increased long-term survival. Study participants were randomized to nCT or nCRT, followed by surgery with two-field lymphadenectomy. Three cycles of platin/5-fluorouracil were administered in both arms, whereas 40 Gy of concomitant radiotherapy was added in the nCRT arm.<h4>Results</h4>The trial met the primary end point, histological complete response being achieved in 28% after nCRT versus 9% after nCT (P = 0.002). Lymph-node metastases were observed in 62% in the nCT group versus 35% in the nCRT group (P = 0.001). The R0 resection rate was 87% after nCRT and 74% after nCT (P = 0.04). There was no difference in overall survival between the treatment arms.<h4>Conclusion</h4>The addition of radiotherapy to neoadjuvant chemotherapy results in higher histological complete response rate, higher R0 resection rate, and a lower frequency of lymph-node metastases, without significantly affecting survival.<h4>Clinicaltrialsgov</h4>NCT01362127 (https://clinicaltrials.gov; The full study protocol was registered in the Clinical Trials Database).",0,
30299485,Congress of Neurological Surgeons Systematic Review and Evidence-Based Guidelines on the Evaluation and Treatment of Patients With Thoracolumbar Spine Trauma: Novel Surgical Strategies.,"<h4>Background</h4>Treatment of thoracolumbar burst fractures has traditionally involved spinal instrumentation with fusion performed with standard open surgical techniques. Novel surgical strategies, including instrumentation without fusion and percutaneous instrumentation alone, have been considered less invasive and more efficient treatments.<h4>Objective</h4>To review the current literature and determine the role of fusion in instrumented fixation, as well as the role of percutaneous instrumentation, in the treatment of patients with thoracolumbar burst fractures.<h4>Methods</h4>The task force members identified search terms/parameters and a medical librarian implemented the literature search, consistent with the literature search protocol (see Appendix I), using the National Library of Medicine PubMed database and the Cochrane Library for the period from January 1, 1946 to March 31, 2015.<h4>Results</h4>A total of 906 articles were identified and 38 were selected for full-text review. Of these articles, 12 articles met criteria for inclusion in this systematic review.<h4>Conclusion</h4>There is grade A evidence for the omission of fusion in instrumented fixation for thoracolumbar burst fractures. There is grade B evidence that percutaneous instrumentation is as effective as open instrumentation for thoracolumbar burst fractures.<h4>Question</h4>Does the addition of arthrodesis to instrumented fixation improve outcomes in patients with thoracic and lumbar burst fractures?<h4>Recommendation</h4>It is recommended that in the surgical treatment of patients with thoracolumbar burst fractures, surgeons should understand that the addition of arthrodesis to instrumented stabilization has not been shown to impact clinical or radiological outcomes, and adds to increased blood loss and operative time. Strength of Recommendation: Grade A.<h4>Question</h4>How does the use of minimally invasive techniques (including percutaneous instrumentation) affect outcomes in patients undergoing surgery for thoracic and lumbar fractures compared to conventional open techniques?<h4>Recommendation</h4>Stabilization using both open and percutaneous pedicle screws may be considered in the treatment of thoracolumbar burst fractures as the evidence suggests equivalent clinical outcomes.

23493323,BRANCH: boosting RNA-Seq assemblies with partial or related genomic sequences.,"<h4>Motivation</h4>De novo transcriptome assemblies of RNA-Seq data are important for genomics applications of unsequenced organisms. Owing to the complexity and often incomplete representation of transcripts in sequencing libraries, the assembly of high-quality transcriptomes can be challenging. However, with the rapidly growing number of sequenced genomes, it is now feasible to improve RNA-Seq assemblies by guiding them with genomic sequences.<h4>Results</h4>This study introduces BRANCH, an algorithm designed for improving de novo transcriptome assemblies by using genomic information that can be partial or complete genome sequences from the same or a related organism. Its input includes assembled RNA reads (transfrags), genomic sequences (e.g. contigs) and the RNA reads themselves. It uses a customized version of BLAT to align the transfrags and RNA reads to the genomic sequences. After identifying exons from the alignments, it defines a directed acyclic graph and maps the transfrags to paths on the graph. It then joins and extends the transfrags by applying an algorithm that solves a combinatorial optimization problem, called the Minimum weight Minimum Path Cover with given Paths. In performance tests on real data from Caenorhabditis elegans and Saccharomyces cerevisiae, assisted by genomic contigs from the same species, BRANCH improved the sensitivity and precision of transfrags generated by Velvet/Oases or Trinity by 5.1-56.7% and 0.3-10.5%, respectively. These improvements added 3.8-74.1% complete transcripts and 8.3-3.8% proteins to the initial assembly. Similar improvements were achieved when guiding the BRANCH processing of a transcriptome assembly from a more complex organism (mouse) with genomic sequences from a related species (rat).<h4>Availability</h4>The BRANCH software can be downloaded for free from this site: http://manuals.bioinformatics.ucr.edu/home/branch.<h4>Contact</h4>thomas.girke@ucr.edu<h4>Supplementary information</h4>Supplementary data are available at Bioinformatics online.",0,

26626453,Fast dimension reduction and integrative clustering of multi-omics data using low-rank approximation: application to cancer molecular classification.,"<h4>Background</h4>One major goal of large-scale cancer omics study is to identify molecular subtypes for more accurate cancer diagnoses and treatments. To deal with high-dimensional cancer multi-omics data, a promising strategy is to find an effective low-dimensional subspace of the original data and then cluster cancer samples in the reduced subspace. However, due to data-type diversity and big data volume, few methods can integrative and efficiently find the principal low-dimensional manifold of the high-dimensional cancer multi-omics data.<h4>Results</h4>In this study, we proposed a novel low-rank approximation based integrative probabilistic model to fast find the shared principal subspace across multiple data types: the convexity of the low-rank regularized likelihood function of the probabilistic model ensures efficient and stable model fitting. Candidate molecular subtypes can be identified by unsupervised clustering hundreds of cancer samples in the reduced low-dimensional subspace. On testing datasets, our method LRAcluster (low-rank approximation based multi-omics data clustering) runs much faster with better clustering performances than the existing method. Then, we applied LRAcluster on large-scale cancer multi-omics data from TCGA. The pan-cancer analysis results show that the cancers of different tissue origins are generally grouped as independent clusters, except squamous-like carcinomas. While the single cancer type analysis suggests that the omics data have different subtyping abilities for different cancer types.<h4>Conclusions</h4>LRAcluster is a very useful method for fast dimension reduction and unsupervised clustering of large-scale multi-omics data. LRAcluster is implemented in R and freely available via http://bioinfo.au.tsinghua.edu.cn/software/lracluster/ .",0,

29224730,A validated calculator to estimate risk of cesarean after an induction of labor with an unfavorable cervix.,"<h4>Background</h4>Induction of labor occurs in >20% of pregnancies, which equates to approximately 1 million women undergoing an induction in the United States annually. Regardless of how common inductions are, our ability to predict induction success is limited. Although multiple risk factors for a failed induction have been identified, risk factors alone are not enough to quantify an actual risk of cesarean for an individual woman undergoing a cesarean.<h4>Objective</h4>The objective of this study was to derive and validate a prediction model for cesarean after induction with an unfavorable cervix and to create a Web-based calculator to assist in patient counseling.<h4>Study design</h4>Derivation and validation of a prediction model for cesarean delivery after induction was performed as part of a planned secondary analysis of a large randomized trial. A predictive model for cesarean delivery was derived using multivariable logistic regression from a large randomized trial on induction methods (n†= 491) that took place from 2013 through 2015 at an academic institution. Full-term (=37 weeks) women carrying a singleton gestation with intact membranes and an unfavorable cervix (Bishop score =6 and dilation =2 cm) undergoing an induction were included in this trial. Both nulliparous and multiparous women were included. Women with a prior cesarean were excluded. Refinement of the prediction model was performed using an observational cohort of women from the same institution who underwent an induction (n†= 364) during the trial period. An external validation was performed utilizing a publicly available database (Consortium for Safe Labor) that includes information for >200,000 deliveries from 19 hospitals across the United States from 2002 through 2008. After applying the same inclusion and exclusion criteria utilized in the derivation cohort, a total of 8466 women remained for analysis. The discriminative power of each model was assessed using a bootstrap, bias-corrected area under the curve.<h4>Results</h4>The cesarean delivery rates in the derivation and external validation groups were: 27.7% (n†= 136/491) and 26.4% (n†= 2235/8466). In multivariable modeling, nulliparity, gestation age =40 weeks, body mass index at delivery, modified Bishop score, and height were significantly associated with cesarean. A nomogram and calculator were created and found to have an area under the curve in the external validation cohort of 0.73 (95% confidence interval, 0.72-0.74).<h4>Conclusion</h4>A nomogram and user-friendly Web-based calculator that incorporates 5 variables known at the start of induction has been developed and validated. It can be found at: http://www.uphs.upenn.edu/obgyn/labor-induction-calculator/. This calculator can be used to augment patient counseling for women undergoing an induction with an unfavorable cervix.",0,
33620450,VoroCNN: Deep convolutional neural network built on 3D Voronoi tessellation of protein structures.,"<h4>Motivation</h4>Effective use of evolutionary information has recently led to tremendous progress in computational prediction of three-dimensional (3D) structures of proteins and their complexes. Despite the progress, the accuracy of predicted structures tends to vary considerably from case to case. Since the utility of computational models depends on their accuracy, reliable estimates of deviation between predicted and native structures are of utmost importance.<h4>Results</h4>For the first time, we present a deep convolutional neural network (CNN) constructed on a Voronoi tessellation of 3D molecular structures. Despite the irregular data domain, our data representation allows us to efficiently introduce both convolution and pooling operations and train the network in an end-to-end fashion without precomputed descriptors. The resultant model, VoroCNN, predicts local qualities of 3D protein folds. The prediction results are competitive to state of the art and superior to the previous 3D CNN architectures built for the same task. We also discuss practical applications of VoroCNN, for example, in recognition of protein binding interfaces.<h4>Availability</h4>The model, data, and evaluation tests are available at https://team.inria.fr/nano-d/software/vorocnn/.<h4>Supplementary information</h4>Supplementary data are available at Bioinformatics online.",1,

Only carefully evaluated data were deposited in the graphical database MutationView (http://mutview.dmb.med.keio.ac.jp) to construct KM-parkin-DB, an independent sub-set database. Forty-four articles were selected for data curation regarding clinical information such as ethnic origins, manifested symptoms, onset age, and hereditary patterns as well as mutation details including base changes and zygosity. A total of 366 cases were collected from 39 ethnic origins and 96 pathogenic mutations were found. PARK2 gene mutations were found also in some general Parkinson disease patients. The majority (63%) of mutations in PARK2 were restricted to two particular domains (UBL and RING1) of the Parkin protein. In these domains, two major mutations, a large deletion (DelEx3) and a point mutation (p.Arg275Trp), were located.",1,
27242836,VESPUCCI: Exploring Patterns of Gene Expression in Grapevine.,"Large-scale transcriptional studies aim to decipher the dynamic cellular responses to a stimulus, like different environmental conditions. In the era of high-throughput omics biology, the most used technologies for these purposes are microarray and RNA-Seq, whose data are usually required to be deposited in public repositories upon publication. Such repositories have the enormous potential to provide a comprehensive view of how different experimental conditions lead to expression changes, by comparing gene expression across all possible measured conditions. Unfortunately, this task is greatly impaired by differences among experimental platforms that make direct comparisons difficult. In this paper, we present the Vitis Expression Studies Platform Using COLOMBOS Compendia Instances (VESPUCCI), a gene expression compendium for grapevine which was built by adapting an approach originally developed for bacteria, and show how it can be used to investigate complex gene expression patterns. We integrated nearly all publicly available microarray and RNA-Seq expression data: 1608 gene expression samples from 10 different technological platforms. Each sample has been manually annotated using a controlled vocabulary developed ad hoc to ensure both human readability and computational tractability. Expression data in the compendium can be visually explored using several tools provided by the web interface or can be programmatically accessed using the REST interface.

33725111,Whole genome analysis of more than 10 000 SARS-CoV-2 virus unveils global genetic diversity and target region of NSP6.,"Whole genome analysis of SARS-CoV-2 is important to identify its genetic diversity. Moreover, accurate detection of SARS-CoV-2 is required for its correct diagnosis. To address these, first we have analysed publicly available 10 664 complete or near-complete SARS-CoV-2 genomes of 73 countries globally to find mutation points in the coding regions as substitution, deletion, insertion and single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) globally and country wise. In this regard, multiple sequence alignment is performed in the presence of reference sequence from NCBI. Once the alignment is done, a consensus sequence is build to analyse each genomic sequence to identify the unique mutation points as substitutions, deletions, insertions and SNPs globally, thereby resulting in 7209, 11700, 119 and 53 such mutation points respectively. Second, in such categories, unique mutations for individual countries are determined with respect to other 72 countries. In case of India, unique 385, 867, 1 and 11 substitutions, deletions, insertions and SNPs are present in 566 SARS-CoV-2 genomes while 458, 1343, 8 and 52 mutation points in such categories are common with other countries. In majority (above 10%) of virus population, the most frequent and common mutation points between global excluding India and India are L37F, P323L, F506L, S507G, D614G and Q57H in NSP6, RdRp, Exon, Spike and ORF3a respectively. While for India, the other most frequent mutation points are T1198K, A97V, T315N and P13L in NSP3, RdRp, Spike and ORF8 respectively. These mutations are further visualised in protein structures and phylogenetic analysis has been done to show the diversity in virus genomes. Third, a web application is provided for searching mutation points globally and country wise. Finally, we have identified the potential conserved region as target that belongs to the coding region of ORF1ab, specifically to the NSP6 gene. Subsequently, we have provided the primers and probes using that conserved region so that it can be used for detecting SARS-CoV-2.

31913588,Measuring and optimising the efficiency of community hospital inpatient care for older people: the MoCHA mixed-methods study,"<h4>Background</h4>Community hospitals are small hospitals providing local inpatient and outpatient services. National surveys report that inpatient rehabilitation for older people is a core function but there are large differences in key performance measures. We have investigated these variations in community hospital ward performance.<h4>Objectives</h4>(1) To measure the relative performance of community hospital wards (studies 1 and 2); (2) to identify characteristics of community hospital wards that optimise performance (studies 1 and 3); (3) to develop a web-based interactive toolkit that supports operational changes to optimise ward performance (study 4); (4) to investigate the impact of community hospital wards on secondary care use (study 5); and (5) to investigate associations between short-term community (intermediate care) services and secondary care utilisation (study 5).<h4>Methods</h4>Study 1 ñ we used national data to conduct econometric estimations using stochastic frontier analysis in which a cost function was modelled using significant predictors of community hospital ward costs. Study 2 ñ a national postal survey was developed to collect data from a larger sample of community hospitals. Study 3 ñ three ethnographic case studies were performed to provide insight into less tangible aspects of community hospital ward care. Study 4 ñ a web-based interactive toolkit was developed by integrating the econometrics (study 1) and case study (study 3) findings. Study 5 ñ regression analyses were conducted using data from the Atlas of Variation Map 61 (rate of emergency admissions to hospital for people aged = 75 years with a length of stay of < 24 hours) and the National Audit of Intermediate Care.<h4>Results</h4>Community hospital ward efficiency is comparable with the NHS acute hospital sector (mean cost efficiency 0.83, range 0.72ñ0.92). The rank order of community hospital ward efficiencies was distinguished to facilitate learning across the sector. On average, if all community hospital wards were operating in line with the highest cost efficiency, savings of 17% (or £47M per year) could be achieved (price year 2013/14) for our sample of 101 wards. Significant economies of scale were found: a 1% rise in output was associated with an average 0.85% increase in costs. We were unable to obtain a larger community hospital sample because of the low response rate to our national survey. The case studies identified how rehabilitation was delivered through collaborative, interdisciplinary working; interprofessional communication; and meaningful patient and family engagement. We also developed insight into patientsí recovery trajectories and care transitions. The web-based interactive toolkit was established [http://mocha.nhsbenchmarking.nhs.uk/ (accessed 9 September 2019)]. The crisis response team type of intermediate care, but not community hospitals, had a statistically significant negative association with emergency admissions.<h4>Limitations</h4>The econometric analyses were based on cross-sectional data and were also limited by missing data. The low response rate to our national survey means that we cannot extrapolate reliably from our community hospital sample.<h4>Conclusions</h4>The results suggest that significant community hospital ward savings may be realised by improving modifiable performance factors that might be augmented further by economies of scale.<h4>Future work</h4>How less efficient hospitals might reduce costs and sustain quality requires further research.<h4>Funding</h4>This project was funded by the National Institute for Health Research (NIHR) Health Services and Delivery Research programme and will be published in full in Health Services and Delivery Research; Vol. 8, No. 1.

27102804,Using expected sequence features to improve basecalling accuracy of amplicon pyrosequencing data.,"<h4>Background</h4>Amplicon pyrosequencing targets a known genetic region and thus inherently produces reads highly anticipated to have certain features, such as conserved nucleotide sequence, and in the case of protein coding DNA, an open reading frame. Pyrosequencing errors, consisting mainly of nucleotide insertions and deletions, are on the other hand likely to disrupt open reading frames. Such an inverse relationship between errors and expectation based on prior knowledge can be used advantageously to guide the process known as basecalling, i.e. the inference of nucleotide sequence from raw sequencing data.<h4>Results</h4>The new basecalling method described here, named Multipass, implements a probabilistic framework for working with the raw flowgrams obtained by pyrosequencing. For each sequence variant Multipass calculates the likelihood and nucleotide sequence of several most likely sequences given the flowgram data. This probabilistic approach enables integration of basecalling into a larger model where other parameters can be incorporated, such as the likelihood for observing a full-length open reading frame at the targeted region. We apply the method to 454 amplicon pyrosequencing data obtained from a malaria virulence gene family, where Multipass generates 20 % more error-free sequences than current state of the art methods, and provides sequence characteristics that allow generation of a set of high confidence error-free sequences.<h4>Conclusions</h4>This novel method can be used to increase accuracy of existing and future amplicon sequencing data, particularly where extensive prior knowledge is available about the obtained sequences, for example in analysis of the immunoglobulin VDJ region where Multipass can be combined with a model for the known recombining germline genes. Multipass is available for Roche 454 data at http://www.cbs.dtu.dk/services/MultiPass-1.0 , and the concept can potentially be implemented for other sequencing technologies as well.",0,
26318525,[MEG]PLS: A pipeline for MEG data analysis and partial least squares statistics.,"The emphasis of modern neurobiological theories has recently shifted from the independent function of brain areas to their interactions in the context of whole-brain networks. As a result, neuroimaging methods and analyses have also increasingly focused on network discovery. Magnetoencephalography (MEG) is a neuroimaging modality that captures neural activity with a high degree of temporal specificity, providing detailed, time varying maps of neural activity. Partial least squares (PLS) analysis is a multivariate framework that can be used to isolate distributed spatiotemporal patterns of neural activity that differentiate groups or cognitive tasks, to relate neural activity to behavior, and to capture large-scale network interactions. Here we introduce [MEG]PLS, a MATLAB-based platform that streamlines MEG data preprocessing, source reconstruction and PLS analysis in a single unified framework. [MEG]PLS facilitates MRI preprocessing, including segmentation and coregistration, MEG preprocessing, including filtering, epoching, and artifact correction, MEG sensor analysis, in both time and frequency domains, MEG source analysis, including multiple head models and beamforming algorithms, and combines these with a suite of PLS analyses. The pipeline is open-source and modular, utilizing functions from FieldTrip (Donders, NL), AFNI (NIMH, USA), SPM8 (UCL, UK) and PLScmd (Baycrest, CAN), which are extensively supported and continually developed by their respective communities. [MEG]PLS is flexible, providing both a graphical user interface and command-line options, depending on the needs of the user. A visualization suite allows multiple types of data and analyses to be displayed and includes 4-D montage functionality.

We used a geographic information system analysis to estimate the annual average satellite-derived PM2.5 concentration for the geocoded location of the participants' baseline residences. Poor cognitive function was defined as a score of less than 18 on the Chinese version of the Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE). Competing risk models were performed to explore the association of PM2.5 with poor cognitive function.<h4>Results</h4>Each 10-µg/m3 increase in PM2.5 was associated with a 5.1% increased risk of poor cognitive function [adjusted hazard ratio (HR): 1.051; 95% confidence interval (CI): 1.023, 1.079]. Compared to the lowest quartile of PM2.5 (<41.4 µg/m3), adjusted HR values were 1.20 (95% CI: 1.09, 1.33), 1.27 (95% CI: 1.15, 1.41), and 1.21 (95% CI: 1.09, 1.34) for the second (=41.4-50.3 ug/m3), third (=50.3-60.7µg/m3), and fourth (=60.7 µg/m3) quartiles of PM2.5, respectively (<i>p</i> for trend <0.001). Subgroup analyses suggested stronger associations between PM2.5 and poor cognitive impairment in men than women. The association was positive in the 65- to 79- and =100-y age group but not significant and positive in the other two age groups with similar results.<h4>Conclusion</h4>PM2.5 was identified as a risk factor for poor cognitive function in Chinese older adults. Improving air quality may reduce the future population burden of poor cognitive function, especially in areas with high air pollution. https://doi.org/10.1289/EHP5304.",0,
30150996,AromaDb: A Database of Medicinal and Aromatic Plant's Aroma Molecules With Phytochemistry and Therapeutic Potentials.,"In traditional, herbal medicine, and aromatherapy, use of essential oils and their aroma compounds have been known since long, for the management of various human diseases. The essential oil is a mixture of highly complex, naturally occurring volatile aroma compounds synthesized by medicinal and aromatic plants as secondary metabolites. Essential oils widely used in pharmaceutical, cosmetic, sanitary, food industry and agriculture for their antibacterial, antiviral, antifungal, antiparasitic, insecticidal, anticancer, neuroprotective, psychophysiological, and anti-aging activities. Moreover, volatile aroma compounds comprise a chemically diverse class of low molecular weight organic compounds with significant vapor pressure. However, aroma compounds produced by plants, mainly attract pollinators, seed dispersers and provide defense against pests or pathogens. However, in humans, about 300 active olfactory receptor genes are involved to detect thousands of different aroma compounds and modulates expression of different metabolic genes regulating human psychophysiological activity, brain function, pharmacological signaling, and therapeutic potential. Keeping in mind this importance, present database, namely, AromaDb (http://bioinfo.cimap.res.in/aromadb/) covers information of plant varieties/chemotypes, essential oils, chemical constituents, GC-MS profile, yield variations due to agro-morphological parameters, trade data, aroma compounds, fragrance type, and bioactivity details.

33391232,Creation of an Online Platform for Identification of Microorganisms: Peak Picking or Full-Spectrum Analysis.,"Identification of microorganisms by MALDI-TOF mass spectrometry is a very efficient method with high throughput, speed, and accuracy. However, it is significantly limited by the absence of a universal database of reference mass spectra. This problem can be solved by creating an Internet platform for open databases of protein spectra of microorganisms. Choosing the optimal mathematical apparatus is the pivotal issue for this task. In our previous study we proposed the geometric approach for processing mass spectrometry data, which represented a mass spectrum as a vector in a multidimensional Euclidean space. This algorithm was implemented in a Jacob4 stand-alone package. We demonstrated its efficiency in delimiting two closely related species of the <i>Bacillus pumilus</i> group. In this study, the geometric approach was realized as R scripts which allowed us to design a Web-based application. We also studied the possibility of using full spectra analysis (FSA) without calculating mass peaks (PPA), which is the logical development of the method. We used 74 microbial strains from the collections of ICiG SB RAS, UNIQEM, IEGM, KMM, and VGM as the models. We demonstrated that the algorithms based on peak-picking and analysis of complete data have accuracy no less than that of Biotyper 3.1 software. We proposed a method for calculating cut-off thresholds based on averaged intraspecific distances. The resulting database, raw data, and the set of R scripts are available online at https://icg-test.mydisk.nsc.ru/s/qj6cfZg57g6qwzN.",1,
33177514,"SAVI, in silico generation of billions of easily synthesizable compounds through expert-system type rules.","We have made available a database of over 1 billion compounds predicted to be easily synthesizable, called Synthetically Accessible Virtual Inventory (SAVI). They have been created by a set of transforms based on an adaptation and extension of the CHMTRN/PATRAN programming languages describing chemical synthesis expert knowledge, which originally stem from the LHASA project. The chemoinformatics toolkit CACTVS was used to apply a total of 53 transforms to about 150,000 readily available building blocks (enamine.net). Only single-step, two-reactant syntheses were calculated for this database even though the technology can execute multi-step reactions. The possibility to incorporate scoring systems in CHMTRN allowed us to subdivide the database of 1.75 billion compounds in sets according to their predicted synthesizability, with the most-synthesizable class comprising 1.09 billion synthetic products. Properties calculated for all SAVI products show that the database should be well-suited for drug discovery. It is being made publicly available for free download from https://doi.org/10.35115/37n9-5738.",1,
21371586,"Preparation of protein samples for NMR structure, function, and small-molecule screening studies.","In this chapter, we concentrate on the production of high-quality protein samples for nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) studies. In particular, we provide an in-depth description of recent advances in the production of NMR samples and their synergistic use with recent advancements in NMR hardware. We describe the protein production platform of the Northeast Structural Genomics Consortium and outline our high-throughput strategies for producing high-quality protein samples for NMR studies. Our strategy is based on the cloning, expression, and purification of 6◊-His-tagged proteins using T7-based Escherichia coli systems and isotope enrichment in minimal media. We describe 96-well ligation-independent cloning and analytical expression systems, parallel preparative scale fermentation, and high-throughput purification protocols. The 6◊-His affinity tag allows for a similar two-step purification procedure implemented in a parallel high-throughput fashion that routinely results in purity levels sufficient for NMR studies (>97% homogeneity). Using this platform, the protein open reading frames of over 17,500 different targeted proteins (or domains) have been cloned as over 28,000 constructs. Nearly 5000 of these proteins have been purified to homogeneity in tens of milligram quantities (see Summary Statistics, http://nesg.org/statistics.html), resulting in more than 950 new protein structures, including more than 400 NMR structures, deposited in the Protein Data Bank. The Northeast Structural Genomics Consortium pipeline has been effective in producing protein samples of both prokaryotic and eukaryotic origin. Although this chapter describes our entire pipeline for producing isotope-enriched protein samples, it focuses on the major updates introduced during the last 5 years (Phase 2 of the National Institute of General Medical Sciences Protein Structure Initiative). Our advanced automated and/or parallel cloning, expression, purification, and biophysical screening technologies are suitable for implementation in a large individual laboratory or by a small group of collaborating investigators for structural biology, functional proteomics, ligand screening, and structural genomics research.",0,

23737449,antiSMASH 2.0--a versatile platform for genome mining of secondary metabolite producers.,"Microbial secondary metabolites are a potent source of antibiotics and other pharmaceuticals. Genome mining of their biosynthetic gene clusters has become a key method to accelerate their identification and characterization. In 2011, we developed antiSMASH, a web-based analysis platform that automates this process. Here, we present the highly improved antiSMASH 2.0 release, available at http://antismash.secondarymetabolites.org/. For the new version, antiSMASH was entirely re-designed using a plug-and-play concept that allows easy integration of novel predictor or output modules. antiSMASH 2.0 now supports input of multiple related sequences simultaneously (multi-FASTA/GenBank/EMBL), which allows the analysis of draft genomes comprising multiple contigs. Moreover, direct analysis of protein sequences is now possible. antiSMASH 2.0 has also been equipped with the capacity to detect additional classes of secondary metabolites, including oligosaccharide antibiotics, phenazines, thiopeptides, homo-serine lactones, phosphonates and furans. The algorithm for predicting the core structure of the cluster end product is now also covering lantipeptides, in addition to polyketides and non-ribosomal peptides. The antiSMASH ClusterBlast functionality has been extended to identify sub-clusters involved in the biosynthesis of specific chemical building blocks.

32997632,Interhemispheric Functional Reorganization and its Structural Base After BCI-Guided Upper-Limb Training in Chronic Stroke.,"Brain-computer interface (BCI)-guided robot-assisted upper-limb training has been increasingly applied to stroke rehabilitation. However, the induced long-term neuroplasticity modulation still needs to be further characterized. This study investigated the functional reorganization and its structural base after BCI-guided robot-assisted training using resting-state fMRI, task-based fMRI, and diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) data. The clinical improvement and the neurological changes before, immediately after, and six months after 20-session BCI-guided robot hand training were explored in 14 chronic stroke subjects. The structural base of the induced functional reorganization and motor improvement were also investigated using DTI. Repeated measure ANOVA indicated long-term motor improvement was found (F[2, 26] = 6.367, p = 0.006). Significantly modulated functional connectivity (FC) was observed between ipsilesional motor regions (M1 and SMA) and some contralesional areas (SMA, PMd, SPL) in the seed-based analysis. Modulated FC with ipsilesional M1 was significantly correlated with motor function improvement (r = 0.6455, p = 0.0276). Besides, increased interhemispheric FC among the sensorimotor area from resting-state data and increased laterality index from task-based data together indicated the re-balance of the two hemispheres during the recovery. Multiple linear regression models suggested that both motor function improvement and the functional change between ipsilesional M1 and contralesional premotor area were significantly associated with the ipsilesional corticospinal tract integrity. The results in the current study provided solid support for stroke recovery mechanism in terms of interhemispheric interaction and its structural substrates, which could further enhance the understanding of BCI training in stroke rehabilitation. This study was registered at https://clinicaltrials.gov (NCT02323061).",0,

26387108,The Protein Ensemble Database.,"The scientific community's major conceptual notion of structural biology has recently shifted in emphasis from the classical structure-function paradigm due to the emergence of intrinsically disordered proteins (IDPs). As opposed to their folded cousins, these proteins are defined by the lack of a stable 3D fold and a high degree of inherent structural heterogeneity that is closely tied to their function. Due to their flexible nature, solution techniques such as small-angle X-ray scattering (SAXS), nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy and fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET) are particularly well-suited for characterizing their biophysical properties. Computationally derived structural ensembles based on such experimental measurements provide models of the conformational sampling displayed by these proteins, and they may offer valuable insights into the functional consequences of inherent flexibility. The Protein Ensemble Database (http://pedb.vib.be) is the first openly accessible, manually curated online resource storing the ensemble models, protocols used during the calculation procedure, and underlying primary experimental data derived from SAXS and/or NMR measurements. By making this previously inaccessible data freely available to researchers, this novel resource is expected to promote the development of more advanced modelling methodologies, facilitate the design of standardized calculation protocols, and consequently lead to a better understanding of how function arises from the disordered state.",1,

However, in data sets composed of individuals from diverse ancestries, HWE can be violated even without genotyping error, complicating the use of HWE testing to assess genotype data quality. In this manuscript, we present the Robust Unified Test for HWE (RUTH) to test for HWE while accounting for population structure and genotype uncertainty, and to evaluate the impact of population heterogeneity and genotype uncertainty on the standard HWE tests and alternative methods using simulated and real sequence data sets. Our results demonstrate that ignoring population structure or genotype uncertainty in HWE tests can inflate false-positive rates by many orders of magnitude. Our evaluations demonstrate different tradeoffs between false positives and statistical power across the methods, with RUTH consistently among the best across all evaluations. RUTH is implemented as a practical and scalable software tool to rapidly perform HWE tests across millions of markers and hundreds of thousands of individuals while supporting standard VCF/BCF formats.

24885229,A comprehensive assessment of the transcriptome of cork oak (Quercus suber) through EST sequencing.,"<h4>Background</h4>Cork oak (Quercus suber) is one of the rare trees with the ability to produce cork, a material widely used to make wine bottle stoppers, flooring and insulation materials, among many other uses. The molecular mechanisms of cork formation are still poorly understood, in great part due to the difficulty in studying a species with a long life-cycle and for which there is scarce molecular/genomic information. Cork oak forests are of great ecological importance and represent a major economic and social resource in Southern Europe and Northern Africa. However, global warming is threatening the cork oak forests by imposing thermal, hydric and many types of novel biotic stresses. Despite the economic and social value of the Q. suber species, few genomic resources have been developed, useful for biotechnological applications and improved forest management.<h4>Results</h4>We generated in excess of 7 million sequence reads, by pyrosequencing 21 normalized cDNA libraries derived from multiple Q. suber tissues and organs, developmental stages and physiological conditions. We deployed a stringent sequence processing and assembly pipeline that resulted in the identification of ~159,000 unigenes. These were annotated according to their similarity to known plant genes, to known Interpro domains, GO classes and E.C. numbers. The phylogenetic extent of this ESTs set was investigated, and we found that cork oak revealed a significant new gene space that is not covered by other model species or EST sequencing projects. The raw data, as well as the full annotated assembly, are now available to the community in a dedicated web portal at http://www.corkoakdb.org.<h4>Conclusions</h4>This genomic resource represents the first trancriptome study in a cork producing species. It can be explored to develop new tools and approaches to understand stress responses and developmental processes in forest trees, as well as the molecular cascades underlying cork differentiation and disease response.",1,

A recent benchmark of binding affinities has allowed, for the first time, the evaluation and construction of binding free energy models using a diverse set of complexes, and a systematic assessment of our ability to model the energetics of conformational changes.<h4>Results</h4>We construct a large set of molecular descriptors using commonly available tools, introducing the use of energetic factors associated with conformational changes and disorder to order transitions, as well as features calculated on structural ensembles. The descriptors are used to train and test a binding free energy model using a consensus of four machine learning algorithms, whose performance constitutes a significant improvement over the other state of the art empirical free energy functions tested.

31448721,Renal length and volume prediction in healthy children.,"<h4>Introduction</h4>Little information is available regarding the evaluation of renal volume in healthy Latin-American children of different ages. The objective of this work was to establish a predictive model of renal size (volume and length) and develop a web-based calculator.<h4>Materials and methods</h4>A selective and representative sample was obtained randomly from the database of healthy children living in Resistencia city, Chaco, Argentina: a) the National Health Program for children under 6 years old; b)†school children until 18 years old (primary and middle education). Renal dimensions were obtained by ultrasonography via a single experienced operator at the indicated site (schools or primary health care centers). Renal volume was calculated using Dinkel's formula. A multiple linear regression model was applied using potential predictors. The final model was implemented in a free web-based application.<h4>Results</h4>Random selection was made from the database to include 882 subjects with ages between 0.03 and 230.63 months. The data was divided into two sets (one for training and the other for model testing). The training set (423) included 212 (50%) females. Significant predictors included age, height, current weight and birth weight, and the interaction between age and present weight. Using the test dataset, both renal volume and length root mean square errors were 5.06 cm<sup>3</sup> and 0.59 cm.<h4>Conclusion</h4>The prediction model was accurate and allowed for the development a freely-available web app: Renal size prediction (https://porbm28.shinyapps.io/RenalVolume/). Once the models are validated by additional studies, the app could be a useful tool to predict renal volume and length in pediatric clinical practice.",0,
IND607223097,Characterization of transcriptomes from sexual and asexual lineages of a New Zealand snail (Potamopyrgus antipodarum),"Understanding the evolution and maintenance of sexual reproduction is one of the central challenges of evolutionary biology, yet we know very little about how sex influences molecular evolution. The New Zealand freshwater snail Potamopyrgus antipodarum is ideally suited to address this knowledge gap because obligately sexual individuals often coexist with multiple independently derived obligately asexual lineages. This unusual situation allows direct comparisons both between sexual and asexual P. antipodarum and across populations that differ in the relative frequency of sexual individuals. As such, P. antipodarum has received a great deal of attention as a model system for the maintenance of sex in nature and is also used as a model for environmental toxicology and biological invasions. Molecular genetic resources for P. antipodarum will thus be useful to investigators in a variety of biological fields. We used 454 sequencing of cDNA libraries to generate transcriptomes from two sexual and two asexual P. antipodarum lineages. A de novo assembly of 116.7†Mb of sequence reads produced 41†396 contigs, and sequence similarity-based Gene Ontology annotations were obtained for 3740 contigs. We detected 408†315 SNP loci and 7315 microsatellite loci, which together represent the first genome-scale resource available for P. antipodarum.

25329667,Accurate assignment of significance to neuropeptide identifications using Monte Carlo k-permuted decoy databases.,"In support of accurate neuropeptide identification in mass spectrometry experiments, novel Monte Carlo permutation testing was used to compute significance values. Testing was based on k-permuted decoy databases, where k denotes the number of permutations. These databases were integrated with a range of peptide identification indicators from three popular open-source database search software (OMSSA, Crux, and X! Tandem) to assess the statistical significance of neuropeptide spectra matches. Significance p-values were computed as the fraction of the sequences in the database with match indicator value better than or equal to the true target spectra. When applied to a test-bed of all known manually annotated mouse neuropeptides, permutation tests with k-permuted decoy databases identified up to 100% of the neuropeptides at p-value < 10(-5). The permutation test p-values using hyperscore (X! Tandem), E-value (OMSSA) and Sp score (Crux) match indicators outperformed all other match indicators. The robust performance to detect peptides of the intuitive indicator ""number of matched ions between the experimental and theoretical spectra"" highlights the importance of considering this indicator when the p-value was borderline significant. Our findings suggest permutation decoy databases of size 1◊105 are adequate to accurately detect neuropeptides and this can be exploited to increase the speed of the search. The straightforward Monte Carlo permutation testing (comparable to a zero order Markov model) can be easily combined with existing peptide identification software to enable accurate and effective neuropeptide detection.

These data often require standard sorting, processing, and analysis operations to be performed in order to answer research questions. Visualization of these data is also crucial. This manuscript presents biomechZoo, an open-source toolbox that provides tools and graphical user interfaces to help users achieve these goals. The aims of this manuscript are to (1) introduce the main features of the toolbox, including a virtual three-dimensional environment to animate motion data (Director), a data plotting suite (Ensembler), and functions for the computation of three-dimensional lower-limb joint angles, moments, and power and (2) compare these computations to those of an existing validated system. To these ends, the steps required to process and analyze a sample data set via the toolbox are outlined. The data set comprises three-dimensional marker, ground reaction force (GRF), joint kinematic, and joint kinetic data of subjects performing straight walking and 90∞ turning manoeuvres. Joint kinematics and kinetics processed within the toolbox were found to be similar to outputs from a commercial system. The biomechZoo toolbox represents the work of several years and multiple contributors to provide a flexible platform to examine time-series data sets typical in the movement sciences. The toolbox has previously been used to process and analyse walking, running, and ice hockey data sets, and can integrate existing routines, such as the KineMat toolbox, for additional analyses. The toolbox can help researchers and clinicians new to programming or biomechanics to process and analyze their data through a customizable workflow, while advanced users are encouraged to contribute additional functionality to the project. Students may benefit from using biomechZoo as a learning and research tool. It is hoped that the toolbox can play a role in advancing research in the movement sciences.

22276777,miRdSNP: a database of disease-associated SNPs and microRNA target sites on 3'UTRs of human genes.,"<h4>Background</h4>Single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) can lead to the susceptibility and onset of diseases through their effects on gene expression at the posttranscriptional level. Recent findings indicate that SNPs could create, destroy, or modify the efficiency of miRNA binding to the 3'UTR of a gene, resulting in gene dysregulation. With the rapidly growing number of published disease-associated SNPs (dSNPs), there is a strong need for resources specifically recording dSNPs on the 3'UTRs and their nucleotide distance from miRNA target sites. We present here miRdSNP, a database incorporating three important areas of dSNPs, miRNA target sites, and diseases.<h4>Description</h4>miRdSNP provides a unique database of dSNPs on the 3'UTRs of human genes manually curated from PubMed. The current release includes 786 dSNP-disease associations for 630 unique dSNPs and 204 disease types. miRdSNP annotates genes with experimentally confirmed targeting by miRNAs and indexes miRNA target sites predicted by TargetScan and PicTar as well as potential miRNA target sites newly generated by dSNPs. A robust web interface and search tools are provided for studying the proximity of miRNA binding sites to dSNPs in relation to human diseases. Searches can be dynamically filtered by gene name, miRBase ID, target prediction algorithm, disease, and any nucleotide distance between dSNPs and miRNA target sites. Results can be viewed at the sequence level showing the annotated locations for miRNA target sites and dSNPs on the entire 3'UTR sequences. The integration of dSNPs with the UCSC Genome browser is also supported.<h4>Conclusion</h4>miRdSNP provides a comprehensive data source of dSNPs and robust tools for exploring their distance from miRNA target sites on the 3'UTRs of human genes. miRdSNP enables researchers to further explore the molecular mechanism of gene dysregulation for dSNPs at posttranscriptional level. miRdSNP is freely available on the web at http://mirdsnp.ccr.buffalo.edu.",1,
26150785,The PREP pipeline: standardized preprocessing for large-scale EEG analysis.,"The technology to collect brain imaging and physiological measures has become portable and ubiquitous, opening the possibility of large-scale analysis of real-world human imaging. By its nature, such data is large and complex, making automated processing essential. This paper shows how lack of attention to the very early stages of an EEG preprocessing pipeline can reduce the signal-to-noise ratio and introduce unwanted artifacts into the data, particularly for computations done in single precision. We demonstrate that ordinary average referencing improves the signal-to-noise ratio, but that noisy channels can contaminate the results. We also show that identification of noisy channels depends on the reference and examine the complex interaction of filtering, noisy channel identification, and referencing. We introduce a multi-stage robust referencing scheme to deal with the noisy channel-reference interaction. We propose a standardized early-stage EEG processing pipeline (PREP) and discuss the application of the pipeline to more than 600 EEG datasets. The pipeline includes an automatically generated report for each dataset processed. Users can download the PREP pipeline as a freely available MATLAB library from http://eegstudy.org/prepcode.",0,

In 2011 to 2012, severe and widespread outbreaks were documented across the United States mainland, resulting in considerable economic losses. On May 5, 2013, downy mildew disease symptoms were observed from I. walleriana 'Super Elfin' at a retail nursery in Mililani, on the Hawai'ian island of Oahu. Throughout May and June 2013, additional sightings of the disease were documented from the islands of Oahu, Kauai, Maui, and Hawai'i from nurseries, home gardens, and botanical park and landscape plantings. Symptoms of infected plants initially showed downward leaf curl, followed by a stippled chlorotic appearance on the adaxial leaf surfaces. Abaxial leaf surfaces were covered with a layer of white mycelia. Affected plants exhibited defoliation, flower drop, and stem rot as the disease progressed. Based on morphological and molecular data, the organism was identified as Plasmopara obducens (J. Schrˆt.) J. Schrˆt. Microscopic observation disclosed coenocytic mycelium and hyaline, thin-walled, tree-like (monopodial branches), straight, 94.0 to 300.0 ◊ 3.2 to 10.8 µm sporangiophores. Ovoid, hyaline sporangia measuring 11.0 to 14.6 ◊ 12.2 to 16.2 (average 13.2 ◊ 14.7) µm were borne on sterigma tips of rigid branchlets (8.0 to 15.0 µm) at right angle to the main axis of the sporangiophores (1,3). Molecular identification of the pathogen was conducted by removing hyphae from the surface of three heavily infected leaves using sterile tweezers, then extracting DNA using the QIAGEN Plant DNA kit (QIAGEN, Gaithersburg, MD). The nuclear rDNA internal transcribed spacer was sequenced from each of the three samples bidirectionally from Illustra EXOStar (GE Healthcare, Piscataway, NJ) purified amplicon generated from primers ITS1-O and LR-0R (4). Resultant sequences (GenBank KF366378 to 80) shared 99 to 100% nucleotide identity with P. obducens accession DQ665666 (4). A voucher specimen (BPI892676) was deposited in the U.S. National Fungus Collections, Beltsville, MD. Pathogenicity tests were performed by spraying 6-week-old impatiens plants (I. walleriana var. Super Elfin) grown singly in 4-inch pots with a suspension of 1 ◊ 10<sup>4</sup> P. obducens sporangia/ml until runoff using a handheld atomizer. Control plants were sprayed with distilled water. The plants were kept in high humidity by covering with black plastic bags for 48 h at 20∞C, and then maintained in the greenhouse (night/day temperature of 20/24∞C). The first symptoms (downward curling and chlorotic stippling of leaves) and sporulation of the pathogen on under-leaf surfaces of the inoculated plants appeared at 10 days and 21 days after inoculation, respectively. Control plants remained healthy. Morphological features and measurements matched those of the original inoculum, thus fulfilling Koch's postulates. To our knowledge, this is the first report of downy mildew on I. walleriana in Hawai'i (2). The disease appears to be widespread throughout the islands and is likely to cause considerable losses in Hawai'ian landscapes and production settings. References: (1) O. Constantinescu.

28981577,'Multi-omic' data analysis using O-miner.,"Innovations in -omics technologies have driven advances in biomedical research. However, integrating and analysing the large volumes of data generated from different high-throughput -omics technologies remain a significant challenge to basic and clinical scientists without bioinformatics skills or access to bioinformatics support. To address this demand, we have significantly updated our previous O-miner analytical suite, to incorporate several new features and data types to provide an efficient and easy-to-use Web tool for the automated analysis of data from '-omics' technologies. Created from a biologist's perspective, this tool allows for the automated analysis of large and complex transcriptomic, genomic and methylomic data sets, together with biological/clinical information, to identify significantly altered pathways and prioritize novel biomarkers/targets for biological validation. Our resource can be used to analyse both in-house data and the huge amount of publicly available information from array and sequencing platforms. Multiple data sets can be easily combined, allowing for meta-analyses. Here, we describe the analytical pipelines currently available in O-miner and present examples of use to demonstrate its utility and relevance in maximizing research output.

23734622,Biotea: RDFizing PubMed Central in support for the paper as an interface to the Web of Data.,"<h4>Background</h4>The World Wide Web has become a dissemination platform for scientific and non-scientific publications. However, most of the information remains locked up in discrete documents that are not always interconnected or machine-readable. The connectivity tissue provided by RDF technology has not yet been widely used to support the generation of self-describing, machine-readable documents.<h4>Results</h4>In this paper, we present our approach to the generation of self-describing machine-readable scholarly documents. We understand the scientific document as an entry point and interface to the Web of Data. We have semantically processed the full-text, open-access subset of PubMed Central. Our RDF model and resulting dataset make extensive use of existing ontologies and semantic enrichment services. We expose our model, services, prototype, and datasets at http://biotea.idiginfo.org/<h4>Conclusions</h4>The semantic processing of biomedical literature presented in this paper embeds documents within the Web of Data and facilitates the execution of concept-based queries against the entire digital library. Our approach delivers a flexible and adaptable set of tools for metadata enrichment and semantic processing of biomedical documents. Our model delivers a semantically rich and highly interconnected dataset with self-describing content so that software can make effective use of it.",1,
21493653,A robust and accurate binning algorithm for metagenomic sequences with arbitrary species abundance ratio.,"<h4>Motivation</h4>With the rapid development of next-generation sequencing techniques, metagenomics, also known as environmental genomics, has emerged as an exciting research area that enables us to analyze the microbial environment in which we live. An important step for metagenomic data analysis is the identification and taxonomic characterization of DNA fragments (reads or contigs) resulting from sequencing a sample of mixed species. This step is referred to as 'binning'. Binning algorithms that are based on sequence similarity and sequence composition markers rely heavily on the reference genomes of known microorganisms or phylogenetic markers. Due to the limited availability of reference genomes and the bias and low availability of markers, these algorithms may not be applicable in all cases. Unsupervised binning algorithms which can handle fragments from unknown species provide an alternative approach. However, existing unsupervised binning algorithms only work on datasets either with balanced species abundance ratios or rather different abundance ratios, but not both.<h4>Results</h4>In this article, we present MetaCluster 3.0, an integrated binning method based on the unsupervised top--down separation and bottom--up merging strategy, which can bin metagenomic fragments of species with very balanced abundance ratios (say 1:1) to very different abundance ratios (e.g. 1:24) with consistently higher accuracy than existing methods.<h4>Availability</h4>MetaCluster 3.0 can be downloaded at http://i.cs.hku.hk/~alse/MetaCluster/.",0,
28539606,SesameFG: an integrated database for the functional genomics of sesame.,"Sesame (Sesamum indicum L.) has high oil content, a small diploid genome and a short growth period, making it an attractive species for genetic studies on oilseed crops. With the advancement of next-generation sequencing technology, genomics and functional genomics research of sesame has developed quickly in the last few years, and large amounts of data have been generated. However, these results are distributed in many different publications, and there is a lack of integration. To promote functional genomics research of sesame, we collected genetic information combined with comprehensive phenotypic information and integrated them in the web-based database named SesameFG. The current version of SesameFG contains phenotypic information on agronomic traits of 705 sesame accessions, de novo assembled genomes of three sesame varieties, massive numbers of identified SNPs, gene expression profiles of five tissues, gene families, candidate genes for the important agronomic traits and genomic-SSR markers. All phenotypic and genotypic information in SesameFG is available for online queries and can be downloaded freely.

33816867,"Citation.js: a format-independent, modular bibliography tool for the browser and command line.","<h4>Background</h4>Given the vast number of standards and formats for bibliographical data, any program working with bibliographies and citations has to be able to interpret such data. This paper describes the development of Citation.js (https://citation.js.org/), a tool to parse and format according to those standards. The program follows modern guidelines for software in general and JavaScript in specific, such as version control, source code analysis, integration testing and semantic versioning.<h4>Results</h4>The result is an extensible tool that has already seen adaption in a variety of sources and use cases: as part of a server-side page generator of a publishing platform, as part of a local extensible document generator, and as part of an in-browser converter of extracted references. Use cases range from transforming a list of DOIs or Wikidata identifiers into a BibTeX file on the command line, to displaying RIS references on a webpage with added Altmetric badges to generating ""How to cite this"" sections on a blog. The accuracy of conversions is currently 27% for properties and 60% for types on average and a typical initialization takes 120 ms in browsers and 1 s with Node.js on the command line.<h4>Conclusions</h4>Citation.js is a library supporting various formats of bibliographic information in a broad selection of use cases and environments. Given the support for plugins, more formats can be added with relative ease.",0,
26910751,MDI-GPU: accelerating integrative modelling for genomic-scale data using GP-GPU computing.,"The integration of multi-dimensional datasets remains a key challenge in systems biology and genomic medicine. Modern high-throughput technologies generate a broad array of different data types, providing distinct--but often complementary--information. However, the large amount of data adds burden to any inference task. Flexible Bayesian methods may reduce the necessity for strong modelling assumptions, but can also increase the computational burden. We present an improved implementation of a Bayesian correlated clustering algorithm, that permits integrated clustering to be routinely performed across multiple datasets, each with tens of thousands of items. By exploiting GPU based computation, we are able to improve runtime performance of the algorithm by almost four orders of magnitude. This permits analysis across genomic-scale data sets, greatly expanding the range of applications over those originally possible.

21411447,Using computational predictions to improve literature-based Gene Ontology annotations: a feasibility study.,"Annotation using Gene Ontology (GO) terms is one of the most important ways in which biological information about specific gene products can be expressed in a searchable, computable form that may be compared across genomes and organisms. Because literature-based GO annotations are often used to propagate functional predictions between related proteins, their accuracy is critically important. We present a strategy that employs a comparison of literature-based annotations with computational predictions to identify and prioritize genes whose annotations need review. Using this method, we show that comparison of manually assigned 'unknown' annotations in the Saccharomyces Genome Database (SGD) with InterPro-based predictions can identify annotations that need to be updated. A survey of literature-based annotations and computational predictions made by the Gene Ontology Annotation (GOA) project at the European Bioinformatics Institute (EBI) across several other databases shows that this comparison strategy could be used to maintain and improve the quality of GO annotations for other organisms besides yeast. The survey also shows that although GOA-assigned predictions are the most comprehensive source of functional information for many genomes, a large proportion of genes in a variety of different organisms entirely lack these predictions but do have manual annotations. This underscores the critical need for manually performed, literature-based curation to provide functional information about genes that are outside the scope of widely used computational methods. Thus, the combination of manual and computational methods is essential to provide the most accurate and complete functional annotation of a genome. Database URL: http://www.yeastgenome.org.",1,
23956306,Incorporating prior knowledge into Gene Network Study.,"<h4>Motivation</h4>A major goal in genomic research is to identify genes that may jointly influence a biological response. From many years of intensive biomedical research, a large body of biological knowledge, or pathway information, has accumulated in available databases. There is a strong interest in leveraging these pathways to improve the statistical power and interpretability in studying gene networks associated with complex phenotypes. This prior information is a valuable complement to large-scale genomic data such as gene expression data generated from microarrays. However, it is a non-trivial task to effectively integrate available biological knowledge into gene expression data when reconstructing gene networks.<h4>Results</h4>In this article, we developed and applied a Lasso method from a Bayesian perspective, a method we call prior Lasso (pLasso), for the reconstruction of gene networks. In this method, we partition edges between genes into two subsets: one subset of edges is present in known pathways, whereas the other has no prior information associated. Our method assigns different prior distributions to each subset according to a modified Bayesian information criterion that incorporates prior knowledge on both the network structure and the pathway information. Simulation studies have indicated that the method is more effective in recovering the underlying network than a traditional Lasso method that does not use the prior information. We applied pLasso to microarray gene expression datasets, where we used information from the Pathway Commons (PC) and the Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) as prior information for the network reconstruction, and successfully identified network hub genes associated with clinical outcome in cancer patients.<h4>Availability</h4>The source code is available at http://nba.uth.tmc.edu/homepage/liu/pLasso.",0,

In low-quality assemblies, and even some high-quality assemblies, certain gene regions are still incomplete; thus, novel scaffolding approaches are required to complete gene regions.<h4>Results</h4>We developed an efficient and fast genome scaffolding method called PEP_scaffolder, using proteins to scaffold genomes. The pipeline aims to recover protein-coding gene structures. We tested the method on human contigs; using human UniProt proteins as guides, the improvement on N50 size was 17% increase with an accuracy of ~97%. PEP_scaffolder improved the proportion of fully covered proteins among all proteins, which was close to the proportion in the finished genome. The method provided a high accuracy of 91% using orthologs of distant species. Tested on simulated fly contigs, PEP_scaffolder outperformed other scaffolders, with the shortest running time and the highest accuracy.<h4>Availability and implementation</h4>The software is freely available at http://www.fishbrowser.org/software/PEP_scaffolder/ CONTACT: lijt@cafs.ac.cnSupplementary information: Supplementary data are available at Bioinformatics online.",0,

33996891,Universal Architectural Concepts Underlying Protein Folding Patterns.,"What is the architectural ""basis set"" of the observed universe of protein structures? Using information-theoretic inference, we answer this question with a dictionary of 1,493 substructures-called <i>concepts</i>-typically at a subdomain level, based on an unbiased subset of known protein structures. Each <i>concept</i> represents a topologically conserved assembly of helices and strands that make contact. Any protein structure can be dissected into instances of concepts from this dictionary. We dissected the Protein Data Bank and completely inventoried all the concept instances. This yields many insights, including correlations between concepts and catalytic activities or binding sites, useful for rational drug design; local amino-acid sequence-structure correlations, useful for <i>ab initio</i> structure prediction methods; and information supporting the recognition and exploration of evolutionary relationships, useful for structural studies. An interactive site, ProÁodic, at http://lcb.infotech.monash.edu.au/prosodic (click), provides access to and navigation of the entire dictionary of concepts and their usages, and all associated information.

22303453,Catalog of microRNA seed polymorphisms in vertebrates.,"MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are a class of non-coding RNA that plays an important role in posttranscriptional regulation of mRNA. Evidence has shown that miRNA gene variability might interfere with its function resulting in phenotypic variation and disease susceptibility. A major role in miRNA target recognition is ascribed to complementarity with the miRNA seed region that can be affected by polymorphisms. In the present study, we developed an online tool for the detection of miRNA polymorphisms (miRNA SNiPer) in vertebrates (http://www.integratomics-time.com/miRNA-SNiPer) and generated a catalog of miRNA seed region polymorphisms (miR-seed-SNPs) consisting of 149 SNPs in six species. Although a majority of detected polymorphisms were due to point mutations, two consecutive nucleotide substitutions (double nucleotide polymorphisms, DNPs) were also identified in nine miRNAs. We determined that miR-SNPs are frequently located within the quantitative trait loci (QTL), chromosome fragile sites, and cancer susceptibility loci, indicating their potential role in the genetic control of various complex traits. To test this further, we performed an association analysis between the mmu-miR-717 seed SNP rs30372501, which is polymorphic in a large number of standard inbred strains, and all phenotypic traits in these strains deposited in the Mouse Phenome Database. Analysis showed a significant association between the mmu-miR-717 seed SNP and a diverse array of traits including behavior, blood-clinical chemistry, body weight size and growth, and immune system suggesting that seed SNPs can indeed have major pleiotropic effects. The bioinformatics analyses, data and tools developed in the present study can serve researchers as a starting point in testing more targeted hypotheses and designing experiments using optimal species or strains for further mechanistic studies.",1,

23761447,ResponseNet2.0: Revealing signaling and regulatory pathways connecting your proteins and genes--now with human data.,"Genome sequencing and transcriptomic profiling are two widely used approaches for the identification of human disease pathways. However, each approach typically provides a limited view of disease pathways: Genome sequencing can identify disease-related mutations but rarely reveals their mode-of-action, while transcriptomic assays do not reveal the series of events that lead to the transcriptomic change. ResponseNet is an integrative network-optimization approach that we developed to fill these gaps by highlighting major signaling and regulatory molecular interaction paths that connect disease-related mutations and genes. The ResponseNet web-server provides a user-friendly interface to ResponseNet. Specifically, users can upload weighted lists of proteins and genes and obtain a sparse, weighted, molecular interaction subnetwork connecting them, that is biased toward regulatory and signaling pathways. ResponseNet2.0 enhances the functionality of the ResponseNet web-server in two important ways.

The identification of TF-target regulatory relationships is a key step for revealing functions of TFs and their regulations on gene expression. The accumulated data of chromatin immunoprecipitation sequencing (ChIP-seq) provide great opportunities to discover the TF-target regulations across different conditions. In this study, we constructed a database named hTFtarget, which integrated huge human TF target resources (7190 ChIP-seq samples of 659 TFs and high-confidence binding sites of 699 TFs) and epigenetic modification information to predict accurate TF-target regulations. hTFtarget offers the following functions for users to explore TF-target regulations: (1) browse or search general targets of a query TF across datasets; (2) browse TF-target regulations for a query TF in a specific dataset or tissue; (3) search potential TFs for a given target gene or non-coding RNA; (4) investigate co-association between TFs in cell lines; (5) explore potential co-regulations for given target genes or TFs; (6) predict candidate TF binding sites on given DNA sequences; (7) visualize ChIP-seq peaks for different TFs and conditions in a genome browser. hTFtarget provides a comprehensive, reliable and user-friendly resource for exploring human TF-target regulations, which will be very useful for a wide range of users in the TF and gene expression regulation community. hTFtarget is available at http://bioinfo.life.hust.edu.cn/hTFtarget.",1,
25855375,Alterations of Functional Connectivity Among Resting-State Networks in Hypothyroidism.,"Hypothyroidism affects brain functioning as suggested by various neuroimaging studies. The primary focus of the present study was to examine whether hypothyroidism would impact connectivity among resting-state networks (RSNs) using resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging (rsfMRI). Twenty-two patients with hypothyroidism and 22 healthy controls were recruited and scanned using rsfMRI. The data were analysed using independent component analysis and a dual regression approach that was applied on five RSNs that were identified using fsl software (http://fsl.fmrib.ox.ac.uk). Hypothyroid patients showed significantly decreased functional connectivity in the regions of the right frontoparietal network (frontal pole), the medial visual network (lateral occipital gyrus, precuneus cortex and cuneus) and the motor network (precentral gyrus, postcentral gyrus, precuneus cortex, paracingulate gyrus, cingulate gyrus and supramarginal gyrus) compared to healthy controls. The reduced functional connectivity in the right frontoparietal network, the medial visual network and the motor network suggests neurocognitive alterations in hypothyroid patients in the corresponding functions. However, the study would be further continued to investigate the effects of thyroxine treatment and correlation with neurocognitive scores. The findings of the present study provide further interesting insights into our understanding of the action of thyroid hormone on the adult human brain.",0,
33751898,Rate of Communicative Gestures and Developmental Outcomes in Toddlers With and Without Autism Spectrum Disorder During a Home Observation.,"Purpose Most toddlers with autism spectrum disorder and other developmental delays receive early intervention at home and may not participate in a clinic-based communication evaluation. However, there is limited research that has prospectively examined communication in very young children with and without autism in a home-based setting. This study used granular observational coding to document the communicative acts performed by toddlers with autism, developmental delay, and typical development in the home environment. Method Children were selected from the archival database of the FIRST WORDS Project (<i>N</i> = 211). At approximately 20 months of age, each child participated in everyday activities with a caregiver during an hour-long, video-recorded, naturalistic home observation. Inventories of unique gestures, rates per minute, and proportions of types of communicative acts and communicative functions were coded and compared using a one-way analysis of variance. Concurrent and prospective relationships between rate of communication and measures of social communication, language development, and autism symptoms were examined. Results A total of 40,738 communicative acts were coded. Children with autism, developmental delay, and typical development used eight, nine, and 12 unique gestures on average, respectively. Children with autism used deictic gestures, vocalizations, and communicative acts for behavior regulation at significantly lower rates than the other groups. Statistically significant correlations were observed between rate of communication and several outcome measures. Conclusion Observation of social communication in the natural environment may improve early identification of children with autism and communication delays, complement clinic-based assessments, and provide useful information about a child's social communication profile and the family's preferred activities and intervention priorities.

24712981,SFGD: a comprehensive platform for mining functional information from soybean transcriptome data and its use in identifying acyl-lipid metabolism pathways.,"<h4>Background</h4>Soybean (Glycine max L.) is one of the world's most important leguminous crops producing high-quality protein and oil. Increasing the relative oil concentration in soybean seeds is many researchers' goal, but a complete analysis platform of functional annotation for the genes involved in the soybean acyl-lipid pathway is still lacking. Following the success of soybean whole-genome sequencing, functional annotation has become a major challenge for the scientific community. Whole-genome transcriptome analysis is a powerful way to predict genes with biological functions. It is essential to build a comprehensive analysis platform for integrating soybean whole-genome sequencing data, the available transcriptome data and protein information. This platform could also be used to identify acyl-lipid metabolism pathways.<h4>Description</h4>In this study, we describe our construction of the Soybean Functional Genomics Database (SFGD) using Generic Genome Browser (Gbrowse) as the core platform. We integrated microarray expression profiling with 255 samples from 14 groups' experiments and mRNA-seq data with 30 samples from four groups' experiments, including spatial and temporal transcriptome data for different soybean development stages and environmental stresses. The SFGD includes a gene co-expression regulatory network containing 23,267 genes and 1873 miRNA-target pairs, and a group of acyl-lipid pathways containing 221 enzymes and more than 1550 genes. The SFGD also provides some key analysis tools, i.e. BLAST search, expression pattern search and cis-element significance analysis, as well as gene ontology information search and single nucleotide polymorphism display.<h4>Conclusion</h4>The SFGD is a comprehensive database integrating genome and transcriptome data, and also for soybean acyl-lipid metabolism pathways. It provides useful toolboxes for biologists to improve the accuracy and robustness of soybean functional genomics analysis, further improving understanding of gene regulatory networks for effective crop improvement. The SFGD is publically accessible at http://bioinformatics.cau.edu.cn/SFGD/, with all data available for downloading.",1,

Rates of certified nurse-midwife (CNM)-attended births more than doubled between 1989 (3.3% of all births) and 2002 (7.7%) and have remained steady since. This article examines trends in midwife-attended births from 1989 to 2009.<h4>Methods</h4>The data in this report are based on records gathered as part of the US National Standard Certificate of Live Birth from a public use Web site, Vital Stats (http://www.cdc.gov/nchs/VitalStats.htm), that allows users to create and download specialized tables.<h4>Results</h4>Between 2007 and 2009, the proportion of all births attended by CNMs increased by 4% from 7.3% of all births to 7.6% and a total of 313,516. This represents a decline in total births attended by CNMs from 2008 but a higher proportion of all births because total US births dropped at a faster rate. The proportion of vaginal births attended by CNMs reached an all-time high of 11.4% in 2009. There were strong regional patterns to the distribution of CNM-attended births. Births attended by ""other midwives"" rose to 21,787 or 0.5% of all US births, and the total proportion of all births attended by midwives reached an all-time high of 8.1%. The race/ethnicity of mothers attended by CNMs has shifted over the years. In 1990, CNMs attended a disproportionately high number of births to non-white mothers, whereas in 2009, the profile of CNM births mirrors the national distribution in race/ethnicity.<h4>Discussion</h4>Midwife-attended births in the United States are increasing. The geographic patterns in the distribution of midwife-attended births warrant further study.",0,
27199454,Comprehensive database of human E3 ubiquitin ligases: application to aquaporin-2 regulation.,"Aquaporin-2 (AQP2) is regulated in part via vasopressin-mediated changes in protein half-life that are in turn dependent on AQP2 ubiquitination. Here we addressed the question, ""What E3 ubiquitin ligase is most likely to be responsible for AQP2 ubiquitination?"" using large-scale data integration based on Bayes' rule. The first step was to bioinformatically identify all E3 ligase genes coded by the human genome. The 377 E3 ubiquitin ligases identified in the human genome, consisting predominant of HECT, RING, and U-box proteins, have been used to create a publically accessible and downloadable online database (https://hpcwebapps.cit.nih.gov/ESBL/Database/E3-ligases/). We also curated a second database of E3 ligase accessory proteins that included BTB domain proteins, cullins, SOCS-box proteins, and F-box proteins. Using Bayes' theorem to integrate information from multiple large-scale proteomic and transcriptomic datasets, we ranked these 377 E3 ligases with respect to their probability of interaction with AQP2. Application of Bayes' rule identified the E3 ligases most likely to interact with AQP2 as (in order of probability): NEDD4 and NEDD4L (tied for first), AMFR, STUB1, ITCH, ZFPL1. Significantly, the two E3 ligases tied for top rank have also been studied extensively in the reductionist literature as regulatory proteins in renal tubule epithelia. The concordance of conclusions from reductionist and systems-level data provides strong motivation for further studies of the roles of NEDD4 and NEDD4L in the regulation of AQP2 protein turnover.",1,
29761459,Mouse Genome Informatics (MGI) Is the International Resource for Information on the¬†Laboratory Mouse.,"Mouse Genome Informatics (MGI, http://www.informatics.jax.org/ ) web resources provide free access to meticulously curated information about the laboratory mouse. MGI's primary goal is to help researchers investigate the genetic foundations of human diseases by translating information from mouse phenotypes and disease models studies to human systems. MGI provides comprehensive phenotypes for over 50,000 mutant alleles in mice and provides experimental model descriptions for over 1500 human diseases. Curated data from scientific publications are integrated with those from high-throughput phenotyping and gene expression centers. Data are standardized using defined, hierarchical vocabularies such as the Mammalian Phenotype (MP) Ontology, Mouse Developmental Anatomy and the Gene Ontologies (GO). This chapter introduces you to Gene and Allele Detail pages and provides step-by-step instructions for simple searches and those that take advantage of the breadth of MGI data integration.",1,
21943375,"Reptilian-transcriptome v1.0, a glimpse in the brain transcriptome of five divergent Sauropsida lineages and the phylogenetic position of turtles.","<h4>Background</h4>Reptiles are largely under-represented in comparative genomics despite the fact that they are substantially more diverse in many respects than mammals. Given the high divergence of reptiles from classical model species, next-generation sequencing of their transcriptomes is an approach of choice for gene identification and annotation.<h4>Results</h4>Here, we use 454 technology to sequence the brain transcriptome of four divergent reptilian and one reference avian species: the Nile crocodile, the corn snake, the bearded dragon, the red-eared turtle, and the chicken. Using an in-house pipeline for recursive similarity searches of >3,000,000 reads against multiple databases from 7 reference vertebrates, we compile a reptilian comparative transcriptomics dataset, with homology assignment for 20,000 to 31,000 transcripts per species and a cumulated non-redundant sequence length of 248.6 Mbases. Our approach identifies the majority (87%) of chicken brain transcripts and about 50% of de novo assembled reptilian transcripts. In addition to 57,502 microsatellite loci, we identify thousands of SNP and indel polymorphisms for population genetic and linkage analyses. We also build very large multiple alignments for Sauropsida and mammals (two million residues per species) and perform extensive phylogenetic analyses suggesting that turtles are not basal living reptiles but are rather associated with Archosaurians, hence, potentially answering a long-standing question in the phylogeny of Amniotes.<h4>Conclusions</h4>The reptilian transcriptome (freely available at http://www.reptilian-transcriptomes.org) should prove a useful new resource as reptiles are becoming important new models for comparative genomics, ecology, and evolutionary developmental genetics.",1,
28472230,OMSim: a simulator for optical map data.,"<h4>Motivation</h4>The Bionano Genomics platform allows for the optical detection of short sequence patterns in very long DNA molecules (up to 2.5 Mbp). Molecules with overlapping patterns can be assembled to generate a consensus optical map of the entire genome. In turn, these optical maps can be used to validate or improve de novo genome assembly projects or to detect large-scale structural variation in genomes. Simulated optical map data can assist in the development and benchmarking of tools that operate on those data, such as alignment and assembly software. Additionally, it can help to optimize the experimental setup for a genome of interest. Such a simulator is currently not available.<h4>Results</h4>We have developed a simulator, OMSim, that produces synthetic optical map data that mimics real Bionano Genomics data. These simulated data have been tested for compatibility with the Bionano Genomics Irys software system and the Irys-scaffolding scripts. OMSim is capable of handling very large genomes (over 30 Gbp) with high throughput and low memory requirements.<h4>Availability and implementation</h4>The Python simulation tool and a cross-platform graphical user interface are available as open source software under the GNU GPL v2 license ( http://www.bioinformatics.intec.ugent.be/omsim ).<h4>Contact</h4>jan.fostier@ugent.be.<h4>Supplementary information</h4>Supplementary data are available at Bioinformatics online.",0,
31400221,Alternating EM algorithm for a bilinear model in isoform quantification from RNA-seq data.,"<h4>Motivation</h4>Estimation of isoform-level gene expression from RNA-seq data depends on simplifying assumptions, such as uniform read distribution, that are easily violated in real data. Such violations typically lead to biased estimates. Most existing methods provide bias correction step(s), which is based on biological considerations-such as GC content-and applied in single samples separately. The main problem is that not all biases are known.<h4>Results</h4>We have developed a novel method called XAEM based on a more flexible and robust statistical model. Existing methods are essentially based on a linear model Xﬂ, where the design matrix X is known and is computed based on the simplifying assumptions. In contrast XAEM considers Xﬂ as a bilinear model with both X and ﬂ unknown. Joint estimation of X and ﬂ is made possible by a simultaneous analysis of multi-sample RNA-seq data. Compared to existing methods, XAEM automatically performs empirical correction of potentially unknown biases. We use an alternating expectation-maximization (AEM) algorithm, alternating between estimation of X and ﬂ. For speed XAEM utilizes quasi-mapping for read alignment, thus leading to a fast algorithm. Overall XAEM performs favorably compared to recent advanced methods. For simulated datasets, XAEM obtains higher accuracy for multiple-isoform genes. In a differential-expression analysis of a real single-cell RNA-seq dataset, XAEM achieves substantially better rediscovery rates in independent validation sets.<h4>Availability and implementation</h4>The method and pipeline are implemented as a tool and freely available for use at http://fafner.meb.ki.se/biostatwiki/xaem/.<h4>Supplementary information</h4>Supplementary data are available at Bioinformatics online.",0,
30161123,Interactive implementations of thermodynamics-based RNA structure and RNA-RNA interaction prediction approaches for example-driven teaching.,"The investigation of RNA-based regulation of cellular processes is becoming an increasingly important part of biological or medical research. For the analysis of this type of data, RNA-related prediction tools are integrated into many pipelines and workflows. In order to correctly apply and tune these programs, the user has to have a precise understanding of their limitations and concepts. Within this manuscript, we provide the mathematical foundations and extract the algorithmic ideas that are core to state-of-the-art RNA structure and RNA-RNA interaction prediction algorithms. To allow the reader to change and adapt the algorithms or to play with different inputs, we provide an open-source web interface to JavaScript implementations and visualizations of each algorithm. The conceptual, teaching-focused presentation enables a high-level survey of the approaches, while providing sufficient details for understanding important concepts. This is boosted by the simple generation and study of examples using the web interface available at http://rna.informatik.uni-freiburg.de/Teaching/. In combination, we provide a valuable resource for teaching, learning, and understanding the discussed prediction tools and thus enable a more informed analysis of RNA-related effects.",0,
31236209,The research crisis in American institutions of complementary and integrative health: one proposed solution for chiropractic profession.,"A crisis confronts the Complementary and Integrative Health (CIH) teaching institutions in the US. Research infrastructure is needed to build and sustain productive research programs and retain their own research faculty. In most health professions, this infrastructure is largely built through research grants. In CIH, most educational institutions are funded through student tuition, which has historically also had to be the source for building their research programs. Only a limited number of these institutions have emerged as National Institute of Health (NIH) grant-funded programs. As a result, the American chiropractic institutions have seen a retrenchment in the number of active research programs. In addition, although research training programs e.g., NIH's K awards are available for CIH researchers, these programs generally result in these researchers leaving their institutions and depriving future CIH practitioners of the benefit of being trained in a culture of research. One proposed solution is to leverage the substantial research infrastructure and long history of collaboration available at the RAND Corporation (https://www.rand.org) This article presents the proposed five components of the RAND Center for Collaborative CIH Research and the steps required to bring it to being: 1) the CIH Research Network - an online resource and collaborative site for CIH researchers; 2) the CIH Research Advisory Board - the governing body for the Center selected by its members; 3) the RAND CIH Interest Group - a group of RAND researchers with an interest in and who could provide support to CIH research; 4) CIH Researcher Training - access to existing RAND research training as well as the potential for the Center to provide a research training home for those with training grants; and 5) CIH RAND Partnership for Research - a mentorship program to support successful CIH research. By necessity the first step in the Center's creation would be a meeting between the heads of interested CIH institutions to work out the details and to obtain buy-in. The future success of CIH-directed research on CIH will require a pooling of talent and resources across institutions; something that the American chiropractic institutions have not yet been able to achieve. This article discusses one possible solution.",0,
28172632,SEQualyzer: interactive tool for quality control and exploratory analysis of high-throughput RNA structural profiling data.,"<h4>Summary</h4>To serve numerous functional roles, RNA must fold into specific structures. Determining these structures is thus of paramount importance. The recent advent of high-throughput sequencing-based structure profiling experiments has provided important insights into RNA structure and widened the scope of RNA studies. However, as a broad range of approaches continues to emerge, a universal framework is needed to quantitatively ensure consistent and high-quality data. We present SEQualyzer, a visual and interactive application that makes it easy and efficient to gauge data quality, screen for transcripts with high-quality information and identify discordant replicates in structure profiling experiments. Our methods rely on features common to a wide range of protocols and can serve as standards for quality control and analyses.<h4>Availability and implementation</h4>SEQualyzer is written in R, is platform-independent, and is freely available at http://bme.ucdavis.edu/aviranlab/SEQualyzer.<h4>Contact</h4>saviran@ucdavis.edu<h4>Supplementary informantion</h4>Supplementary data are available at Bioinformatics online.",0,
24334622,Metagenomic frameworks for monitoring antibiotic resistance in aquatic environments.,"<h4>Background</h4>High-throughput genomic technologies offer new approaches for environmental health monitoring, including metagenomic surveillance of antibiotic resistance determinants (ARDs). Although natural environments serve as reservoirs for antibiotic resistance genes that can be transferred to pathogenic and human commensal bacteria, monitoring of these determinants has been infrequent and incomplete. Furthermore, surveillance efforts have not been integrated into public health decision making.<h4>Objectives</h4>We used a metagenomic epidemiology-based approach to develop an ARD index that quantifies antibiotic resistance potential, and we analyzed this index for common modal patterns across environmental samples. We also explored how metagenomic data such as this index could be conceptually framed within an early risk management context.<h4>Methods</h4>We analyzed 25 published data sets from shotgun pyrosequencing projects. The samples consisted of microbial community DNA collected from marine and freshwater environments across a gradient of human impact. We used principal component analysis to identify index patterns across samples.<h4>Results</h4>We observed significant differences in the overall index and index subcategory levels when comparing ecosystems more proximal versus distal to human impact. The selection of different sequence similarity thresholds strongly influenced the index measurements. Unique index subcategory modes distinguished the different metagenomes.<h4>Conclusions</h4>Broad-scale screening of ARD potential using this index revealed utility for framing environmental health monitoring and surveillance. This approach holds promise as a screening tool for establishing baseline ARD levels that can be used to inform and prioritize decision making regarding management of ARD sources and human exposure routes.<h4>Citation</h4>Port JA, Cullen AC, Wallace JC, Smith MN, Faustman EM. 2014.

31815677,Effectiveness of Smartphone App-Based Interactive Management on Glycemic Control in Chinese Patients With Poorly Controlled Diabetes: Randomized Controlled Trial.,"BACKGROUND:In recent years, the rapid development of mobile medical technology has provided multiple ways for the long-term management of chronic diseases, especially diabetes. As a new type of management model, smartphone apps are global, convenient, cheap, and interactive. Although apps were proved to be more effective at glycemic control, compared with traditional computer- and Web-based telemedicine technologies, how to gain a further and sustained improvement is still being explored. OBJECTIVE:The objective of this study was to investigate the effectiveness of an app-based interactive management model by a professional health care team on glycemic control in Chinese patients with poorly controlled diabetes. METHODS:This study was a 6-month long, single-center, prospective randomized controlled trial. A total of 276 type 1 or type 2 diabetes patients were enrolled and randomized to the control group (group A), app self-management group (group B), and app interactive management group (group C) in a 1:1:1 ratio. The primary outcome was the change in glycated hemoglobin (HbA1c) level. Missing data were handled by multiple imputation. RESULTS:At months 3 and 6, all 3 groups showed significant decreases in HbA1c levels (all P<.05). Patients in the app interactive management group had a significantly lower HbA1clevel than those in the app self-management group at 6 months (P=.04). The average HbA1c reduction in the app interactive management group was larger than that in the app self-management and control groups at both months 3 and 6 (all P<.05). However, no differences in HbA1c reduction were observed between the app self-management and control groups at both months 3 and 6 (both P>.05). Multivariate line regression analyses also showed that the app interactive management group was associated with the larger reduction of HbA1c compared with groups A and B at both months 3 and 6 (all P>.05). In addition, the app interactive management group had better control of triglyceride and high-density lipoprotein cholesterol levels at both months 3 and 6 compared with baseline (both P<.05). CONCLUSIONS:In Chinese patients with poorly controlled diabetes, it was difficult to achieve long-term effective glucose improvement by using app self-management alone, but combining it with interactive management can help achieve rapid and sustained glycemic control.

31368479,Bayesian estimation of genetic regulatory effects in high-throughput reporter assays.,"<h4>Motivation</h4>High-throughput reporter assays dramatically improve our ability to assign function to noncoding genetic variants, by measuring allelic effects on gene expression in the controlled setting of a reporter gene. Unlike genetic association tests, such assays are not confounded by linkage disequilibrium when loci are independently assayed. These methods can thus improve the identification of causal disease mutations. While work continues on improving experimental aspects of these assays, less effort has gone into developing methods for assessing the statistical significance of assay results, particularly in the case of rare variants captured from patient DNA.<h4>Results</h4>We describe a Bayesian hierarchical model, called Bayesian Inference of Regulatory Differences, which integrates prior information and explicitly accounts for variability between experimental replicates. The model produces substantially more accurate predictions than existing methods when allele frequencies are low, which is of clear advantage in the search for disease-causing variants in DNA captured from patient cohorts. Using the model, we demonstrate a clear tradeoff between variant sequencing coverage and numbers of biological replicates, and we show that the use of additional biological replicates decreases variance in estimates of effect size, due to the properties of the Poisson-binomial distribution. We also provide a power and sample size calculator, which facilitates decision making in experimental design parameters.<h4>Availability and implementation</h4>The software is freely available from www.geneprediction.org/bird. The experimental design web tool can be accessed at http://67.159.92.22:8080.<h4>Supplementary information</h4>Supplementary data are available at Bioinformatics online.",0,
26678663,EC: an efficient error correction algorithm for short reads.,"<h4>Background</h4>In highly parallel next-generation sequencing (NGS) techniques millions to billions of short reads are produced from a genomic sequence in a single run. Due to the limitation of the NGS technologies, there could be errors in the reads. The error rate of the reads can be reduced with trimming and by correcting the erroneous bases of the reads. It helps to achieve high quality data and the computational complexity of many biological applications will be greatly reduced if the reads are first corrected. We have developed a novel error correction algorithm called EC and compared it with four other state-of-the-art algorithms using both real and simulated sequencing reads.<h4>Results</h4>We have done extensive and rigorous experiments that reveal that EC is indeed an effective, scalable, and efficient error correction tool. Real reads that we have employed in our performance evaluation are Illumina-generated short reads of various lengths. Six experimental datasets we have utilized are taken from sequence and read archive (SRA) at NCBI. The simulated reads are obtained by picking substrings from random positions of reference genomes. To introduce errors, some of the bases of the simulated reads are changed to other bases with some probabilities.<h4>Conclusions</h4>Error correction is a vital problem in biology especially for NGS data. In this paper we present a novel algorithm, called Error Corrector (EC), for correcting substitution errors in biological sequencing reads. We plan to investigate the possibility of employing the techniques introduced in this research paper to handle insertion and deletion errors also.<h4>Software availability</h4>The implementation is freely available for non-commercial purposes. It can be downloaded from: http://engr.uconn.edu/~rajasek/EC.zip.",0,
21903624,Finding stable local optimal RNA secondary structures.,"<h4>Motivation</h4>Many RNAs, such as riboswitches, can fold into multiple alternate structures and perform different biological functions. These biologically functional structures usually have low free energies in their local energy landscapes and are very stable such that they cannot easily jump out of the current states and fold into other stable conformations. The conformational space of feasible RNA secondary structures is prohibitively large, and accurate prediction of functional structure conformations is challenging. Because the stability of an RNA secondary structure is determined predominantly by energetically favorable helical regions (stacks), we propose to use configurations of putative stacks to represent RNA secondary structures. By considering a reduced conformational space of local optimal stack configurations instead of all feasible RNA structures, we first present an algorithm for enumerating all possible local optimal stack configurations. In addition, we present a fast heuristic algorithm for approximating energy barriers encountered during folding pathways between each pair of local optimal stack configurations and finding all the stable local optimal structures.<h4>Results</h4>Benchmark tests have been conducted on several RNA riboswitches, whose alternate secondary structures have been experimentally verified. The benchmark results show that our method can successfully predict the native 'on' and 'off' secondary structures, and better rank them compared with other state-of-art approaches.<h4>Availability</h4>The software is freely available and can be downloaded at http://genome.ucf.edu/RNASLOpt.<h4>Contact</h4>shzhang@eecs.ucf.edu.<h4>Supplementary information</h4>Supplementary data are available at Bioinformatics online.",0,
24611578,Variation in surgical quality measure adherence within hospital referral regions: do publicly reported surgical quality measures distinguish among hospitals that patients are likely to compare?,"<h4>Objective</h4>To determine whether surgical quality measures that Medicare publicly reports provide a basis for patients to choose a hospital from within their geographic region.<h4>Data source</h4>The Department of Health and Human Services' public reporting website, http://www.medicare.gov/hospitalcompare.<h4>Study design</h4>We identified hospitals (n†=†2,953) reporting adherence rates to the quality measures intended to reduce surgical site infections (Surgical Care Improvement Project, 1-3) in 2012. We defined regions within which patients were likely to compare hospitals using the hospital referral regions (HRRs) from the Dartmouth Atlas of Health Care Project. We described distributions of reported SCIP adherence within each HRR, including medians, interquartile ranges (IQRs), skewness, and outliers.<h4>Principal findings</h4>Ninety-seven percent of HRRs had median SCIP-1 scores =95 percent. In 93 percent of HRRs, half of the hospitals in the HRR were within 5 percent of the median hospital's score. In 62 percent of HRRs, hospitals were skewed toward the higher rates (negative skewness). Seven percent of HRRs demonstrated positive skewness. Only 1 percent had a positive outlier. SCIP-2 and SCIP-3 demonstrated similar distributions.<h4>Conclusions</h4>Publicly reported quality measures for surgical site infection prevention do not distinguish the majority of hospitals that patients are likely to choose from when selecting a surgical provider. More studies are needed to improve public reporting's ability to positively impact patient decision making.",0,
33058887,How the CORAL software can be used to select compounds for efficient treatment of neurodegenerative diseases?,"Recommendations on the efficient application of CORAL software (http://www.insilico.eu/coral) to establish quantitative structure-property/activity relationships (QSPRs/QSARs) are provided. The predictive potential of the approach has been demonstrated for QSAR models developed for inhibitor concentrations (negative decimal logarithm of IC50) of derivatives of N-methyl-d-aspartate (NMDA) receptor, leucine-rich repeat kinase 2 (LRRK2), and tropomyosin receptor kinase A (TrkA). The above three protein targets are related to various neurodegenerative diseases such as Alzheimer's and Parkinson's. Each model was checked using several splits of the data for the training and the validation sets. The index of ideality of correlation (IIC) represents a tool to improve the predictive potential for an arbitrary model. However, the use of the IIC should be carried out according to rules, described in this work.",0,
