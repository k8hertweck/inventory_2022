21249531,"The DIADEM data sets: representative light microscopy images of neuronal morphology to advance automation of digital reconstructions. The comprehensive characterization of neuronal morphology requires tracing extensive axonal and dendritic arbors imaged with light microscopy into digital reconstructions. Considerable effort is ongoing to automate this greatly labor-intensive and currently rate-determining process. Experimental data in the form of manually traced digital reconstructions and corresponding image stacks play a vital role in developing increasingly more powerful reconstruction algorithms. The DIADEM challenge (short for DIgital reconstruction of Axonal and DEndritic Morphology) successfully stimulated progress in this area by utilizing six data set collections from different animal species, brain regions, neuron types, and visualization methods. The original research projects that provided these data are representative of the diverse scientific questions addressed in this field. At the same time, these data provide a benchmark for the types of demands automated software must meet to achieve the quality of manual reconstructions while minimizing human involvement. The DIADEM data underwent extensive curation, including quality control, metadata annotation, and format standardization, to focus the challenge on the most substantial technical obstacles. This data set package is now freely released ( http://diademchallenge.org ) to train, test, and aid development of automated reconstruction algorithms.",DIADEM,0.96604323387146,,
21255607,"Aromatic-Aromatic Interactions Database, A(2)ID: an analysis of aromatic Ãâ¬-networks in proteins. The geometrical arrangement of the aromatic rings of phenylalanine, tyrosine, tryptophan and histidine has been analyzed at a database level using the X-ray crystal structure of proteins from PDB in order to find out the aromatic-aromatic (p-p) networks in proteins and to understand how these aromatic rings are connected with each-other in a specific p-p network. A stringent examination of the 7848 proteins indicates that close to 89% of the proteins have occurrence of at least a network of 2p or a higher p-p network. The occurrence of p-p networks in various protein superfamilies based on SCOP, CATH and EC classifiers has also been probed in the present work. In general, we find that multidomain and membrane proteins as well as lyases show a more number of these networks. Analysis of the distribution of angle between planes of two proximal aromatic rings (<U+03D5>) distribution indicates that at a larger cutoff distance (between centroid of two aromatic rings), above 5Ã, C-H<U+22EF>p interactions (T-shaped orientation) are more prevalent, while p-p interactions (stacked orientation) are more prevalent at a smaller cutoff distance. The connectivity patterns of p-p networks propose strong propensity of finding arrangement of aromatic residues as clusters rather than linear arrangement. We have also made a public domain database """"Aromatic-Aromatic Interactions Database"""" (A(2)ID) comprising of all types of p-p networks and their connectivity pattern present in proteins.

21398668,"sc-PDB: a database for identifying variations and multiplicity of 'druggable' binding sites in proteins. Background The sc-PDB database is an annotated archive of druggable binding sites extracted from the Protein Data Bank. It contains all-atoms coordinates for 8166 protein-ligand complexes, chosen for their geometrical and physico-chemical properties. The sc-PDB provides a functional annotation for proteins, a chemical description for ligands and the detailed intermolecular interactions for complexes. The sc-PDB now includes a hierarchical classification of all the binding sites within a functional class. Method The sc-PDB entries were first clustered according to the protein name indifferent of the species. For each cluster, we identified dissimilar sites (e.g. catalytic and allosteric sites of an enzyme). SCOPE AND APPLICATIONS: The classification of sc-PDB targets by binding site diversity was intended to facilitate chemogenomics approaches to drug design. In ligand-based approaches, it avoids comparing ligands that do not share the same binding site. In structure-based approaches, it permits to quantitatively evaluate the diversity of the binding site definition (variations in size, sequence and/or structure).

21624162,"Developing a kidney and urinary pathway knowledge base. Background Chronic renal disease is a global health problem. The identification of suitable biomarkers could facilitate early detection and diagnosis and allow better understanding of the underlying pathology. One of the challenges in meeting this goal is the necessary integration of experimental results from multiple biological levels for further analysis by data mining. Data integration in the life science is still a struggle, and many groups are looking to the benefits promised by the Semantic Web for data integration. Results We present a Semantic Web approach to developing a knowledge base that integrates data from high-throughput experiments on kidney and urine. A specialised KUP ontology is used to tie the various layers together, whilst background knowledge from external databases is incorporated by conversion into RDF. Using SPARQL as a query mechanism, we are able to query for proteins expressed in urine and place these back into the context of genes expressed in regions of the kidney. Conclusions The KUPKB gives KUP biologists the means to ask queries across many resources in order to aggregate knowledge that is necessary for answering biological questions. The Semantic Web technologies we use, together with the background knowledge from the domain's ontologies, allows both rapid conversion and integration of this knowledge base. The KUPKB is still relatively small, but questions remain about scalability, maintenance and availability of the knowledge itself.

Purpose The Quantitative Assay Database (QuAD), http://proteome.moffitt.org/QUAD/, facilitates widespread implementation of quantitative mass spectrometry in cancer biology and clinical research through sharing of methods and reagents for monitoring protein expression and modification. Experimental design Liquid chromatography coupled to multiple reaction monitoring (LC-MRM) mass spectrometry assays are developed using SDS-PAGE fractionated lysates from cancer cell lines. Pathway maps created using GeneGO Metacore provide the biological relationships between proteins and illustrate concepts for multiplexed analysis; each protein can be selected to examine assay development at the protein and peptide levels. Results The coupling of SDS-PAGE and multiple reaction monitoring mass spectrometry screening has been used to detect 876 peptides from 218 cancer-related proteins in model systems including colon, lung, melanoma, leukemias, and myeloma, which has led to the development of 95 quantitative assays including stable-isotope-labeled peptide standards. Methods are published online and peptide standards are made available to the research community. Protein expression measurements for heat shock proteins, including a comparison with ELISA and monitoring response to the HSP90 inhibitor, 17-(dimethylaminoethylamino)-17-demethoxygeldanamycin (17-DMAG), are used to illustrate the components of the QuAD and its potential utility.

Ralstonia solanacearum is a devastating bacterial pathogen that has an unusually wide host range. R. solanacearum, together with Arabidopsis thaliana, has become a model system for studying the molecular basis of plant-pathogen interactions. Protein-protein interactions (PPIs) play a critical role in the infection process, and some PPIs can initiate a plant defense response. However, experimental investigations have rarely addressed such PPIs. Using two computational methods, the interolog and the domain-based methods, we predicted 3,074 potential PPIs between 119 R. solanacearum and 1,442 A. thaliana proteins. Interestingly, we found that the potential pathogen-targeted proteins are more important in the A. thaliana PPI network. To facilitate further studies, all predicted PPI data were compiled into a database server called PPIRA (http://protein.cau.edu.cn/ppira/). We hope that our work will provide new insights for future research addressing the pathogenesis of R. solanacearum.",PPIRA,0.5518913865089417,,
22058129,"DistiLD Database: diseases and traits in linkage disequilibrium blocks. Genome-wide association studies (GWAS) have identified thousands of single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) associated with the risk of hundreds of diseases. However, there is currently no database that enables non-specialists to answer the following simple questions: which SNPs associated with diseases are in linkage disequilibrium (LD) with a gene of interest? Which chromosomal regions have been associated with a given disease, and which are the potentially causal genes in each region? To answer these questions, we use data from the HapMap Project to partition each chromosome into so-called LD blocks, so that SNPs in LD with each other are preferentially in the same block, whereas SNPs not in LD are in different blocks. By projecting SNPs and genes onto LD blocks, the DistiLD database aims to increase usage of existing GWAS results by making it easy to query and visualize disease-associated SNPs and genes in their chromosomal context.

22139934,"Cube-DB: detection of functional divergence in human protein families. Cube-DB is a database of pre-evaluated results for detection of functional divergence in human/vertebrate protein families. The analysis is organized around the nomenclature associated with the human proteins, but based on all currently available vertebrate genomes. Using full genomes enables us, through a mutual-best-hit strategy, to construct comparable taxonomical samples for all paralogues under consideration. Functional specialization is scored on the residue level according to two models of behavior after divergence: heterotachy and homotachy. In the first case, the positions on the protein sequence are scored highly if they are conserved in the reference group of orthologs, and overlap poorly with the residue type choice in the paralogs groups (such positions will also be termed functional determinants). The second model additionally requires conservation within each group of paralogs (functional discriminants). The scoring functions are phylogeny independent, but sensitive to the residue type similarity. The results are presented as a table of per-residue scores, and mapped onto related structure (when available) via browser-embedded visualization tool. They can also be downloaded as a spreadsheet table, and sessions for two additional molecular visualization tools.

22276777,"miRdSNP: a database of disease-associated SNPs and microRNA target sites on 3'UTRs of human genes. Background Single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) can lead to the susceptibility and onset of diseases through their effects on gene expression at the posttranscriptional level. Recent findings indicate that SNPs could create, destroy, or modify the efficiency of miRNA binding to the 3'UTR of a gene, resulting in gene dysregulation. With the rapidly growing number of published disease-associated SNPs (dSNPs), there is a strong need for resources specifically recording dSNPs on the 3'UTRs and their nucleotide distance from miRNA target sites. We present here miRdSNP, a database incorporating three important areas of dSNPs, miRNA target sites, and diseases. Description miRdSNP provides a unique database of dSNPs on the 3'UTRs of human genes manually curated from PubMed. The current release includes 786 dSNP-disease associations for 630 unique dSNPs and 204 disease types. miRdSNP annotates genes with experimentally confirmed targeting by miRNAs and indexes miRNA target sites predicted by TargetScan and PicTar as well as potential miRNA target sites newly generated by dSNPs. A robust web interface and search tools are provided for studying the proximity of miRNA binding sites to dSNPs in relation to human diseases. Searches can be dynamically filtered by gene name, miRBase ID, target prediction algorithm, disease, and any nucleotide distance between dSNPs and miRNA target sites. Results can be viewed at the sequence level showing the annotated locations for miRNA target sites and dSNPs on the entire 3'UTR sequences. The integration of dSNPs with the UCSC Genome browser is also supported. Conclusion miRdSNP provides a comprehensive data source of dSNPs and robust tools for exploring their distance from miRNA target sites on the 3'UTRs of human genes. miRdSNP enables researchers to further explore the molecular mechanism of gene dysregulation for dSNPs at posttranscriptional level. miRdSNP is freely available on the web at http://mirdsnp.ccr.buffalo.edu.",miRdSNP,0.9910256266593933,,
