28961763,psygenet2r: a R/Bioconductor package for the analysis of psychiatric disease genes.,"<h4>Motivation</h4>Psychiatric disorders have a great impact on morbidity and mortality. Genotype-phenotype resources for psychiatric diseases are key to enable the translation of research findings to a better care of patients. PsyGeNET is a knowledge resource on psychiatric diseases and their genes, developed by text mining and curated by domain experts.<h4>Results</h4>We present psygenet2r, an R package that contains a variety of functions for leveraging PsyGeNET database and facilitating its analysis and interpretation. The package offers different types of queries to the database along with variety of analysis and visualization tools, including the study of the anatomical structures in which the genes are expressed and gaining insight of gene's molecular function. Psygenet2r is especially suited for network medicine analysis of psychiatric disorders.<h4>Availability and implementation</h4>The package is implemented in R and is available under MIT license from Bioconductor (http://bioconductor.org/packages/release/bioc/html/psygenet2r.html).<h4>Contact</h4>juanr.gonzalez@isglobal.org or laura.furlong@upf.edu.<h4>Supplementary information</h4>Supplementary data are available at Bioinformatics online.",hji,,0,0,1,0.0,,
31076763,DOGMA: a web server for proteome and transcriptome quality assessment.,"Even in the era of next generation sequencing, in which bioinformatics tools abound, annotating transcriptomes and proteomes remains a challenge. This can have major implications for the reliability of studies based on these datasets. Therefore, quality assessment represents a crucial step prior to downstream analyses on novel transcriptomes and proteomes. DOGMA allows such a quality assessment to be carried out. The data of interest are evaluated based on a comparison with a core set of conserved protein domains and domain arrangements. Depending on the studied species, DOGMA offers precomputed core sets for different phylogenetic clades. We now developed a web server for the DOGMA software, offering a user-friendly, simple to use interface. Additionally, the server provides a graphical representation of the analysis results and their placement in comparison to publicly available data. The server is freely available under https://domainworld-services.uni-muenster.de/dogma/. Additionally, for large scale analyses the software can be downloaded free of charge from https://domainworld.uni-muenster.de.",hji,,0,0,1,0.0,,

31647521,gep2pep: a Bioconductor package for the creation and analysis of pathway-based expression profiles.,"<b>Summary: </b>Pathway-based expression profiles allow for high-level interpretation of transcriptomic data and systematic comparison of dysregulated cellular programs. We have previously demonstrated the efficacy of pathway-based approaches with two different applications: the Drug Set Enrichment Analysis and the Gene2drug analysis. Here we present a software tool that allows to easily convert gene-based profiles to pathway-based profiles and analyze them within the popular R framework. We also provide pre-computed profiles derived from the original Connectivity Map and its next generation release, i.e. the LINCS database.<br><br><b>Availability and implementation: </b>the tool is implemented as the R/Bioconductor package gep2pep and can be freely downloaded from https://bioconductor.org/packages/gep2pep.<br><br><b>Supplementary information: </b>Supplementary data are available at http://dsea.tigem.it/lincs.",hji,,0,0,1,0.0,,
31882993,ShinyGO: a graphical gene-set enrichment tool for animals and plants.,"<h4>Motivation</h4>Gene lists are routinely produced from various omic studies. Enrichment analysis can link these gene lists with underlying molecular pathways and functional categories such as gene ontology (GO) and other databases.<h4>Results</h4>To complement existing tools, we developed ShinyGO based on a large annotation database derived from Ensembl and STRING-db for 59 plant, 256 animal, 115 archeal and 1678 bacterial species. ShinyGO's novel features include graphical visualization of enrichment results and gene characteristics, and application program interface access to KEGG and STRING for the retrieval of pathway diagrams and protein-protein interaction networks. ShinyGO is an intuitive, graphical web application that can help researchers gain actionable insights from gene-sets.<h4>Availability and implementation</h4>http://ge-lab.org/go/.<h4>Supplementary information</h4>Supplementary data are available at Bioinformatics online.",hji,,0,0,1,0.0,,
31926012,LigRMSD: a web server for automatic structure matching and RMSD calculations among identical and similar compounds in protein-ligand docking.,"MOTIVATION:Root mean square deviation (RMSD) is one of the most useful and straightforward features for structural comparison between different conformations of the same molecule. Commonly, protein-ligand docking programs have included some utilities that allow the calculation of this value; however, they only work efficiently when exists a complete atom label equivalence between the evaluated conformations. RESULTS:We present LigRMSD, a free web-server for the automatic matching and RMSD calculations among identical or similar chemical compounds. This server allows the user to submit only a pair of identical or similar molecules or dataset of similar compounds to compare their three-dimensional conformations. AVAILABILITY AND IMPLEMENTATION:LigRMSD can be freely accessed at https://ligrmsd.appsbio.utalca.cl.

32271863,gplas: a comprehensive tool for plasmid analysis using short-read graphs.,"<h4>Summary</h4>Plasmids can horizontally transmit genetic traits, enabling rapid bacterial adaptation to new environments and hosts. Short-read whole-genome sequencing data are often applied to large-scale bacterial comparative genomics projects but the reconstruction of plasmids from these data is facing severe limitations, such as the inability to distinguish plasmids from each other in a bacterial genome. We developed gplas, a new approach to reliably separate plasmid contigs into discrete components using sequence composition, coverage, assembly graph information and network partitioning based on a pruned network of plasmid unitigs. Gplas facilitates the analysis of large numbers of bacterial isolates and allows a detailed analysis of plasmid epidemiology based solely on short-read sequence data.<h4>Availability and implementation</h4>Gplas is written in R, Bash and uses a Snakemake pipeline as a workflow management system. Gplas is available under the GNU General Public License v3.0 at https://gitlab.com/sirarredondo/gplas.git.<h4>Supplementary information</h4>Supplementary data are available at Bioinformatics online.",hji,,0,0,1,0.0,,
32321166,APAlyzer: a bioinformatics package for analysis of alternative polyadenylation isoforms.,"<h4>Summary</h4>Most eukaryotic genes produce alternative polyadenylation (APA) isoforms. APA is dynamically regulated under different growth and differentiation conditions. Here, we present a bioinformatics package, named APAlyzer, for examining 3'UTR APA, intronic APA and gene expression changes using RNA-seq data and annotated polyadenylation sites in the PolyA_DB database. Using APAlyzer and data from the GTEx database, we present APA profiles across human tissues.<h4>Availability and implementation</h4>APAlyzer is freely available at https://bioconductor.org/packages/release/bioc/html/APAlyzer.html as an R/Bioconductor package.<h4>Supplementary information</h4>Supplementary data are available at Bioinformatics online.",hji,,0,0,1,0.0,,
32394182,LexOPS: An R package and user interface for the controlled generation of word stimuli.,"LexOPS is an R package and user interface designed to facilitate the generation of word stimuli for use in research. Notably, the tool permits the generation of suitably controlled word lists for any user-specified factorial design and can be adapted for use with any language. It features an intuitive graphical user interface, including the visualization of both the distributions within and relationships among variables of interest. An inbuilt database of English words is also provided, including a range of lexical variables commonly used in psycholinguistic research. This article introduces LexOPS, outlining the features of the package and detailing the sources of the inbuilt dataset. We also report a validation analysis, showing that, in comparison to stimuli of existing studies, stimuli optimized with LexOPS generally demonstrate greater constraint and consistency in variable manipulation and control. Current instructions for installing and using LexOPS are available at https://JackEdTaylor.github.io/LexOPSdocs/ .",hji,,0,0,1,0.0,,also linguistics
