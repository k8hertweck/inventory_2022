28917032,CFS MATLAB toolbox: An experiment builder for continuous flash suppression (CFS) task.,"CFS toolbox is an open-source collection of MATLAB functions that utilizes PsychToolbox-3 (PTB-3). It is designed to allow a researcher to create and run continuous flash suppression experiments using a variety of experimental parameters (i.e., stimulus types and locations, noise characteristics, and experiment window settings). In a CFS experiment, one of the eyes at a time is presented with a dynamically changing noise pattern, while the other eye is concurrently presented with a static target stimulus, such as a Gabor patch. Due to the strong interocular suppression created by the dominant noise pattern mask, the target stimulus is rendered invisible for an extended duration. Very little knowledge of MATLAB is required for using the toolbox; experiments are generated by modifying csv files with the required parameters, and result data are output to text files for further analysis. The open-source code is available on the project page under a Creative Commons License ( http://www.mikkonuutinen.arkku.net/CFS_toolbox/ and https://bitbucket.org/mikkonuutinen/cfs_toolbox ).",hji,,0,0,1,0.0,,
29036410,SPRINT: an SNP-free toolkit for identifying RNA editing sites.,"<h4>Motivation</h4>RNA editing generates post-transcriptional sequence alterations. Detection of RNA editing sites (RESs) typically requires the filtering of SNVs called from RNA-seq data using an SNP database, an obstacle that is difficult to overcome for most organisms.<h4>Results</h4>Here, we present a novel method named SPRINT that identifies RESs without the need to filter out SNPs. SPRINT also integrates the detection of hyper RESs from remapped reads, and has been fully automated to any RNA-seq data with reference genome sequence available. We have rigorously validated SPRINT's effectiveness in detecting RESs using RNA-seq data of samples in which genes encoding RNA editing enzymes are knock down or over-expressed, and have also demonstrated its superiority over current methods. We have applied SPRINT to investigate RNA editing across tissues and species, and also in the development of mouse embryonic central nervous system. A web resource (http://sprint.tianlab.cn) of RESs identified by SPRINT has been constructed.<h4>Availability and implementation</h4>The software and related data are available at http://sprint.tianlab.cn.<h4>Contact</h4>weidong.tian@fudan.edu.cn.<h4>Supplementary information</h4>Supplementary data are available at Bioinformatics online.",hji,,0,0,1,0.0,,

29539190,"MSeqDR mvTool: A mitochondrial DNA Web and API resource for comprehensive variant annotation, universal nomenclature collation, and reference genome conversion.","Accurate mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) variant annotation is essential for the clinical diagnosis of diverse human diseases. Substantial challenges to this process include the inconsistency in mtDNA nomenclatures, the existence of multiple reference genomes, and a lack of reference population frequency data. Clinicians need a simple bioinformatics tool that is user-friendly, and bioinformaticians need a powerful informatics resource for programmatic usage. Here, we report the development and functionality of the MSeqDR mtDNA Variant Tool set (mvTool), a one-stop mtDNA variant annotation and analysis Web service. mvTool is built upon the MSeqDR infrastructure (https://mseqdr.org), with contributions of expert curated data from MITOMAP (https://www.mitomap.org) and HmtDB (https://www.hmtdb.uniba.it/hmdb). mvTool supports all mtDNA nomenclatures, converts variants to standard rCRS- and HGVS-based nomenclatures, and annotates novel mtDNA variants. Besides generic annotations from dbNSFP and Variant Effect Predictor (VEP), mvTool provides allele frequencies in more than 47,000 germline mitogenomes, and disease and pathogenicity classifications from MSeqDR, Mitomap, HmtDB and ClinVar (Landrum et al., 2013). mvTools also provides mtDNA somatic variants annotations. ""mvTool API"" is implemented for programmatic access using inputs in VCF, HGVS, or classical mtDNA variant nomenclatures.

BUSCA combines methods for identifying signal and transit peptides (DeepSig and TPpred3), GPI-anchors (PredGPI) and transmembrane domains (ENSEMBLE3.0 and BetAware) with tools for discriminating subcellular localization of both globular and membrane proteins (BaCelLo, MemLoci and SChloro). Outcomes from the different tools are processed and integrated for annotating subcellular localization of both eukaryotic and bacterial protein sequences. We benchmark BUSCA against protein targets derived from recent CAFA experiments and other specific data sets, reporting performance at the state-of-the-art. BUSCA scores better than all other evaluated methods on 2732 targets from CAFA2, with a F1 value equal to 0.49 and among the best methods when predicting targets from CAFA3.

29721311,Gene Unprediction with Spurio: A tool to identify spurious protein sequences.,"We now have access to the sequences of tens of millions of proteins. These protein sequences are essential for modern molecular biology and computational biology. The vast majority of protein sequences are derived from gene prediction tools and have no experimental supporting evidence for their translation.  Despite the increasing accuracy of gene prediction tools there likely exists a large number of spurious protein predictions in the sequence databases.  We have developed the Spurio tool to help identify spurious protein predictions in prokaryotes.  Spurio searches the query protein sequence against a prokaryotic nucleotide database using tblastn and identifies homologous sequences. The tblastn matches are used to score the query sequence's likelihood of being a spurious protein prediction using a Gaussian process model. The most informative feature is the appearance of stop codons within the presumed translation of homologous DNA sequences. Benchmarking shows that the Spurio tool is able to distinguish spurious from true proteins. However, transposon proteins are prone to be predicted as spurious because of the frequency of degraded homologs found in the DNA sequence databases. Our initial experiments suggest that less than 1% of the proteins in the UniProtKB sequence database are likely to be spurious and that Spurio is able to identify over 60 times more spurious proteins than the AntiFam resource.

30222561,Large-Scale Study of Perceptual Video Quality.,"The great variations of videographic skills in videography, camera designs, compression and processing protocols, communication and bandwidth environments, and displays leads to an enormous variety of video impairments. Current noreference (NR) video quality models are unable to handle this diversity of distortions. This is true in part because available video quality assessment databases contain very limited content, fixed resolutions, were captured using a small number of camera devices by a few videographers and have been subjected to a modest number of distortions. As such, these databases fail to adequately represent real world videos, which contain very different kinds of content obtained under highly diverse imaging conditions and are subject to authentic, complex and often commingled distortions that are difficult or impossible to simulate. As a result, NR video quality predictors tested on real-world video data often perform poorly. Towards advancing NR video quality prediction, we have constructed a largescale video quality assessment database containing 585 videos of unique content, captured by a large number of users, with wide ranges of levels of complex, authentic distortions. We collected a large number of subjective video quality scores via crowdsourcing. A total of 4776 unique participants took part in the study, yielding more than 205000 opinion scores, resulting in an average of 240 recorded human opinions per video. We demonstrate the value of the new resource, which we call the LIVE Video Quality Challenge Database (LIVE-VQC for short), by conducting a comparison of leading NR video quality predictors on it. This study is the largest video quality assessment study ever conducted along several key dimensions: number of unique contents, capture devices, distortion types and combinations of distortions, study participants, and recorded subjective scores.

30261835,Sequence homology in eukaryotes (SHOE): interactive visual tool for promoter analysis.,"<h4>Background</h4>Microarray and DNA-sequencing based technologies continue to produce enormous amounts of data on gene expression. This data has great potential to illuminate our understanding of biology and medicine, but the data alone is of limited value without computational tools to allow human investigators to visualize and interpret it in the context of their problem of interest.<h4>Results</h4>We created a web server called SHOE that provides an interactive, visual presentation of the available evidence of transcriptional regulation and gene co-expression to facilitate its exploration and interpretation. SHOE predicts the likely transcription factor binding sites in orthologous promoters of humans, mice, and rats using the combined information of 1) transcription factor binding preferences (position-specific scoring matrix (PSSM) libraries such as Transfac32, Jaspar, HOCOMOCO, ChIP-seq, SELEX, PBM, and iPS-reprogramming factor), 2) evolutionary conservation of putative binding sites in orthologous promoters, and 3) co-expression tendencies of gene pairs based on 1,714 normal human cells selected from the Gene Expression Omnibus Database.<h4>Conclusion</h4>SHOE enables users to explore potential interactions between transcription factors and target genes via multiple data views, discover transcription factor binding motifs on top of gene co-expression, and visualize genes as a network of gene and transcription factors on its native gadget GeneViz, the CellDesigner pathway analyzer, and the Reactome database to search the pathways involved. As we demonstrate here when using the CREB1 and Nf-Œ∫B datasets, SHOE can reliably identify experimentally verified interactions and predict plausible novel ones, yielding new biological insights into the gene regulatory mechanisms involved. SHOE comes with a manual describing how to run it on a local PC or via the Garuda platform ( www.garuda-alliance.org ), where it joins other popular gadgets such as the CellDesigner pathway analyzer and the Reactome database, as part of analysis workflows to meet the growing needs of molecular biologists and medical researchers.

31106379,Drug ReposER: a web server for predicting similar amino acid arrangements to known drug binding interfaces for potential drug repositioning.,"A common drug repositioning strategy is the re-application of an existing drug to address alternative targets. A crucial aspect to enable such repurposing is that the drug's binding site on the original target is similar to that on the alternative target. Based on the assumption that proteins with similar binding sites may bind to similar drugs, the 3D substructure similarity data can be used to identify similar sites in other proteins that are not known targets. The Drug ReposER (DRug REPOSitioning Exploration Resource) web server is designed to identify potential targets for drug repurposing based on sub-structural similarity to the binding interfaces of known drug binding sites. The application has pre-computed amino acid arrangements from protein structures in the Protein Data Bank that are similar to the 3D arrangements of known drug binding sites thus allowing users to explore them as alternative targets. Users can annotate new structures for sites that are similarly arranged to the residues found in known drug binding interfaces.

The probabilistic interaction network of evidence (PINE) algorithm for automated assignment of backbone and side chain chemical shifts utilizes a Bayesian probabilistic network model that analyzes sequence data and peak lists from multiple NMR experiments.

31318409,PTM-Logo: a program for generation of sequence logos based on position-specific background amino-acid probabilities.,"<h4>Summary</h4>Identification of the amino-acid motifs in proteins that are targeted for post-translational modifications (PTMs) is of great importance in understanding regulatory networks. Information about targeted motifs can be derived from mass spectrometry data that identify peptides containing specific PTMs such as phosphorylation, ubiquitylation and acetylation. Comparison of input data against a standardized 'background' set allows identification of over- and under-represented amino acids surrounding the modified site. Conventionally, calculation of targeted motifs assumes a random background distribution of amino acids surrounding the modified position. However, we show that probabilities of amino acids depend on (i) the type of the modification and (ii) their positions relative to the modified site. Thus, software that identifies such over- and under-represented amino acids should make appropriate adjustments for these effects. Here we present a new program, PTM-Logo, that generates representations of these amino acid preferences ('logos') based on position-specific amino-acid probability backgrounds calculated either from user-input data or curated databases.<h4>Availability and implementation</h4>PTM-Logo is freely available online at http://sysbio.chula.ac.th/PTMLogo/ or https://hpcwebapps.cit.nih.gov/PTMLogo/.<h4>Supplementary information</h4>Supplementary data are available at Bioinformatics online.",hji,,0,0,1,0.0,,

Photosynthetic organisms, and plants especially, have established complex programs that coordinate physiological, metabolic and developmental processes with the changing light. The diurnal regulation of the underlying transcriptional processes is observed when groups of functionally related genes (gene modules) are expressed at a specific time of the day. However, studying the diurnal regulation of these gene modules in the plant kingdom was hampered by the large amount of data required for the analyses. To meet this need, we used gene expression data from 17 diurnal studies spanning the whole Archaeplastida kingdom (Plantae kingdom in the broad sense) to make an online diurnal database. We have equipped the database with tools that allow user-friendly cross-species comparisons of gene expression profiles, entire co-expression networks, co-expressed clusters (involved in specific biological processes), time-specific gene expression and others. We exemplify how these tools can be used by studying three important biological questions: (i) the evolution of cell division, (ii) the diurnal control of gene modules in algae and (iii) the conservation of diurnally controlled modules across species.

The 893 accessions were collected worldwide, mainly Asia. Genetic variation and population structure among the 893 eggplant accessions were characterized. The genetic diversity of the Asian accessions, especially the South Asian and Southeast Asian accessions, forming the center of diversity in eggplant, was higher than that of the other regions. The resulting core collection, World Eggplant Core (WEC) collection consisted of 100 accessions basically collected from the high genetic diversity countries. Based on the results of the cluster and STRUCTURE analyses with SNP genotypes, the WEC collection was divided into four clusters (S1-S4). Each cluster corresponds to a geographical group as below, S1; the European, American and African countries, S2; the East Asian countries, S3; the Southeast Asian countries, S4; the South Asian and Southeast Asian countries. The genotype and phenotype data of the WEC collection are available from the VegMarks database (https://vegmarks.nivot.affrc.go.jp/resource/), and seed samples are available from the NARO Genebank (https://www.gene.affrc.go.jp/databases-core_collections.php).",hji,,0,0,1,0.0,,not descriptive of resource
31664036,Prenatal hypoxia-induced epigenomic and transcriptomic reprogramming in rat fetal and adult offspring hearts.,"The molecular mechanism of antenatal hypoxia impacting on fetal heart development and elevated risk of heart disease of adult offspring is poorly understood. We present a dataset integrating DNA methylome and transcriptome analyses of antenatal hypoxia affecting rat fetal and adult offspring hearts to understand hypoxia-mediated epigenomic reprogramming of the heart development. We showed that antenatal hypoxia not only induced DNA methylomic and transcriptomic changes in the fetal hearts, but also had a delayed and lasting effect on the adult offspring hearts. Of interest, antenatal hypoxia induced opposite changes in DNA methylation patterns in fetal and adult hearts, with a hypermethylation in the fetus and a hypomethylation in the adult. An extensive preprocessing, quality assessment, and downstream data analyses were performed on the genomic dataset so that the research community may take advantage of the public resource. These dataset could be exploited as a comprehensive resource for understanding fetal hypoxia-mediated epigenetic reprogramming in the heart development and further developmental programming of heart vulnerability to disease later in life.Figshare doi: https://doi.org/10.6084/m9.figshare.9948572.",hji,,0,0,1,0.0,,

The candidate pathways identified from C. elegans study were also confirmed using vertebrate model, zebrafish, Danio rerio and human relevance was then inferred using Comparative Toxicogenomics Database (CTD) analysis. Prior to evaluating the toxicity, label-free Raman mapping was conducted to investigate whether or not the organisms could uptake HDPE. C. elegans transcription factor RNAi screening results showed that the nucleotide excision repair (NER) and transforming growth factor-beta (TGF-Œ≤) signaling pathways were significantly associated with HDPE exposure, which was also confirmed in zebrafish model. Gene-disease interaction analysis using the CTD revealed the possible human health implications of microplastics. Finally, based on this finding, related AOPs were identified from AOP Wiki (http://aopwiki.org), which are ""Peroxisome proliferator-activated receptors Œ≥ inactivation leading to lung fibrosis"" and ""AFB1: Mutagenic Mode-of-Action leading to Hepatocellular Carcinoma"".

Significant efforts have been made to curate gene:disease associations both in academic research and commercial genetic testing laboratory settings. However, many of these valuable resources exist as islands and must be used independently, generating static, single-resource gene:disease association lists. Here we describe genepanel.iobio (https://genepanel.iobio.io) an easy to use, free and open-source web tool for generating disease- and phenotype-associated gene lists from multiple gene:disease association resources, including the NCBI Genetic Testing Registry (GTR), Phenolyzer, and the Human Phenotype Ontology (HPO). We demonstrate the utility of genepanel.iobio by applying it to complex, rare and undiagnosed disease cases that had reached a diagnostic conclusion. We find that genepanel.iobio is able to correctly prioritize the gene containing the diagnostic variant in roughly half of these challenging cases. Importantly, each component resource contributed diagnostic value, showing the benefits of this aggregate approach. We expect genepanel.iobio will improve the ease and diagnostic value of generating gene:disease association lists for genetic test ordering and whole genome or exome sequencing variant prioritization.",hji,,0,0,1,0.0,,
31830251,FFLtool: a web server for transcription factor and miRNA feed forward loop analysis in human.,"SUMMARY:Transcription factors (TFs) and microRNAs (miRNAs) are two kinds of important regulators for transcriptional and post-transcriptional regulations. Understanding cross-talks between the two regulators and their targets is critical to reveal complex molecular regulatory mechanisms. Here, we developed FFLtool, a web server for detecting potential feed forward loop (FFL) of TF-miRNA-target regulation in human. In FFLtool, we integrated comprehensive regulations of TF-target and miRNA-target, and developed two functional modules: (i) The 'FFL Analysis' module can detect potential FFLs and internal regulatory networks in a user-defined gene set. FFLtool also provides three levels of evidence to illustrate the reliability for each FFL and enrichment functions for co-target genes of the same TF and miRNA; (ii) The 'Browse FFLs' module displays FFLs comprised of differentially or specifically expressed TFs and miRNAs and their target genes in cancers.

However, limited intra-individual variability is a precondition for targeted dosing and the diagnosis of SI.<h4>Methods</h4>In the AIEOP-BFM acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) 2009 trial, 2771 children with ALL were included and underwent ASNase-TDM in a central laboratory in M√ºnster. Two biweekly administrations of pegylated ASNase during induction and a third dose during reinduction or the high-risk block, which was administered several weeks later, were monitored. We calculated (1) the incidence of SI; and (2) the predictivity of SI for SI after the subsequent administration. ASNase activities monitored during induction were categorized into percentiles at the respective sampling time points. These percentiles were used to calculate the intra-individual range of percentiles as a surrogate for intrapatient variability and to evaluate the predictivity of ASNase activity for the subsequent administration.<h4>Results</h4>The overall incidence of SI was low (4.9%). The positive predictive value of SI identified by one sample was ‚â§21%. Confirmation of SI by a second sample indicated a high positive predictive value of 100% for biweekly administrations, but not for administration more than 17 weeks later. Sampling and/or documentation errors were risks for misdiagnosis of SI. High intra-individual variability in ASNase activities, with ranges of percentiles over more than 2 quartiles and low predictivity, was observed in approximately 25% of the patients. These patients were likely to fail dose individualization based on TDM data.<h4>Conclusions</h4>To use TDM as a basis for clinical decisions, standardized clinical procedures are required and high intra-individual variability should be taken into account.

Using whole-genome bisulfite sequencing (WGBS) technology, methylated cytosine sites can be revealed at the single nucleotide level. However, the WGBS data analysis process is usually complicated and challenging.<h4>Results</h4>To alleviate the associated difficulties, we integrated the WGBS data processing steps and downstream analysis into a two-phase approach. First, we set up the required tools in Galaxy and developed workflows to calculate the methylation level from raw WGBS data and generate a methylation status summary, the mtable.

Differentially expressed genes (DEGs) were defined as genes that appeared at least three times with p values <0.05 and a fold change of ‚â•50% (|log2FC| ‚â• 0.58). Hub genes were identified by evaluating the following parameters using a protein-protein interaction network: node degrees, betweenness, and eigenfactor scores. Hub genes and the top-40 DEGs by |log2FC| were used to generate a Venn diagram, and key genes were identified. Functional and pathway enrichment analysis was performed using the Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) databases. Information on ovarian cancer patients derived from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) database was analyzed, and the effect of topotecan on the protein expression was examined by Western blotting.<h4>Results</h4>Eleven topotecan signatures were downloaded, and 65 upregulated and 87 downregulated DEGs were identified. Twenty-one hub genes were identified. We identified eight key genes as upregulated genes, including NFKBIA, IKBKB, GADD45A, CDKN1A, and HIST2H2BE, while EZH2, CDC20, and CDK7 were identified as downregulated genes, which play critical roles in the cell cycle and carcinogenesis in KEGG analysis. In the TCGA analysis, the CDKN1A+/EZH2- group had the longest median survival, while the CDKN1A-/EZH2+ group had the shortest median survival. Topotecan-treated murine ovarian (MOSEC), colorectal (CT26), and lung (LLC) cancer cell lines displayed upregulated CDKN1A encoding p21 and downregulated Ezh2.<h4>Conclusion</h4>Using publicly accessible bioinformatics tools, we evaluated key genes and pathways related to topotecan and examined the key genes using the TCGA database and in vitro studies.",hji,,0,0,1,0.0,,not descriptive of resource
32270255,Major depressive disorder and cardiometabolic diseases: a bidirectional Mendelian randomisation study.,"AIMS/HYPOTHESIS:Observational studies have shown a bidirectional association between major depressive disorder (MDD) and cardiometabolic diseases. We conducted a two-sample bidirectional Mendelian randomisation (MR) study to assess the causal associations of MDD with type 2 diabetes, coronary artery disease (CAD) and heart failure and vice versa. METHODS:We extracted summary-level data for MDD, type 2 diabetes, CAD and heart failure from corresponding published large genome-wide association studies of individuals mainly of European-descent. In total, 96 SNPs for MDD, 202 SNPs for type 2 diabetes, 44 SNPs for CAD and 12 SNPs for heart failure were proposed as instrumental variables at the genome-wide significance level (p‚Äâ<‚Äâ5‚Äâ√ó‚Äâ10-8). The random-effects inverse-variance weighted method was used for the main analyses. RESULTS:Genetic liability to MDD was significantly associated with type 2 diabetes and CAD at the Bonferroni-corrected significance level. The ORs of type 2 diabetes and CAD were respectively 1.26 (95% CI 1.10, 1.43; p‚Äâ=‚Äâ6‚Äâ√ó‚Äâ10-4) and 1.16 (95% CI 1.05, 1.29; p‚Äâ=‚Äâ0.0047) per one-unit increase in loge odds of MDD. There was a suggestive association between MDD and heart failure (OR 1.11 [95% CI 1.01, 1.21]; p‚Äâ=‚Äâ0.033). We found limited evidence supporting causal effects of cardiometabolic diseases on MDD risk in the reverse MR analyses. CONCLUSIONS/INTERPRETATION:The present study strengthened the evidence that MDD is a potential risk factor for type 2 diabetes and CAD. Whether MDD is causally related to heart failure needs further study.

32271876,MODifieR: an Ensemble R Package for Inference of Disease Modules from Transcriptomics Networks.,"<h4>Motivation</h4>Complex diseases are due to the dense interactions of many disease-associated factors that dysregulate genes that in turn form the so-called disease modules, which have shown to be a powerful concept for understanding pathological mechanisms. There exist many disease module inference methods that rely on somewhat different assumptions, but there is still no gold standard or best-performing method. Hence, there is a need for combining these methods to generate robust disease modules.<h4>Results</h4>We developed MODule IdentiFIER (MODifieR), an ensemble R package of nine disease module inference methods from transcriptomics networks. MODifieR uses standardized input and output allowing the possibility to combine individual modules generated from these methods into more robust disease-specific modules, contributing to a better understanding of complex diseases.<h4>Availability and implementation</h4>MODifieR is available under the GNU GPL license and can be freely downloaded from https://gitlab.com/Gustafsson-lab/MODifieR and as a Docker image from https://hub.docker.com/r/ddeweerd/modifier.<h4>Supplementary information</h4>Supplementary data are available at Bioinformatics online.",hji,,0,0,1,0.0,,

The initial release of rMAPS focused only on the most common alternative splicing event, skipped exon or exon skipping. However, there was a high demand for the analysis of other major types of alternative splicing events, especially for retained intron events since this is the most common type of alternative splicing in plants, such as Arabidopsis thaliana. Here, we expanded the implementation of rMAPS2 to facilitate analyses for all five major types of alternative splicing events: skipped exon, mutually exclusive exons, alternative 5' splice site, alternative 3' splice site and retained intron. In addition, by employing multi-threading, rMAPS2 has vastly improved the user experience with significant reductions in running time, ‚àº3.5 min for the analysis of all five major alternative splicing types at once.",hji,,0,0,1,0.0,,

32299846,Pilot Study of Return of Genetic Results to Patients in Adult Nephrology.,"<h4>Background and objectives</h4>Actionable genetic findings have implications for care of patients with kidney disease, and genetic testing is an emerging tool in nephrology practice. However, there are scarce data regarding best practices for return of results and clinical application of actionable genetic findings for kidney patients.<h4>Design, setting, participants, & measurements</h4>We developed a return of results workflow in collaborations with clinicians for the retrospective recontact of adult nephrology patients who had been recruited into a biobank research study for exome sequencing and were identified to have medically actionable genetic findings.<h4>Results</h4>Using this workflow, we attempted to recontact a diverse pilot cohort of 104 nephrology research participants with actionable genetic findings, encompassing 34 different monogenic etiologies of nephropathy and five single-gene disorders recommended by the American College of Medical Genetics and Genomics for return as medically actionable secondary findings. We successfully recontacted 64 (62%) participants and returned results to 41 (39%) individuals. In each case, the genetic diagnosis had meaningful implications for the patients' nephrology care. Through implementation efforts and qualitative interviews with providers, we identified over 20 key challenges associated with returning results to study participants, and found that physician knowledge gaps in genomics was a recurrent theme. We iteratively addressed these challenges to yield an optimized workflow, which included standardized consultation notes with tailored management recommendations, monthly educational conferences on core topics in genomics, and a curated list of expert clinicians for patients requiring extranephrologic referrals.<h4>Conclusions</h4>Developing the infrastructure to support return of genetic results in nephrology was resource-intensive, but presented potential opportunities for improving patient care.<h4>Podcast</h4>This article contains a podcast at https://www.asn-online.org/media/podcast/CJASN/2020_04_16_12481019.mp3.",hji,,0,0,1,0.0,,podcast

In May 2012, the Task Force for Children's Surgical Care, an ad hoc multidisciplinary group comprising physicians representing specialties relevant to pediatric perioperative care, was convened to generate recommendations to optimize the delivery of children's surgical care. This group generated a white paper detailing the consensus opinions of the involved experts. Following these initial recommendations, the American College of Surgeons (ACS), Children's Hospital Association, and Task Force for Children's Surgical Care, with input from all related perioperative specialties, developed and published specific and detailed resource and quality standards designed to improve children's surgical care (https://www.facs.org/quality-programs/childrens-surgery/childrens-surgery-verification).

32324845,alona: a web server for single-cell RNA-seq analysis.,"<h4>Summary</h4>Single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) is a technology to measure gene expression in single cells. It has enabled discovery of new cell types and established cell type atlases of tissues and organs. The widespread adoption of scRNA-seq has created a need for user-friendly software for data analysis. We have developed a web server, alona that incorporates several of the most popular single-cell analysis algorithms into a flexible pipeline. alona can perform quality filtering, normalization, batch correction, clustering, cell type annotation and differential gene expression analysis. Data are visualized in the web browser using an interface based on JavaScript, allowing the user to query genes of interest and visualize the cluster structure. alona accepts a compressed gene expression matrix and identifies cell clusters with a graph-based clustering strategy. Cell types are identified from a comprehensive collection of marker genes or by specifying a custom set of marker genes.<h4>Availability and implementation</h4>The service runs at https://alona.panglaodb.se and the Python package can be downloaded from https://oscar-franzen.github.io/adobo/.<h4>Supplementary information</h4>Supplementary data are available at Bioinformatics online.",hji,,0,0,1,0.0,,

Of all the parameters evaluated, our results demonstrated no statistically significant relation between preoperative DJ stenting and the presence of RFs (œá2 (1)‚Äâ=‚Äâ158.418; p‚Äâ=‚Äâ0.099). RFs were significantly higher in patients treated with UAS (82 patients, 29.3%) during the procedure compared to the cases who did not receive UAS (194 patients, 23.3%) (œá2 (1)‚Äâ=‚Äâ3.999; p‚Äâ=‚Äâ0.046). The mean period for a secondary intervention after RIRS was 28.39 (¬±‚Äâ12.52) days. Regarding the procedures applied for RF removal, re-RIRS was the most commonly performed approach (56%).<h4>Conclusions</h4>Despite the reported safe and successful outcomes, the incidence of RFs is higher, after the RIRS procedure particularly in cases with relatively larger calculi. Such cases need to be followed in a close manner and although a second flexible ureteroscopy is the treatment of choice for fragment removal in the majority of these patients, shock wave lithotripsy and percutaneous nephrolithotomy may also be preferred in selected cases.",hji,,0,0,1,0.0,,clinical; not descriptive of resource
32367143,"Not just a research method: If used with caution, can job-exposure matrices be a useful tool in the practice of occupational medicine and public health?","The recent editorial by Dr Susan Peters ""Although a valuable method in occupational epidemiology, job-exposure matrices are no magic fix"" ably describes the strengths and limitations of job-exposure matrix (JEM) approaches in occupational epidemiology research (1). In addition to their use in research, we would like to add that JEM may also be of use in compensation and surveillance efforts in occupational health. JEM could assist the compensation process by supporting the assessment of relevant exposures related to specific health conditions (2). The potential usefulness of a JEM as a decision tool for compensation of work-related musculoskeletal disorders has been examined (3). Because occupational diseases are often under-recognized, another practical application is using a JEM to screen for occupational exposures as part of health surveillance. Use of JEM to screen for asbestos and wood dust exposure in the clinical setting has shown promising results (4-6). By summarizing multiple exposures at a job level (7), JEM may also assist policy-makers in setting priorities for hazards and controls at work, as well as occupational practitioners to target prevention efforts and direct the conduct of more precise exposure measures to particular jobs. Sharing JEM across different countries may be useful in providing estimates of exposures across larger populations to calculate global burden of disease related to occupational exposure. The JEMINI (JEM InterNatIonal) initiative was launched to explore the possibility of developing international JEM that could be used across countries (8). Beginning with physical (biomechanical) exposures, this open group has started homogenizing job coding systems and comparing some available JEM. Estimating differences in the level of exposure between countries will require much more work, without guaranteed success. As Peters mentioned, many limitations exist in the use of JEM. Users of JEM must consider the source of exposure data - expert assessments, data collected from individual workers, or environmental sampling. The coding of occupations is time consuming and can introduce error (9), and more testing of and comparison with automated job coding systems is needed (10). JEM reflect an ""average"" level of exposure within a job at the expense of individual variation. At population level, JEM can offer a useful estimate of exposures. If used at an individual level in a clinical or compensation setting, JEM cannot replace the professionals involved in exposure assessment but may help them focus their action more effectively on complex situations that require their expertise. In conclusion, these JEM developed for research might also be used as a public health tool, provided that their limitations are properly taken into account. References 1. Peters S.

Protein Structure Graphs (PSGs) are computed on a single structure, whereas information on system dynamics is supplied by ENM-NMA. The approach was implemented in a webserver (webPSN), which was significantly updated herein. The webserver now handles both proteins and nucleic acids and relies on an internal upgradable database of network parameters for ions and small molecules in all PDB structures. Apart from the radical restyle of the server and some changes in the calculation setup, other major novelties concern the possibility to: a) compute the differences in nodes, links, and communication pathways between two structures (i.e. network difference) and b) infer links, hubs, communities, and metapaths from consensus networks computed on a number of structures. These new features are useful to identify commonalties and differences between two different functional states of the same system or structural-communication signatures in homologous or analogous systems. The output analysis relies on 3D-representations, interactive tables and graphs, also available for download.

Past studies have identified anti-CRISPRs in several model phage genomes, but a challenge exists to comprehensively screen for anti-CRISPRs accurately and efficiently from genome and metagenome sequence data. Here, we have developed an ensemble learning based predictor, PaCRISPR, to accurately identify anti-CRISPRs from protein datasets derived from genome and metagenome sequencing projects. PaCRISPR employs different types of feature recognition united within an ensemble framework. Extensive cross-validation and independent tests show that PaCRISPR achieves a significantly more accurate performance compared with homology-based baseline predictors and an existing toolkit. The performance of PaCRISPR was further validated in discovering anti-CRISPRs that were not part of the training for PaCRISPR, but which were recently demonstrated to function as anti-CRISPRs for phage infections.

Despite significant efforts and the evolution of quantitative structure-activity relationship as well as machine learning-based models for computationally predicting molecule bioactivity, there is an unmet need for efficient and reliable methods for identifying biologically active compounds against Mycobacterium that are also safe for humans. Here we developed mycoCSM, a graph-based signature approach to rapidly identify compounds likely to be active against bacteria from the genus Mycobacterium, or against specific Mycobacteria species. mycoCSM was trained and validated on eight organism-specific and for the first time a general Mycobacteria data set, achieving correlation coefficients of up to 0.89 on cross-validation and 0.88 on independent blind tests, when predicting bioactivity in terms of minimum inhibitory concentration. In addition, we also developed a predictor to identify those compounds likely to penetrate in necrotic tuberculosis foci, which achieved a correlation coefficient of 0.75.

32626907,Comments on a recent case-control study of malignant mesothelioma of the pericardium and the tunica vaginalis testis.,"As the first case-control study of malignant mesothelioma of the pericardium and the tunica vaginalis testis (mTVT), the paper by Marinaccio et al (1) is potentially an important epidemiologic contribution. A careful review of the paper, however, raises a number of methodological issues. Any case-control study can be viewed as being nested within a conceptual cohort, with controls being sampled from the at-risk cohort as cases arise over time. This view of case-control studies leads to the concept of incidence-density sampling of controls (eg, 2, 3). For Marinaccio et al (1) this would mean that, as cases were registered over the study period, each would be matched to an individual control or set of controls of the same gender, age, and region of the country (since asbestos exposure varies by time and region [4]). For example, if a case were 50 years old in 1995, then any matched control should be close to age 50 in 1995 and of the same gender and from the same region as the case. Matching for age in this fashion automatically results in matching for year of birth, which is essential in this context because birth-cohort effects are determinants of asbestos exposure and mesothelioma incidence (eg, 5-8). If Marinaccio et al (1) used this scheme for age-matching, one would expect to see similar distributions of cases (table 1) and controls (table S3 in the supplemental material) by period of birth. Among males, however, the distributions of mesothelioma cases (whether pericardial or mTVT) and controls by period of birth are clearly different (P<0.001). Among females, the distributions of cases of pericardial mesothelioma and controls by birth year are less dissimilar (P‚âà0.05). Thus, the female cases of pericardial mesothelioma are better matched to controls on year of birth than are male cases of either mTVT or pericardial mesothelioma. We note also that the distributions of male and female controls by year of birth are distinctly different (P<0.002), whereas the birth-year distributions of cases of mesothelioma by site and gender are not (P‚âà0.8). In the Marinaccio et al (1) sensitivity analysis restricted to subjects born before 1950, the distributions of cases and controls by period of birth remain significantly different. Therefore, based on the reported evidence, cases and controls were not matched on birth cohort, thereby possibly biasing the results. Similarly, bias may result from the lack of matching on geographic region; while cases were registered from across Italy, controls were selected from only six regions. Although a sensitivity analysis restricted cases and controls to those from only the six regions, a comparison of tables S1 and S3 indicates that the regional distribution of controls is different from that of person-time observed; that is, the controls do not appear to be representative of the underlying population at risk by region. The second major issue of concern has to do with ascertainment of asbestos exposure. Information on exposure for the cases was presumably obtained at the time of registration. The two sets of controls, obtained from previously unpublished case-control studies, were interviewed during 2014-2015 and 2014-2016; that is, many years after the exposure for most cases was ascertained (1993-2015). Few other details of the control groups are provided, except that participation by one set of controls was <50%, raising additional concerns about selection bias. For details on the second set of controls, Marinaccio et al (1) reference a paper by Brandi et al (9). On review of that paper, however, we found no description of the control group, only references to three earlier papers. Marinaccio et al (1) present analyses only with both sets of controls combined; to evaluate potential sources of bias from the use of different sets of controls, they should also report results using each set of controls separately. The authors also did not detail their methods of exposure classification. For example, what does probable or possible exposure mean? The authors should at least present separate analyses of definite occupational exposure. Eighty cases of mTVT were registered, but only 68 were included in the analyses. Information on the 12 omitted cases (eg, age, year of birth, and region) would be helpful. Marinaccio et al (1) did not provide clear information on what occupations and/or industries they considered as exposed to asbestos. In an earlier study, Marinaccio et al (10) remarked on the absence of pericardial mesothelioma and mTVT in industries with the highest exposures to asbestos, saying, ""[t]he absence of exposures in the shipbuilding, railway and asbestos-cement industries ‚Ä¶ for all the 67 pericardial and testicular cases is noteworthy but not easy to interpret."" By contrast, Marinaccio et al (1) stated, ""[t]he economic sectors more frequently associated with asbestos exposure were construction, steel mills, metal-working industry, textile industry and agriculture."" The possibility of exposure in the ""agriculture economic sector"" was not mentioned in Marinaccio et al (10) and appears not to have been considered in previous epidemiologic studies in Italy. In general, epidemiologic studies indicate that farmers and agricultural workers are not at increased risk of developing mesothelioma (eg, 11-17). The fact that few, if any, cases of mTVT and pericardial mesothelioma occurred in industries traditionally associated with high asbestos exposure raises the possibility that the results of Marinaccio et al (1) are attributable to deficiencies in study design, very possibly bias in the selection of controls, and deficiencies in exposure assessment and classification as described above, leading to a spurious association of occupational exposure with mTVT and male pericardial mesothelioma.

32657416,MutCombinator: identification of mutated peptides allowing combinatorial mutations using nucleotide-based graph search.,"<h4>Motivation</h4>Proteogenomics has proven its utility by integrating genomics and proteomics. Typical approaches use data from next-generation sequencing to infer proteins expressed. A sample-specific protein sequence database is often adopted to identify novel peptides from matched mass spectrometry-based proteomics; nevertheless, there is no software that can practically identify all possible forms of mutated peptides suggested by various genomic information sources.<h4>Results</h4>We propose MutCombinator, which enables us to practically identify mutated peptides from tandem mass spectra allowing combinatorial mutations during the database search. It uses an upgraded version of a variant graph, keeping track of frame information. The variant graph is indexed by nine nucleotides for fast access. Using MutCombinator, we could identify more mutated peptides than previous methods, because combinations of point mutations are considered and also because it can be practically applied together with a large mutation database such as COSMIC. Furthermore, MutCombinator supports in-frame search for coding regions and three-frame search for non-coding regions.<h4>Availability and implementation</h4>https://prix.hanyang.ac.kr/download/mutcombinator.jsp.<h4>Supplementary information</h4>Supplementary data are available at Bioinformatics online.",hji,,0,0,1,0.0,,
32696040,Metasubtract: an R-package to analytically produce leave-one-out meta-analysis GWAS summary statistics.,"<h4>Summary</h4>statistics from a meta-analysis of genome-wide association studies (meta-GWAS) can be used for many follow-up analyses. One valuable application is the creation of polygenic scores. However, if polygenic scores are calculated in a validation cohort that was part of the meta-GWAS consortium, this cohort is not independent and analyses will therefore yield inflated results. The R package 'MetaSubtract' was developed to subtract the results of the validation cohort from meta-GWAS summary statistics analytically. The statistical formulas for a meta-analysis were inverted to compute corrected summary statistics of a meta-GWAS leaving one (or more) cohort(s) out. These formulas have been implemented in MetaSubtract for different meta-analyses methods (fixed effects inverse variance or square root sample size weighted z-score) accounting for no, single or double genomic control correction. Results obtained by MetaSubtract correlate very well to those calculated using the traditional way, i.e. by performing a meta-analysis leaving out the validation cohort. In conclusion, MetaSubtract allows researchers to compute meta-GWAS summary statistics that are independent of the GWAS results of the validation cohort without requiring access to the cohort level GWAS results of the corresponding meta-GWAS consortium.<h4>Availability and implementation</h4>https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/MetaSubtract.<h4>Supplementary information</h4>Supplementary data are available at Bioinformatics online.",hji,,0,0,1,0.0,,

32734663,The Bio3D packages for structural bioinformatics.,"Bio3D is a family of R packages for the analysis of biomolecular sequence, structure, and dynamics. Major functionality includes biomolecular database searching and retrieval, sequence and structure conservation analysis, ensemble normal mode analysis, protein structure and correlation network analysis, principal component, and related multivariate analysis methods. Here, we review recent package developments, including a new underlying segregation into separate packages for distinct analysis, and introduce a new method for structure analysis named ensemble difference distance matrix analysis (eDDM). The eDDM approach calculates and compares atomic distance matrices across large sets of homologous atomic structures to help identify the residue wise determinants underlying specific functional processes. An eDDM workflow is detailed along with an example application to a large protein family. As a new member of the Bio3D family, the Bio3D-eddm package supports both experimental and theoretical simulation-generated structures, is integrated with other methods for dissecting sequence-structure-function relationships, and can be used in a highly automated and reproducible manner. Bio3D is distributed as an integrated set of platform independent open source R packages available from: http://thegrantlab.org/bio3d/.",hji,,0,0,1,0.0,,
32742675,Network-based protein structural classification.,"Experimental determination of protein function is resource-consuming. As an alternative, computational prediction of protein function has received attention. In this context, protein structural classification (PSC) can help, by allowing for determining structural classes of currently unclassified proteins based on their features, and then relying on the fact that proteins with similar structures have similar functions. Existing PSC approaches rely on sequence-based or direct three-dimensional (3D) structure-based protein features. By contrast, we first model 3D structures of proteins as protein structure networks (PSNs). Then, we use network-based features for PSC. We propose the use of graphlets, state-of-the-art features in many research areas of network science, in the task of PSC. Moreover, because graphlets can deal only with unweighted PSNs, and because accounting for edge weights when constructing PSNs could improve PSC accuracy, we also propose a deep learning framework that automatically learns network features from weighted PSNs. When evaluated on a large set of approximately 9400 CATH and approximately 12 800 SCOP protein domains (spanning 36 PSN sets), the best of our proposed approaches are superior to existing PSC approaches in terms of accuracy, with comparable running times.

32749460,Development of an online tool for linking behavior change techniques and mechanisms of action based on triangulation of findings from literature synthesis and expert consensus.,"Researchers, practitioners, and policymakers develop interventions to change behavior based on their understanding of how behavior change techniques (BCTs) impact the determinants of behavior. A transparent, systematic, and accessible method of linking BCTs with the processes through which they change behavior (i.e., their mechanisms of action [MoAs]) would advance the understanding of intervention effects and improve theory and intervention development. The purpose of this study is to triangulate evidence for hypothesized BCT-MoA links obtained in two previous studies and present the results in an interactive, online tool. Two previous studies generated evidence on links between 56 BCTs and 26 MoAs based on their frequency in literature synthesis and on expert consensus. Concordance between the findings of the two studies was examined using multilevel modeling. Uncertainties and differences between the two studies were reconciled by 16 behavior change experts using consensus development methods. The resulting evidence was used to generate an online tool. The two studies showed concordance for 25 of the 26 MoAs and agreement for 37 links and for 460 ""nonlinks."" A further 55 links were resolved by consensus (total of 92 [37 + 55] hypothesized BCT-MoA links). Full data on 1,456 possible links was incorporated into the online interactive Theory and Technique Tool (https://theoryandtechniquetool.humanbehaviourchange.org/). This triangulation of two distinct sources of evidence provides guidance on how BCTs may affect the mechanisms that change behavior and is available as a resource for behavior change intervention designers, researchers and theorists, supporting intervention design, research synthesis, and collaborative research.",hji,,0,0,1,0.0,,not life sci - questable if underlying data is available
32753773,hubViz: A Novel Tool for Hub-centric Visualization.,"Visualization algorithms have been widely used for intuitive interrogation of genomic data and popularly used tools include MDS, t-SNE, and UMAP. However, these algorithms are not tuned for the visualization of binary data and none of them consider the hubness of observations for the visualization. In order to address these limitations, here we propose hubViz, a novel tool for hub-centric visualization of binary data. We evaluated the performance of hubViz with its application to the gene expression data measured in multiple brain regions of rats exposed to cocaine, the single-cell RNA-seq data of peripheral blood mononuclear cells treated with interferon beta, and the literature mining data to investigate relationships among diseases. We further evaluated the performance of hubViz using simulation studies. We showed that hubViz provides effective visual inspection by locating the hub in the center and the contrasting elements in the opposite sides around the center. We believe that hubViz and its software can be powerful tools that can improve visualizations of various genomic data. The hubViz is implemented as an R package hubviz, which is publicly available at https://dongjunchung.github.io/hubviz/.",hji,,0,0,1,0.0,,

Since then, it has been wildly spread from Wuhan, China, to Asia, European, and United States to become the pandemic worldwide. Now coronavirus disease 2019 were globally diagnosed over 3 084 740 cases with mortality of 212 561 toll. Current reports variants are found in SARS-CoV-2, majoring in functional ribonucleic acid (RNA) to transcribe into structural proteins as transmembrane spike (S) glycoprotein and the nucleocapsid (N) protein holds the virus RNA genome; the envelope (E) and membrane (M) alone with spike protein form viral envelope. The nonstructural RNA genome includes ORF1ab, ORF3, ORF6, 7a, 8, and ORF10 with highly conserved information for genome synthesis and replication in ORF1ab.<h4>Methods</h4>We apply genomic alignment analysis to observe SARS-CoV-2 sequences from GenBank (http://www.ncbi.nim.nih.gov/genebank/): MN 908947 (China, C1); MN985325 (United States: WA, UW); MN996527 (China, C2); MT007544 (Australia: Victoria, A1); MT027064 (United States: CA, UC); MT039890 (South Korea, K1); MT066175 (Taiwan, T1); MT066176 (Taiwan, T2); LC528232 (Japan, J1); and LC528233 (Japan, J2) and Global Initiative on Sharing All Influenza Data database (https://www.gisaid.org).

32777814,BSAseq: an interactive and integrated web-based workflow for identification of causal mutations in bulked F2 populations.,"<h4>Summary</h4>With the advance of next-generation sequencing technologies and reductions in the costs of these techniques, bulked segregant analysis (BSA) has become not only a powerful tool for mapping quantitative trait loci but also a useful way to identify causal gene mutations underlying phenotypes of interest. However, due to the presence of background mutations and errors in sequencing, genotyping, and reference assembly, it is often difficult to distinguish true causal mutations from background mutations. In this study, we developed the BSAseq workflow, which includes an automated bioinformatics analysis pipeline with a probabilistic model for estimating the linked region (the region linked to the causal mutation) and an interactive Shiny web application for visualizing the results. We deeply sequenced a sorghum male-sterile parental line (ms8) to capture the majority of background mutations in our bulked F2 data. We applied the workflow to 11 bulked sorghum F2 populations and 1 rice F2 population and identified the true causal mutation in each population. The workflow is intuitive and straightforward, facilitating its adoption by users without bioinformatics analysis skills. We anticipate that the BSAseq workflow will be broadly applicable to the identification of causal mutations for many phenotypes of interest.<h4>Availability and implementation</h4>BSAseq is freely available on https://www.sciapps.org/page/bsa.<h4>Supplementary information</h4>Supplementary data are available at Bioinformatics online.",hji,,0,0,1,0.0,,

Abnormality of DNA methylation-related functional elements (DMFEs) may lead to dysfunction of regulatory genes in the progression of cancers, contributing to prognosis of many cancers. There is an urgent need to construct a tool to comprehensively assess the impact of DMFEs on prognosis. Therefore, we developed SurvivalMeth (http://bio-bigdata.hrbmu.edu.cn/survivalmeth) to explore the prognosis-related DMFEs, which documented many kinds of DMFEs, including 309,465 CpG island-related elements, 104,748 transcript-related elements, 77,634 repeat elements, as well as cell-type specific 1,689,653 super enhancers (SE) and 1,304,902 CTCF binding regions for analysis. SurvivalMeth is a convenient tool which collected DNA methylation profiles of 36 cancers and allowed users to query their genes of interest in different datasets for prognosis. Furthermore, SurvivalMeth not only integrated different combinations, including single DMFE, multiple DMFEs, SEs and clinical data, to perform survival analysis on preupload data but also allowed for uploading customized DNA methylation profile of DMFEs from various diseases to analyze. SurvivalMeth provided a comprehensive resource and automated analysis for prognostic DMFEs, including DMFE methylation level, correlation analysis, clinical analysis, differential analysis, DMFE annotation, survival-related detailed result and visualization of survival analysis.

32778891,MolAICal: a soft tool for 3D drug design of protein targets by artificial intelligence and classical algorithm.,"Deep learning is an important branch of artificial intelligence that has been successfully applied into medicine and two-dimensional ligand design. The three-dimensional (3D) ligand generation in the 3D pocket of protein target is an interesting and challenging issue for drug design by deep learning. Here, the MolAICal software is introduced to supply a way for generating 3D drugs in the 3D pocket of protein targets by combining with merits of deep learning model and classical algorithm. The MolAICal software mainly contains two modules for 3D drug design. In the first module of MolAICal, it employs the genetic algorithm, deep learning model trained by FDA-approved drug fragments and Vinardo score fitting on the basis of PDBbind database for drug design. In the second module, it uses deep learning generative model trained by drug-like molecules of ZINC database and molecular docking invoked by Autodock Vina automatically. Besides, the Lipinski's rule of five, Pan-assay interference compounds (PAINS), synthetic accessibility (SA) and other user-defined rules are introduced for filtering out unwanted ligands in MolAICal. To show the drug design modules of MolAICal, the membrane protein glucagon receptor and non-membrane protein SARS-CoV-2 main protease are chosen as the investigative drug targets. The results show MolAICal can generate the various and novel ligands with good binding scores and appropriate XLOGP values.

Data was accessed from the Archive of Data on Disability to Enable Policy and research (ADDEP). The primary analysis applied unbiased recursive partitioning to examine the relationship between serum albumin, injury severity, and long-term outcomes. The analysis is accessible via https://rpubs.com/AnhKhoaVo/586028 .<h4>Results</h4>Serum albumin concentration was significantly associated with lower extremity motor scores (LEMS) and American Spinal Injury Association Impairment Scale (AIS) grade at admission to rehabilitation. Serum albumin concentrations alone were also significantly associated with change of LEMS and marked recovery (improvement of at least 2 AIS grades and/or recovery to walking) at 1-year post injury. However, after adjusting for admission to rehabilitation LEMS and AIS grade, serum albumin was not significant.<h4>Conclusion</h4>The current study partially confirms our previous observations that serum albumin concentrations are associated with neurological outcome after spinal cord injury. As a crude prognostic biomarker, serum albumin concentration could be useful in cases where injury severity cannot be accurately assessed.",hji,,0,0,1,0.0,,

In addition, we built a consensus sequence-catalytic function model from which we identified the novel coronavirus as encoding the same proteinase as the severe acute respiratory syndrome virus. This data-driven sequence-based strategy will enable rapid identification of agents responsible for future epidemics.<h4>Availabilityand implementation</h4>SARS2020 is available at http://design.rxnfinder.org/sars2020/.<h4>Supplementary information</h4>Supplementary data are available at Bioinformatics online.",hji,,0,0,1,0.0,,Chuck Check - discussion - tool - integration but not enough value add - N

Data were collected from 228 youth, 133 of whom were allocated to the 14-week ACDC intervention and 95 to the usual care (UC) control condition. Analyses for the main outcome variable of depressive symptoms were performed using a random effects repeated measures piecewise growth model to estimate trajectory shape over time on an intention-to-treat basis. Results revealed that the reduction in depressive symptoms achieved during the intervention phase continued across the follow-up period for both ACDC and UC (i.e., depressive symptoms showed a significantly decreasing trend in both groups in intervention and follow-up phases); however, no differential effects between conditions were found during the follow-up phase. The direct and indirect effects of the intervention on the other outcome variables' follow-up results were also presented. ISRCTN registry ISRCTN19700389.

32926411,Quantitative SEM characterisation of ceramic target prior and after magnetron sputtering: a case study of aluminium zinc oxide.,"Till now electron microscopy techniques have not been used to evaluate the plasma-target interactions undergone during the magnetron sputtering process. The destructive nature of this interaction severely alters the target microstructure. Utilising quantitative microscopy techniques can shed light on the complex plasma and solid-state processes involved which can ultimately lead to improved functional thin film deposition. As a representative functional material, aluminium-doped-zinc oxide (AZO) is an upcoming alternative to conventional transparent electrode wherein the process optimisation is of great importance. In this paper, we evaluate the pre- and post-sputter field emission scanning electron microscopy (FESEM) data for ceramic AZO target fabricated at three final sintering temperatures (1100¬∞C, 1200¬∞C and 1300¬∞C). In all cases, grain boundaries are merged in addition to a visible reduction in the secondary phases which makes segmentation-based image analysis challenging. Through surface statistics (i.e. fractal dimension, autocorrelation length, texture aspect ratio and entropy) as a function of magnification we can quantify the electron microscopy image of the microstructure. We show that the plasma-microstructure interaction leads to an increase in autocorrelation length, texture aspect ratio and entropy for the optimum AZO ceramic sputtering target sintered at 1200¬∞C. Furthermore, a maximum reduction in fractal dimension span (as determined by exponential regression) is also observed for 1200¬∞C. In addition to the evaluation of plasma effects on sintering, our approach can provide a window towards understanding the underlying thin film growth mechanisms. We believe that this technique can be applied to the defect characterisation of a wide range of polycrystalline ceramic sputtering targets (e.g. ITO, CZTS, GAZO and so on) with the ultimate goal of improving the magnetron sputtering process and the resulting functional thin film. LAY DESCRIPTION: Magnetron sputtering allows scientists to make functional thin films on the order of the nanoscale. In this technique, atoms are plucked from a 'target' then placed onto a substrate forming a thin nanometric film: all thanks to magnets, a special power supply and the fourth state of matter (plasma). Understanding what is going on and how to make a 'good' thin film is important for making better light emitting diodes, solar cells and light sensors. Scientists use electron microscopy to see what is going on in the microstructure of the sputtered thin films to fine tune the sputtering recipe. Here, for the first time, we have applied electron microscopy to see the surface of the microstructure before and after magnetron sputtering. This will help us understanding the plasma-microstructure interaction allowing us to make more informed decisions when fine-tuning the sputtering process to get improved thin films. This is a case study of aluminium-doped zinc oxide (AZO) target that could potentially replace indium tin oxide (ITO), which is widely used as a transparent electrode in devices involving light and electricity. In this case, improved characteristics would be lower electrical resistivity and higher transmission of light. We show that it is possible to use a mathematical description (e.g. the fractal dimension) of the scanning electron microscopy picture to show a link between the target surface and the functional properties.

32973479,Nutil: A Pre- and Post-processing Toolbox for Histological Rodent Brain Section Images.,"With recent technological advances in microscopy and image acquisition of tissue sections, further developments of tools are required for viewing, transforming, and analyzing the ever-increasing amounts of high-resolution data produced. In the field of neuroscience, histological images of whole rodent brain sections are commonly used for investigating brain connections as well as cellular and molecular organization in the normal and diseased brain, but present a problem for the typical neuroscientist with no or limited programming experience in terms of the pre- and post-processing steps needed for analysis. To meet this need we have designed <i>Nutil</i>, an open access and stand-alone executable software that enables automated transformations, post-processing, and analyses of 2D section images using multi-core processing (OpenMP). The software is written in C++ for efficiency, and provides the user with a clean and easy graphical user interface for specifying the input and output parameters. <i>Nutil</i> currently contains four separate tools: (1) A transformation toolchain named ""Transform"" that allows for rotation, mirroring and scaling, resizing, and renaming of very large tiled tiff images. (2) ""TiffCreator"" enables the generation of tiled TIFF images from other image formats such as PNG and JPEG. (3) A ""Resize"" tool completes the preprocessing toolset and allows downscaling of PNG and JPEG images with output in PNG format. (4) The fourth tool is a post-processing method called ""Quantifier"" that enables the quantification of segmented objects in the context of regions defined by brain atlas maps generated with the <i>QuickNII</i> software based on a 3D reference atlas (mouse or rat). The output consists of a set of report files, point cloud coordinate files for visualization in reference atlas space, and reference atlas images superimposed with color-coded objects.

Data from participants aged 18 to 75 years were collected as the baseline survey of Action on Salt China in 2018. Of 5454 adults, 5353 completed 24-hour urine collection. The average sodium, potassium excretion, and sodium-to-potassium molar ratio were 4318.1¬±1814.1 mg/d (equivalent to 11.0¬±4.6 g/d of salt), 1573.7¬±627.1 mg/d, and 5.0¬±2.1, respectively. After adjusting for potential confounding factors and correcting for regression dilution, each 1000-mg increase in sodium excretion was associated with increased systolic BP (1.32 mm‚ÄâHg [95% CI, 0.92-1.81]) and diastolic BP (0.34 mm‚ÄâHg [95% CI, 0.09-0.60]). Each 1000-mg increase in potassium excretion was inversely associated with systolic BP (-3.19 mm‚ÄâHg [95% CI, -4.38 to -2.20]) and diastolic BP (-1.56 mm‚ÄâHg [95% CI, -2.29 to -0.90]). Each unit increase in sodium-to-potassium molar ratio was associated with an increase of systolic BP by 1.21 mm‚ÄâHg (95% CI, 0.91-1.60) and diastolic BP by 0.44 mm‚ÄâHg (95% CI, 0.24-0.64). The relationships between sodium and BP mostly increase with the rise of BP quantiles. Potassium shows the opposite trend. The current sodium intake in Chinese adults remains high and potassium intake is low. Sodium and sodium-to-potassium ratio were positively associated with BP, whereas potassium was inversely associated with BP.

This database is an invaluable resource for researchers in the biological field, which classifies enzyme-related information in categories that are very useful to obtain specific functional and protein engineering information for enzyme families. However, the BRENDA web interface, the most used by researchers with a non-informatic background, does not allow the user to cross-reference data from different categories or sub-categories in the database. Obtaining information in an easy and fast way, in a friendly web interface, without the necessity to have a deep informatics knowledge, will facilitate and improve research in the enzymology and protein engineering field.<h4>Results</h4>We developed the Brenda Easy Search Tool (BEST), an interactive Shiny/R application that enables querying the BRENDA database for complex cross-tabulated characteristics, and retrieving enzyme-related parameters and information readily and efficiently, which can be used for the study of enzyme function or as an input for other bioinformatics tools.<h4>Availability and implementation</h4>BEST and its tutorial are freely available from https://pesb2.cl/best/.<h4>Supplementary information</h4>Supplementary data are available at Bioinformatics online.",hji,,0,0,1,0.0,,

However, analyzing data and generating a report are time consuming and often require trained personnel.<h4>Objective</h4>This study aimed to develop and test an application that can support a local hospital to analyze routinely collected electronic data independently and generate AMR surveillance reports rapidly.<h4>Methods</h4>An offline application to generate standardized AMR surveillance reports from routinely available microbiology and hospital data files was written in the R programming language (R Project for Statistical Computing). The application can be run by double clicking on the application file without any further user input. The data analysis procedure and report content were developed based on the recommendations of the World Health Organization Global Antimicrobial Resistance Surveillance System (WHO GLASS). The application was tested on Microsoft Windows 10 and 7 using open access example data sets. We then independently tested the application in seven hospitals in Cambodia, Lao People's Democratic Republic, Myanmar, Nepal, Thailand, the United Kingdom, and Vietnam.<h4>Results</h4>We developed the AutoMated tool for Antimicrobial resistance Surveillance System (AMASS), which can support clinical microbiology laboratories to analyze their microbiology and hospital data files (in CSV or Excel format) onsite and promptly generate AMR surveillance reports (in PDF and CSV formats). The data files could be those exported from WHONET or other laboratory information systems. The automatically generated reports contain only summary data without patient identifiers.

Host-pathogen interactions (HPIs) are actively studied worldwide to find potential genomic targets for the development of novel drugs, vaccines and other therapeutics. Determining which proteins are involved in the interaction system behind an infectious process is the first step to develop an efficient disease control strategy. Very few computational methods have been implemented as web services to infer novel HPIs, and there is not a single framework which combines several of those approaches to produce and visualize a comprehensive analysis of HPIs.<h4>Results</h4>Here, we introduce PredHPI, a powerful framework that integrates both the detection and visualization of interaction networks in a single web service, facilitating the apprehension of model and non-model host-pathogen systems to aid the biologists in building hypotheses and designing appropriate experiments. PredHPI is built on high-performance computing resources on the backend capable of handling proteome-scale sequence data from both the host as well as pathogen. Data are displayed in an information-rich and interactive visualization, which can be further customized with user-defined layouts. We believe PredHPI will serve as an invaluable resource to diverse experimental biologists and will help advance the research in the understanding of complex infectious diseases.<h4>Availability and implementation</h4>PredHPI tool is freely available at http://bioinfo.usu.edu/PredHPI/.<h4>Supplementary information</h4>Sup plementary data are available at Bioinformatics online.",hji,,0,0,1,0.0,,

The database can be created with either protein or nucleotide sequences containing all entries or complete genomes only. The pipeline can automatically clean the database by removing entries with matches to a database of user-specified sequence contaminants. The default contamination entries include sequences from the UniVec database of plasmids, marker genes and sequencing adapters from NCBI, an E.coli genome, rRNA sequences, vectors and satellite sequences. Furthermore, duplicates are removed and the database is automatically screened for sequences from green fluorescent protein, luciferase and antibiotic resistance genes that might be present in some GenBank viral entries, and could lead to false positives in virus identification. For utilizing the database, we present a useful opportunity for dealing with possible human contamination. We show the applicability of DONE by downloading a virus database comprising 37 virus families. We observed an average increase of 16 776 new entries downloaded per month for the 37 families. In addition, we demonstrate the utility of a custom database compared to a standard reference database for classifying both simulated and real sequence data.<h4>Availabilityand implementation</h4>The DONE pipeline for downloading and cleaning is deposited in a publicly available repository (https://bitbucket.org/genomicepidemiology/done/src/master/).<h4>Supplementary information</h4>Supplementary data are available at Bioinformatics online.",hji,,0,0,1,0.0,,for cleaning databases not a database itself
33054771,smORFunction: a tool for predicting functions of small open reading frames and microproteins.,"<h4>Background</h4>Small open reading frame (smORF) is open reading frame with a length of less than 100 codons. Microproteins, translated from smORFs, have been found to participate in a variety of biological processes such as muscle formation and contraction, cell proliferation, and immune activation. Although previous studies have collected and annotated a large abundance of smORFs, functions of the vast majority of smORFs are still unknown. It is thus increasingly important to develop computational methods to annotate the functions of these smORFs.<h4>Results</h4>In this study, we collected 617,462 unique smORFs from three studies. The expression of smORF RNAs was estimated by reannotated microarray probes. Using a speed-optimized correlation algorism, the functions of smORFs were predicted by their correlated genes with known functional annotations. After applying our method to 5 known microproteins from literatures, our method successfully predicted their functions. Further validation from the UniProt database showed that at least one function of 202 out of 270 microproteins was predicted.<h4>Conclusions</h4>We developed a method, smORFunction, to provide function predictions of smORFs/microproteins in at most 265 models generated from 173 datasets, including 48 tissues/cells, 82 diseases (and normal).

Existing mNGS data analysis tools typically require bioinformatics expertise and access to local server-class hardware resources. For many research laboratories, this presents an obstacle, especially in resource-limited environments.<h4>Findings</h4>We present IDseq, an open source cloud-based metagenomics pipeline and service for global pathogen detection and monitoring (https://idseq.net). The IDseq Portal accepts raw mNGS data, performs host and quality filtration steps, then executes an assembly-based alignment pipeline, which results in the assignment of reads and contigs to taxonomic categories. The taxonomic relative abundances are reported and visualized in an easy-to-use web application to facilitate data interpretation and hypothesis generation. Furthermore, IDseq supports environmental background model generation and automatic internal spike-in control recognition, providing statistics that are critical for data interpretation. IDseq was designed with the specific intent of detecting novel pathogens. Here, we benchmark novel virus detection capability using both synthetically evolved viral sequences and real-world samples, including IDseq analysis of a nasopharyngeal swab sample acquired and processed locally in Cambodia from a tourist from Wuhan, China, infected with the recently emergent SARS-CoV-2.<h4>Conclusion</h4>The IDseq Portal reduces the barrier to entry for mNGS data analysis and enables bench scientists, clinicians, and bioinformaticians to gain insight from mNGS datasets for both known and novel pathogens.",hji,,0,0,1,0.0,,

33086240,The Caregiver Experience After Stroke in a COVID-19 Environment: A Qualitative Study in Inpatient Rehabilitation.,"<h4>Background and purpose</h4>Stroke is the leading cause of disability in the United States. Two-thirds of stroke survivors will require caregiver assistance. Evidence suggests the mental health of caregivers is closely related to patients' health outcomes. The timing of this study intersected with the beginning of the coronavirus disease-2019 (COVID-19) pandemic that required strict social distancing and hospital visitor policy changes. This study aims to answer the primary research question: What is the level and nature of stress experienced by caregivers of persons with newly-acquired stroke in the inpatient rehabilitation setting and how has the COVID-19 pandemic impacted the caregiver experience?<h4>Methods</h4>Recruitment occurred from a single inpatient rehabilitation facility. Participants were administered the Perceived Stress Scale and then completed qualitative semistructured interviews. The investigators used a phenomenological, iterative approach to collect and analyze qualitative data. The data were independently coded and categorized before consolidated into primary themes and subthemes.<h4>Results</h4>Eleven informal caregivers' perspectives generated 13 subthemes across 4 primary thematic categories: COVID-19 impact, concerns of the caregiver, coping strategies, and important aspects of the caregiver experience. COVID-19 social distancing necessitated new visitor policies, which presented additional challenges for caregivers.<h4>Discussion and conclusions</h4>Caregiver attendance at therapy sessions and frequent, direct communication between staff and caregivers improved caregiver readiness for family member discharge following inpatient rehabilitation. This study shared perspectives from a distinctive time during the COVID-19 pandemic. If visitation for multiple therapy sessions is prohibited, we recommend taking alternative measures to keep the caregiver involved in the plan of care.Video Abstract available for more insights from the authors (see the Video, Supplemental Digital Content 1, available at: http://links.lww.com/JNPT/A326).",hji,,0,0,1,0.0,,
33087719,Density functional theory-based electric field gradient database.,"The deviation of the electron density around the nuclei from spherical symmetry determines the electric field gradient (EFG), which can be measured by various types of spectroscopy. Nuclear Quadrupole Resonance (NQR) is particularly sensitive to the EFG. The EFGs, and by implication NQR frequencies, vary dramatically across materials. Consequently, searching for NQR spectral lines in previously uninvestigated materials represents a major challenge. Calculated EFGs can significantly aid at the search's inception. To facilitate this task, we have applied high-throughput density functional theory calculations to predict EFGs for 15187 materials in the JARVIS-DFT database. This database, which will include EFG as a standard entry, is continuously increasing. Given the large scope of the database, it is impractical to verify each calculation.

33098409,SolupHred: a server to predict the pH-dependent aggregation of intrinsically disordered proteins.,"<h4>Summary</h4>Polypeptides are exposed to changing environmental conditions that modulate their intrinsic aggregation propensities. Intrinsically disordered proteins (IDPs) constitutively expose their aggregation determinants to the solvent, thus being especially sensitive to its fluctuations. However, solvent conditions are often disregarded in computational aggregation predictors. We recently developed a phenomenological model to predict IDPs' solubility as a function of the solution pH, which is based on the assumption that both protein lipophilicity and charge depend on this parameter. The model anticipated solubility changes in different IDPs accurately. In this application note, we present SolupHred, a web-based interface that implements the aforementioned theoretical framework into a predictive tool able to compute IDPs aggregation propensities as a function of pH. SolupHred is the first dedicated software for the prediction of pH-dependent protein aggregation.<h4>Availability and implementation</h4>The SolupHred web server is freely available for academic users at: https://ppmclab.pythonanywhere.com/SolupHred.

Due to limited resources and inferior technological capacities, developing countries including Vietnam have faced many challenges in combating the pandemic. Since the first cases were detected on 23 January 2020, Vietnam has undergone a 3-month fierce battle to control the outbreak with stringent measures from the government to mitigate the adverse impacts. In this study, we aim to give insights into the Vietnamese government's progress during the first three months of the outbreak. Additionally, we relatively compare Vietnam's response with that of other Southeast Asia countries to deliver a clear and comprehensive view on disease control strategies.<h4>Methods</h4>The data on the number of COVID-19 confirmed and recovered cases in Vietnam was obtained from the Dashboard for COVID-19 statistics of the Ministry of Health (https://ncov.vncdc.gov.vn/). The review on Vietnam's country-level responses was conducted by searching for relevant government documents issued on the online database 'Vietnam Laws Repository' (https://thuvienphapluat.vn/en/index.aspx), with the grey literature on Google and relevant official websites. A stringency index of government policies and the countries' respective numbers of confirmed cases of nine Southeast Asian countries were adapted from the Oxford COVID-19 Government Response Tracker (https://www.bsg.ox.ac.uk/research/research-projects/coronavirus-government-response-tracker). All data was updated as of 24 April 2020.<h4>Results</h4>Preliminary positive results have been achieved given that the nation confirmed no new community-transmitted cases since 16 April and zero COVID-19 - related deaths throughout the 3-month pandemic period.

33116744,Identification of Novel Therapeutic Molecular Targets in Inflammatory Bowel Disease by Using Genetic Databases.,"<h4>Purpose</h4>Utilization of genetic databases to identify genes involved in ulcerative colitis (UC), Crohn's disease (CD), and their extra-intestinal manifestations.<h4>Methods</h4>Protein coding genes involved in ulcerative colitis (3783 genes), Crohn's disease (3980 genes), uveitis (1043 genes), arthritis (5583 genes), primary sclerosing cholangitis (PSC) (1313 genes), and pyoderma gangrenosum (119 genes) were categorized using four genetic databases. These include Genecards: The Human Gene Database (www.genecards.org), DisGeNET (https://www.disgenet.org/), The Comparative Toxicogenomics Database (http://ctdbase.org/) and the Universal Protein Resource (https://www.uniprot.org/). NDex, Network Data Exchange (http://www.ndexbio.org/), was then utilized for mapping a unique signal pathway from the identified shared genes involved in the above disease processes.<h4>Results</h4>We have detected a unique array of 20 genes with the highest probability of overlay in UC, CD, uveitis, arthritis, pyoderma gangrenosum, and PSC. Figure 1 represents the interactome of these 20 protein coding genes. Of note, unique immune modulators in different disease processes are also noted. Interleukin-25 (IL-25) and monensin-resistant homolog 2 (MON-2) are only noted in UC, CD, pyoderma gangrenosum, and arthritis. Arachidonate 5-lipoxygenase (ALOX5) is involved in UC, CD, and arthritis. SLCO1B3 is exclusively involved with pyoderma gangrenosum, UC, and CD. As expected, TNF involvement is noted in CD, UC, PSC, and arthritis. Table 1 depicts the detailed result.<h4>Conclusion</h4>Our work has identified a distinctive set of genes involved in IBD and its associated extra-intestinal disease processes. These genes play crucial roles in mechanisms of immune response, inflammation, and apoptosis and further our understanding of this complex disease process. We postulate that these genes play a critical role at intersecting pathways involved in inflammatory bowel disease, and these novel molecules, their upstream and downstream effectors, are potential targets for future therapeutic agents.",hji,,0,0,1,0.0,,not descriptive of resource
33135733,Maximum likelihood reconstruction of ancestral networks by integer linear programming.,"<h4>Motivation</h4>The study of the evolutionary history of biological networks enables deep functional understanding of various bio-molecular processes. Network growth models, such as the Duplication-Mutation with Complementarity (DMC) model, provide a principled approach to characterizing the evolution of protein-protein interactions (PPIs) based on duplication and divergence. Current methods for model-based ancestral network reconstruction primarily use greedy heuristics and yield sub-optimal solutions.<h4>Results</h4>We present a new Integer Linear Programming (ILP) solution for maximum likelihood reconstruction of ancestral PPI networks using the DMC model. We prove the correctness of our solution that is designed to find the optimal solution. It can also use efficient heuristics from general-purpose ILP solvers to obtain multiple optimal and near-optimal solutions that may be useful in many applications. Experiments on synthetic data show that our ILP obtains solutions with higher likelihood than those from previous methods, and is robust to noise and model mismatch. We evaluate our algorithm on two real PPI networks, with proteins from the families of bZIP transcription factors and the Commander complex. On both the networks, solutions from our ILP have higher likelihood and are in better agreement with independent biological evidence from other studies.<h4>Availability and implementation</h4>A Python implementation is available at https://bitbucket.org/cdal/network-reconstruction.<h4>Supplementary information</h4>Supplementary data are available at Bioinformatics online.",hji,,0,0,1,0.0,,

33222322,Analysis of mutational signatures with yet another package for signature analysis.,"Different mutational processes leave characteristic patterns of somatic mutations in the genome that can be identified as mutational signatures. Determining the contributions of mutational signatures to cancer genomes allows not only to reconstruct the etiology of somatic mutations, but can also be used for improved tumor classification and support therapeutic decisions. We here present the R package yet another package for signature analysis (YAPSA) to deconvolute the contributions of mutational signatures to tumor genomes. YAPSA provides in-built collections from the COSMIC and PCAWG SNV signature sets as well as the PCAWG Indel signatures and employs signature-specific cutoffs to increase sensitivity and specificity. Furthermore, YAPSA allows to determine 95% confidence intervals for signature exposures, to perform constrained stratified signature analyses to obtain enrichment and depletion patterns of the identified signatures and, when applied to whole exome sequencing data, to correct for the triplet content of individual target capture kits.

The Swiss SOS (Swiss Study on Subarachnoid Hemorrhage) was established in 2008 and offers the unique opportunity to provide this data from the point of care on a nationwide level.<h4>Methods</h4>All patients with confirmed aneurysmal subarachnoid hemorrhage admitted between January 1, 2009 and December 31, 2014, within Switzerland were recorded in a prospective registry. Incidence rates were calculated based on time-matched population data. Admission parameters and outcomes at discharge and at 1 year were recorded.<h4>Results</h4>We recorded data of 1787 consecutive patients. The incidence of aneurysmal subarachnoid hemorrhage in Switzerland was 3.7 per 100 000 persons/y. The number of female patients was 1170 (65.5%). With a follow-up rate of 91.3% at 1 year, 1042 patients (58.8%) led an independent life according to the modified Rankin Scale (0-2). About 1 in 10 patients survived in a dependent state (modified Rankin Scale, 3-5; n=185; 10.4%). Case fatality was 20.1% (n=356) at discharge and 22.1% (n=391) after 1 year.<h4>Conclusions</h4>The current incidence of aneurysmal subarachnoid hemorrhage in Switzerland is lower than expected and an indication of a global trend toward decreasing admissions for ruptured intracranial aneurysms.

The purpose of this study was to evaluate the association of diet with RCC's incidence and mortality rates worldwide. We conducted an ecological study including 170 countries, whose data on age-standardized (AS) incidence and mortality rates of RCC, dietary factors, and potentially confounding factors such as obesity, insufficient physical activity, tobacco smoking, hypertension, diabetes, and human development index (HDI) were collected and available on May 2020 from the Global Cancer Observatory, the Global Dietary Database, the Global Health Observatory data repository, the Diabetes Atlas 9th edition and the Human Development Report 2019. Univariable and multivariable linear regression analyses were performed to determine the association of dietary factors with incidence and mortality rates of RCC adjusted for the effects of population age and potentially confounding factors. Intake of processed meats and consumption of alcohol were both positively associated with AS incidence rates of RCC (Œ≤ = 0.11, <i>P</i>‚Äâ<‚Äâ0.001 and Œ≤ = 0.1, <i>P</i>‚Äâ=‚Äâ0.044, respectively). We suggest that high consumption of processed meats and/or alcohol is a risk factor for RCC. However, they were not associated with mortality.

Undernutrition is a significant challenge among older adults and is associated with poorer health experiences. Digital health for self-monitoring of diet has the potential to increase awareness of personal nutrition, and the scarcity of research reporting older adults' ability and willingness to engage in technology-mediated dietary self-monitoring warranted this study.<h4>Design and methods</h4>An explorative mixed-methods design combining descriptive analysis of log data with qualitative analysis of interviews with Appetitus users was implemented.<h4>Findings</h4>Twenty-five older adults self-monitored their diet using Appetitus over an 8-week trial period. Eighty percent of the participants used the app regularly in the trial period. The most engaged users recorded their food consumption daily for 8 weeks. Personal interest in nutrition and commitment to the project facilitated regular use of Appetitus. Poor health and the perception that using a nutrition app lacked personal relevance contributed to irregular self-monitoring. For inexperienced technology users, participation in this project became a springboard to using tablet technology and the Internet beyond the Appetitus app.<h4>Conclusions</h4>The majority of the participants regularly used Appetitus for self-monitoring of diet; they found the tablet technology and Appetitus app easy to use.<h4>Clinical relevance</h4>Older adults are able and willing to use self-monitoring tools.

33342295,Markedness and implicational relationships in phonological development: A cross-linguistic investigation.,"<h4>Purpose</h4>The complexity approach to speech disorders, based on the theoretical notion of phonological markedness, has been gaining interest over the last decade. In a nutshell, this approach suggests that the acquisition of phonologically marked units (e.g. complex onsets) implies the acquisition of less marked ones (e.g. singleton onsets). However, because the notion of markedness is, itself, subject to controversies, we need to constrain what types of implications can be generalised among language learners, within and across languages.<h4>Method</h4>We report on longitudinal data from one phonologically-disordered and five typically-developing children documented across four different languages (English, French, German, Portuguese), using data from the PhonBank database (https://phonbank.talkbank.org). Using the Phon software program (https://www.phon.ca), we systematically analysed each longitudinal study for consonants in singleton onsets and codas as well as in onset clusters.<h4>Result</h4>The implicational relationships supported by our study involve units of similar types (e.g. relations between different segmental categories), while relationships that involve different types of units or processes cannot be generalised across learners.<h4>Conclusion</h4>A better understanding of implicational relationships makes the complexity approach more predictive of developmental patterns of phonology and related phonological disorders.",hji,,0,0,1,0.0,,not life sci

A total of 46,987 images from 9 tertiary hospitals were used to train, validate, and multicenter test (6:2:2). Moreover, 5,699 images were prospectively enrolled from Qilu Hospital of Shandong University to further assess the system in a prospective test set. The primary outcome was the diagnosis performance of GI lesions in multicenter and prospective tests.<h4>Results</h4>The overall accuracy in identifying early esophageal cancer, early gastric cancer, early colorectal cancer, esophageal varices, reflux esophagitis, Barrett's esophagus, chronic atrophic gastritis, gastric ulcer, colorectal polyp, and ulcerative colitis was 0.8841 (95% confidence interval, 0.8775-0.8904) and 0.8965 (0.8883-0.9041) in multicenter and prospective tests, respectively. The accuracy of cecum and upper GI site identification were 0.9978 (0.9969-0.9984) and 0.8513 (0.8399-0.8620), respectively. The accuracy of staining discrimination was 0.9489 (0.9396-0.9568). The relative error of size measurement was 4.04% (range 0.75%-7.39%).<h4>Discussion</h4>ISRGS is a reliable computer-aided endoscopic report generation system that might assist endoscopists working at various hospital levels to generate standardized and accurate endoscopy reports (http://links.lww.com/CTG/A485).",hji,,0,0,1,0.0,,
33407073,SPServer: split-statistical potentials for the analysis of protein structures and protein-protein interactions.,"<h4>Background</h4>Statistical potentials, also named knowledge-based potentials, are scoring functions derived from empirical data that can be used to evaluate the quality of protein folds and protein-protein interaction (PPI) structures. In previous works we decomposed the statistical potentials in different terms, named Split-Statistical Potentials, accounting for the type of amino acid pairs, their hydrophobicity, solvent accessibility and type of secondary structure. These potentials have been successfully used to identify near-native structures in protein structure prediction, rank protein docking poses, and predict PPI binding affinities.<h4>Results</h4>Here, we present the SPServer, a web server that applies the Split-Statistical Potentials to analyze protein folds and protein interfaces. SPServer provides global scores as well as residue/residue-pair profiles presented as score plots and maps. This level of detail allows users to: (1) identify potentially problematic regions on protein structures; (2) identify disrupting amino acid pairs in protein interfaces; and (3) compare and analyze the quality of tertiary and quaternary structural models.<h4>Conclusions</h4>While there are many web servers that provide scoring functions to assess the quality of either protein folds or PPI structures, SPServer integrates both aspects in a unique easy-to-use web server. Moreover, the server permits to locally assess the quality of the structures and interfaces at a residue level and provides tools to compare the local assessment between structures.

The main challenges include continuous increases in the number of polymorphic genetic variants contained in recent GWASs and reference panels, the rising number of cohorts participating in a GWAS consortium, and inclusion of new variant types. Here, we present GWASinspector, a flexible R package for comprehensive QC of GWAS results. This package is compatible with recent imputation reference panels, handles insertion/deletion and multi-allelic variants, provides extensive QC reports and efficiently processes big data files. Reference panels covering three human genome builds (NCBI36, GRCh37 and GRCh38) are available. GWASinspector has a user friendly design and allows easy set-up of the QC pipeline through a configuration file. In addition to checking and reporting on individual files, it can be used in preparation of a meta-analysis by testing for systemic differences between studies and generating cleaned, harmonized GWAS files. Comparison with existing GWAS QC tools shows that the main advantages of GWASinspector are its ability to more effectively deal with insertion/deletion and multi-allelic variants and its relatively low memory use.<h4>Availability and implementation</h4>Our package is available at The Comprehensive R Archive Network (CRAN): https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=GWASinspector.

Nevertheless, implementation of an electronic health record does not itself ensure benefits for prescribing are maximised. We examine the process of optimisation of ePrescribing systems using case studies to provide policy recommendations based on the experiences of digitally mature hospital sites.<h4>Methods and analysis</h4>Qualitative interviews within six digitally mature sites will be carried out. The aim is to capture successful optimisation of electronic prescribing (ePrescribing) in particular health systems and hospitals. We have identified hospital sites in the UK and in three other developed countries. We used a combination of literature reviews and advice from experts at Optimising ePrescribing in Hospitals (eP Opt) Project round-table events. Sites were purposively selected based on geographical area, innovative work in ePrescribing/electronic health (eHealth) and potential transferability of practices to the UK setting. Interviews will be recorded and transcribed and transcripts coded thematically using NVivo software. Relevant policy and governance documents will be analysed, where available. Planned site visits were suspended due to the COVID-19 pandemic.<h4>Ethics and dissemination</h4>The Usher Research Ethics Group granted approval for this study.

Data-informed decision-making strategies to identify individuals at high risk of dementia are essential to facilitate large-scale prevention and early intervention. This population-based case-control study aims to develop and validate a clinical algorithm for predicting dementia diagnosis, based on the cognitive footprint in personal and medical history.<h4>Methods and analysis</h4>We will use territory-wide electronic health records from the Clinical Data Analysis and Reporting System (CDARS) in Hong Kong between 1 January 2001 and 31 December 2018. All individuals who were at least 65 years old by the end of 2018 will be identified from CDARS. A random sample of control individuals who did not receive any diagnosis of dementia will be matched with those who <i>did</i> receive such a diagnosis by age, gender and index date with 1:1 ratio.

Discovering cancer-subtype-specific drugs is a crucial step in personalized medicine. SubtypeDrug is a system biology R-based software package that enables the prioritization of subtype-specific drugs based on cancer expression data from samples of many subtypes. This provides a novel approach to identify the subtype-specific drug by considering biological functions regulated by drugs at the subpathway level. The operation modes include extraction of subpathways from biological pathways, identification of dysregulated subpathways induced by each drug, inference of sample-specific subpathway activity profiles, evaluation of drug-disease reverse association at the subpathways level, identification of cancer-subtype-specific drugs through subtype sample set enrichment analysis, and visualization of the results. Its capabilities enable SubtypeDrug to find subtype-specific drugs, which will fill the gaps in the recent tools which only identify the drugs for a particular cancer type. SubtypeDrug may help to facilitate the development of tailored treatment for patients with cancer.<h4>Availability and implementation</h4>The package is implemented in R and available under GPL-2 license from the CRAN website (https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=SubtypeDrug).<h4>Supplementary information</h4>Supplementary data are available at Bioinformatics online.",hji,,0,0,1,0.0,,

The Fast Healthcare Interoperability Resources (FHIR¬Æ) standard which is overcoming the interoperability problems in health information exchange was extended to evidence-based medicine (EBM) knowledge with the EBMonFHIR project. A 13-step Code System Development Protocol was created in September 2020 to support global development of terminologies for exchange of scientific evidence. For Step 1, we assembled expert working groups with 55 people from 26 countries by October 2020. For Step 2, we identified 23 commonly used tools and systems for which the first version of code systems will be developed. For Step 3, a total of 368 non-redundant concepts were drafted to become display terms for four code systems (Statistic Type, Statistic Model, Study Design, Risk of Bias). Steps 4 through 13 will guide ongoing development and maintenance of these terminologies for scientific exchange. When completed, the code systems will facilitate identifying, processing, and reporting research results and the reliability of those results. More efficient and detailed scientific communication will reduce cost and burden and improve health outcomes, quality of life, and patient, caregiver, and healthcare professional satisfaction.

33529135,Disruption of the Atrophy-based Functional Network in Multiple Sclerosis Is Associated with Clinical Disability: Validation of a Meta-Analytic Model in Resting-State Functional MRI.,"Background In multiple sclerosis (MS), gray matter (GM) atrophy exhibits a specific pattern, which correlates strongly with clinical disability. However, the mechanism of regional specificity in GM atrophy remains largely unknown. Recently, the network degeneration hypothesis (NDH) was quantitatively defined (using coordinate-based meta-analysis) as the atrophy-based functional network (AFN) model, which posits that localized GM atrophy in MS is mediated by functional networks. Purpose To test the NDH in MS in a data-driven manner using the AFN model to direct analyses in an independent test sample. Materials and Methods Model fit testing was conducted with structural equation modeling, which is based on the computation of semipartial correlations. Model verification was performed in coordinate-based data of healthy control participants from the BrainMap database (<i>https://www.brainmap.org</i>). Model validation was conducted in prospectively acquired resting-state functional MRI in participants with relapsing-remitting MS who were recruited between September 2018 and January 2019. Correlation analyses of model fit indices and volumetric measures with Expanded Disability Status Scale (EDSS) scores and disease duration were performed. Results Model verification of healthy control participants included 80‚Äâ194 coordinates from 9035 experiments. Model verification in healthy control data resulted in excellent model fit (root mean square error of approximation, 0.037; 90% CI: 0.036, 0.039). Twenty participants (mean age, 36 years ¬± 9 [standard deviation]; 12 women) with relapsing-remitting MS were evaluated. Model validation in resting-state functional MRI in participants with MS resulted in deviation from optimal model fit (root mean square error of approximation, 0.071; 90% CI: 0.070, 0.072), which correlated with EDSS scores (<i>r</i> = 0.68; <i>P</i> = .002). Conclusion The atrophy-based functional network model predicts functional network disruption in multiple sclerosis (MS), thereby supporting the network degeneration hypothesis. On resting-state functional MRI scans, reduced functional network integrity in participants with MS had a strong positive correlation with clinical disability. ¬© RSNA, 2021 <i>Online supplemental material is available for this article.</i>",hji,,0,0,1,0.0,,not descriptive of resource
33529731,Deep learning for the radiographic diagnosis of proximal femur fractures: Limitations and programming issues.,"<h4>Introduction</h4>Radiology is one of the domains where artificial intelligence (AI) yields encouraging results, with diagnostic accuracy that approaches that of experienced radiologists and physicians. Diagnostic errors in traumatology are rare but can have serious functional consequences. Using AI as a radiological diagnostic aid may be beneficial in the emergency room. Thus, an effective, low-cost software that helps with making radiographic diagnoses would be a relevant tool for current clinical practice, although this concept has rarely been evaluated in orthopedics for proximal femur fractures (PFF). This led us to conduct a prospective study with the goals of: 1) programming deep learning software to help make the diagnosis of PFF on radiographs and 2) to evaluate its performance.<h4>Hypothesis</h4>It is possible to program an effective deep learning software to help make the diagnosis of PFF based on a limited number of radiographs.<h4>Methods</h4>Our database consisted of 1309 radiographs: 963 had a PFF, while 346 did not. The sample size was increased 8-fold (resulting in 10,472 radiographs) using a validated technique. Each radiograph was evaluated by an orthopedic surgeon using RectLabel‚Ñ¢ software (https://rectlabel.com), by differentiating between healthy and fractured zones. Fractures were classified according to the AO system. The deep learning algorithm was programmed on Tensorflow‚Ñ¢ software (Google Brain, Santa Clara, Ca, USA, tensorflow.org). In all, 9425 annotated radiographs (90%) were used for the training phase and 1074 (10%) for the test phase.<h4>Results</h4>The sensitivity of the algorithm was 61% for femoral neck fractures and 67% for trochanteric fractures. The specificity was 67% and 69%, the positive predictive value was 55% and 56%, while the negative predictive value was 74% and 78%, respectively.<h4>Conclusion</h4>Our results are not good enough for our algorithm to be used in current clinical practice. Programming of deep learning software with sufficient diagnostic accuracy can only be done with several tens of thousands of radiographs, or by using transfer learning.<h4>Level of evidence</h4>III; Diagnostic studies, Study of nonconsecutive patients, without consistently applied reference ""gold"" standard.",hji,,0,0,1,0.0,,

Maternal address during pregnancy, infant size at birth [i.e., birth weight, low birth weight (LBW), body length, and birth head circumference] and covariates were compiled from the Danish Civil Registration System, the Danish Medical Birth Register, and The Integrated Database for Longitudinal Labor Market Research. Linear and logistic models with generalized estimating equations were used to account for multiple births to an individual. Nitrate exposure was modeled using five categories and as a log-transformed continuous variable.<h4>Results</h4>There was evidence of a decreasing trend in models for term birth weight using categorical or continuous measures of exposure. Modeling exposure continuously, a difference of -9.71‚Äâg (95% confidence interval: -14.60, -4.81) was predicted at 25‚Äâmg/L (half the value of the European Union drinking water standard) compared with 0‚Äâmg/L‚ÄâNO3-. Body length also decreased as nitrate concentrations increased in categorical and continuous models. There was little evidence of an association between NO3- and head circumference or LBW.<h4>Discussion</h4>Although the estimated effects were small, our findings for live singleton births to Danish-born parents suggest that maternal intake of nitrate from drinking water may reduce term birth weight and length, which are markers of intrauterine growth. However, there was little evidence for an association between nitrate and head circumference or LBW.

33563213,lncEvo: automated identification and conservation study of long noncoding RNAs.,"<h4>Background</h4>Long noncoding RNAs represent a large class of transcripts with two common features: they exceed an arbitrary length threshold of 200 nt and are assumed to not encode proteins. Although a growing body of evidence indicates that the vast majority of lncRNAs are potentially nonfunctional, hundreds of them have already been revealed to perform essential gene regulatory functions or to be linked to a number of cellular processes, including those associated with the etiology of human diseases. To better understand the biology of lncRNAs, it is essential to perform a more in-depth study of their evolution. In contrast to protein-encoding transcripts, however, they do not show the strong sequence conservation that usually results from purifying selection; therefore, software that is typically used to resolve the evolutionary relationships of protein-encoding genes and transcripts is not applicable to the study of lncRNAs.<h4>Results</h4>To tackle this issue, we developed lncEvo, a computational pipeline that consists of three modules: (1) transcriptome assembly from RNA-Seq data, (2) prediction of lncRNAs, and (3) conservation study-a genome-wide comparison of lncRNA transcriptomes between two species of interest, including search for orthologs. Importantly, one can choose to apply lncEvo solely for transcriptome assembly or lncRNA prediction, without calling the conservation-related part.<h4>Conclusions</h4>lncEvo is an all-in-one tool built with the Nextflow framework, utilizing state-of-the-art software and algorithms with customizable trade-offs between speed and sensitivity, ease of use and built-in reporting functionalities.

This poses significant obstacles for smaller laboratories, or laboratories not affiliated with larger projects, which may not have dedicated bioinformatics staff or computing power to effectively use genomic data to protect public health. Building on the success of the cloud-based Galaxy bioinformatics platform ( http://galaxyproject.org ), already known for its user-friendliness and powerful WGS analytical tools, the Center for Food Safety and Applied Nutrition (CFSAN) at the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) created a customized 'instance' of the Galaxy environment, called GalaxyTrakr ( https://www.galaxytrakr.org ), for use by laboratory scientists performing food-safety regulatory research. The goal was to enable laboratories outside of the FDA internal network to (1) perform quality assessments of sequence data, (2) identify links between clinical isolates and positive food/environmental samples, including those at the National Center for Biotechnology Information sequence read archive ( https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/sra/ ), and (3) explore new methodologies such as metagenomics. GalaxyTrakr hosts a variety of free and adaptable tools and provides the data storage and computing power to run the tools. These tools support coordinated analytic methods and consistent interpretation of results across laboratories. Users can create and share tools for their specific needs and use sequence data generated locally and elsewhere.<h4>Results</h4>In its first full year (2018), GalaxyTrakr processed over 85,000 jobs and went from 25 to 250 users, representing 53 different public and state health laboratories, academic institutions, international health laboratories, and federal organizations. By mid-2020, it has grown to 600 registered users and processed over 450,000 analytical jobs. To illustrate how laboratories are making use of this resource, we describe how six institutions use GalaxyTrakr to quickly analyze and review their data. Instructions for participating in GalaxyTrakr are provided.<h4>Conclusions</h4>GalaxyTrakr advances food safety by providing reliable and harmonized WGS analyses for public health laboratories and promoting collaboration across laboratories with differing resources.

33593821,Therapeutic Targeting of DGKA-Mediated Macropinocytosis Leads to Phospholipid Reprogramming in Tuberous Sclerosis Complex.,"Lymphangioleiomyomatosis is a rare destructive lung disease affecting primarily women and is the primary lung manifestation of tuberous sclerosis complex (TSC). In lymphangioleiomyomatosis, biallelic loss of TSC1/2 leads to hyperactivation of mTORC1 and inhibition of autophagy. To determine how the metabolic vulnerabilities of TSC2-deficient cells can be targeted, we performed a high-throughput screen utilizing the ""Repurposing"" library at the Broad Institute of MIT and Harvard (Cambridge, MA), with or without the autophagy inhibitor chloroquine. Ritanserin, an inhibitor of diacylglycerol kinase alpha (DGKA), was identified as a selective inhibitor of proliferation of Tsc2<sup>-/-</sup> mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEF), with no impact on Tsc2<sup>+/+</sup> MEFs. DGKA is a lipid kinase that metabolizes diacylglycerol to phosphatidic acid, a key component of plasma membranes. Phosphatidic acid levels were increased 5-fold in Tsc2<sup>-/-</sup> MEFs compared with Tsc2<sup>+/+</sup> MEFs, and treatment of Tsc2<sup>-/-</sup> MEFs with ritanserin led to depletion of phosphatidic acid as well as rewiring of phospholipid metabolism. Macropinocytosis is known to be upregulated in TSC2-deficient cells. Ritanserin decreased macropinocytic uptake of albumin, limited the number of lysosomes, and reduced lysosomal activity in Tsc2<sup>-/-</sup> MEFs. In a mouse model of TSC, ritanserin treatment decreased cyst frequency and volume, and in a mouse model of lymphangioleiomyomatosis, genetic downregulation of DGKA prevented alveolar destruction and airspace enlargement. Collectively, these data indicate that DGKA supports macropinocytosis in TSC2-deficient cells to maintain phospholipid homeostasis and promote proliferation. Targeting macropinocytosis with ritanserin may represent a novel therapeutic approach for the treatment of TSC and lymphangioleiomyomatosis. SIGNIFICANCE: This study identifies macropinocytosis and phospholipid metabolism as novel mechanisms of metabolic homeostasis in mTORC1-hyperactive cells and suggest ritanserin as a novel therapeutic strategy for use in mTORC1-hyperactive tumors, including pancreatic cancer.

33634706,Autonomic Alterations After Pulmonary Vein Isolation in the CIRCA-DOSE (Cryoballoon vs Irrigated Radiofrequency Catheter Ablation) Study.,"Background The natural history of autonomic alterations following catheter ablation of drug-refractory paroxysmal atrial fibrillation is poorly defined, largely because of the historical reliance on non-invasive intermittent rhythm monitoring for outcome ascertainment. Methods and Results The study included 346 patients with drug-refractory paroxysmal atrial fibrillation undergoing pulmonary vein isolation using contemporary advanced-generation ablation technologies. All patients underwent insertion of a Reveal LINQ (Medtronic) implantable cardiac monitor before ablation. The implantable cardiac monitor continuously recorded physical activity, heart rate variability (measured as the SD of the average normal-to-normal), daytime heart rate, and nighttime heart rate. Longitudinal autonomic data in the 2-month period leading up to the date of ablation were compared with the period from 91 to 365 days following ablation. Following ablation there was a significant decrease in SD of the average normal-to-normal (mean difference versus baseline of 19.3 ms; range, 12.9-25.7; <i>P</i><0.0001), and significant increases in daytime and nighttime heart rates (mean difference versus baseline of 9.6 bpm; range, 7.4-11.8; <i>P</i><0.0001, and 7.4 bpm; range, 5.4-9.3; <i>P</i><0.0001, respectively). Patients free of arrhythmia recurrence had significantly faster daytime (11¬±11 versus 8¬±12 bpm, <i>P</i>=0.001) and nighttime heart rates (8¬±9 versus 6¬±8 bpm, <i>P</i>=0.049), but no difference in SD of the average normal-to-normal (<i>P</i>=0.09) compared with those with atrial fibrillation recurrence. Ablation technology and cryoablation duration did not influence these autonomic nervous system effects. Conclusions Pulmonary vein isolation results in significant sustained changes in the heart rate parameters related to autonomic function. These changes are correlated with procedural outcome and are independent of the ablation technology used.

Carbapenem-resistant <i>E. coli</i> prevalence was high in market wastewaters [30% (95% CI: 15.0, 45.0)] but low in humans (1%) and poultry (1%). Human, poultry, and wastewater isolates shared common resistance genes: blaCTX-M-1, <i>qnr</i>, and blaTEM. Human colonization was not significantly associated with exposure to poultry or setting (rural, farm, or market). Ninety-five percent of commercial poultry farms routinely administered antibiotics. Susceptibility tests were significantly different in household vs. farm and market poultry isolates for four of seven antibiotic classes. In human isolates, there were no differences except aminoglycoside resistance (16.4% high vs. 4.4% low exposure, p=0.02). Urban market wastewaters and poultry samples had significantly higher concentrations of ESBL-EC (p<0.001) and blaCTX-M-1 (p<0.001) compared with samples from farms and rural households.<h4>Discussion</h4>ESBL-EC colonization was high in humans but not significantly associated with exposure to poultry. Bidirectional transmission of antibiotic resistance is likely between humans, poultry, and the environment in these community settings, underlining the importance of One Health mitigation strategies. https://doi.org/10.1289/EHP7670.",hji,,0,0,1,0.0,,

33684246,Development of machine learning model algorithm for prediction of 5-year soft tissue myxoid liposarcoma survival.,"<h4>Background</h4>Predicting survival in myxoid liposarcoma (MLS) patients is very challenging given its propensity to metastasize and the controversial role of adjuvant therapy. The purpose of this study was to develop a machine-learning algorithm for the prediction of survival at five years for patients with MLS and externally validate it using our institutional cohort.<h4>Methods</h4>Two databases, the surveillance, epidemiology, and end results program (SEER) database and an institutional database, were used in this study. Five machine learning models were created based on the SEER database and performance was rated using the TRIPOD criteria. The model that performed best on the SEER data was again tested on our institutional database.<h4>Results</h4>The net-elastic penalized logistic regression model was the best according to our performance indicators. This model had an area under the curve (AUC) of 0.85 when compared to the SEER testing data and an AUC of 0.76 when tested against institutional database. An application to use this calculator is available at https://sorg-apps.shinyapps.io/myxoid_liposarcoma/.<h4>Conclusion</h4>MLS is a soft-tissue sarcoma with adjunct treatment options that are, in part, decided by prognostic survival.

The differential metabolites between the two groups were searched by the human metabolome (HMDB) database ( https://hmdb.ca/ ) and the related pathways of these potential biomarkers were identified by searching the Kyoto encyclopedia of genes and genomes (KEGG) database ( https://www.kegg.jp/ ). The total metabolic pathways were analyzed by the MS Peaks to Pathways module of MetaboAnalyst ( https://www.metaboanalyst.ca/ ).<h4>Results</h4>Multivariate data analysis found that serum and urine metabolism in AKI patients was significantly different from healthy people. We found three metabolites in urine (2-S-glutathionyl glutathione acetate, 5-L-Glutamyl-taurine, and L-Phosphoarginine) contributing to the separation of AKI patients from healthy people, and major metabolic pathways associated with these potential biomarkers including cytochrome P450 metabolism, arginine, and proline metabolism.<h4>Conclusion</h4>2-S-glutathionyl glutathione acetate, 5-L-Glutamyl-taurine, and L-Phosphoarginine were associated with AKI patients, which could be selected as potential biomarkers to predicate AKI disease.",hji,,0,0,1,0.0,,not descriptive of resources
33689356,XlinkCyNET: A Cytoscape Application for Visualization of Protein Interaction Networks Based on Cross-Linking Mass Spectrometry Identifications.,"Software tools that allow the visualization and analysis of protein interaction networks are essential for studies in systems biology. One of the most popular network visualization tools in biology is Cytoscape, which offers a great selection of plug-ins for the interpretation of network data.

33719338,Construction of circRNA-Based ceRNA Network to Reveal the Role of circRNAs in the Progression and Prognosis of Hepatocellular Carcinoma.,"<h4>Background</h4>Circular RNAs (circRNAs) are now under hot discussion as novel promising biomarkers for patients with hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). The purpose of our study is to identify several competing endogenous RNA (ceRNA) networks related to the prognosis and progression of HCC and to further investigate the mechanism of their influence on tumor progression.<h4>Methods</h4>First, we obtained gene expression data related to liver cancer from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) database (http://www.portal.gdc.cancer.gov/), including microRNA (miRNA) sequence, RNA sequence, and clinical information. A co-expression network was constructed through the Weighted Correlation Network Analysis (WGCNA) software package in R software. The differentially expressed messenger RNAs (DEmRNAs) in the key module were analyzed with the Database for Annotation Visualization and Integrated Discovery (DAVID) (https://david.ncifcrf.gov/summary.jsp) to perform functional enrichment analysis including Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) and Gene Ontology (GO). The data of miRNA expression and clinical information downloaded from TCGA were utilized for survival analysis to detach the prognostic value of the DEmiRNAs of the key module.<h4>Results</h4>The 201 differentially expressed miRNAs (DEmiRNAs) and 3,783 DEmRNAs were preliminarily identified through differential expression analysis. The co-expression networks of DEmiRNAs and DEmRNAs were constructed with WGCNA. Further analysis confirmed four miRNAs in the most significant module (blue module) were associated with the overall survival (OS) of patients with liver cancer, including hsa-miR-92b-3p, hsa-miR-122-3p, hsa-miR-139-5p, and hsa-miR-7850-5p. DAVID was used for functional enrichment analysis of 286 co-expressed mRNAs. The GO analysis results showed that the top enriched GO terms were oxidation-reduction process, extracellular exosome, and iron ion binding. In KEGG pathway analysis, the top three enriched terms included metabolic pathways, fatty acid degradation, and valine, leucine, and isoleucine degradation. In addition, we intersected the miRNA-mRNA interaction prediction results with the differentially expressed and prognostic mRNAs. We found that hsa-miR-92b-3p can be related to CPEB3 and ACADL. By overlapping the data of predicted circRNAs by circBank and differentially expressed circRNAs of GSE94508, we screened has_circ_0077210 as the upstream regulatory molecule of hsa-miR-92b-3p. Hsa_circ_0077210/hsa-miR-92b-3p/cytoplasmic polyadenylation element binding protein-3 (CPEB3) and acyl-Coenzyme A dehydrogenase, long chain (ACADL) were validated in HCC tissue.<h4>Conclusion</h4>Our research provides a mechanistic elucidation of the unknown ceRNA regulatory network in HCC. Hsa_circ_0077210 might serve a momentous therapeutic role to restrain the occurrence and development of HCC.",hji,,0,0,1,0.0,,not descriptive of resource
33728932,Metabolic Dyslipidemia and Cardiovascular Outcomes in Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus: Findings From the Look AHEAD Study.,"Background Metabolic dyslipidemia (high triglyceride) and low high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C) is highly prevalent in type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM). The extent to which diabetes mellitus-related abnormalities in the triglyceride-HDL-C profile associates with cardiovascular disease (CVD) risk is incompletely understood. We evaluated the associations of triglyceride and HDL-C status with CVD outcomes in individuals with T2DM. Methods and Results We analyzed data from 4199 overweight/obese adults with T2DM free of CVD with available data on triglyceride and HDL-C at baseline (2001-2004) in the Look AHEAD (Action for Health in Diabetes) study. We used Cox proportional models to estimate hazard ratios (HRs) and 95% CIs of: (1) composite CVD outcome (myocardial infarction, stroke, hospitalization for angina, and/or death from cardiovascular causes); (2) coronary artery disease events; and (3) cerebrovascular accidents (stroke). Of the 4199 participants, 62% (n=2600) were women, with a mean age of 58 years (SD, 7), and 40% (n=1659) had metabolic dyslipidemia at baseline. Over a median follow-up of 9.5 years (interquartile range, 8.7-10.3), 500 participants experienced the composite CVD outcome, 396 experienced coronary artery disease events, and 100 experienced stroke. Low HDL-C was associated with higher hazards of the composite CVD outcome (HR, 1.36; 95% CI, 1.12-1.64 [<i>P</i>=0.002]) and coronary artery disease events (HR, 1.46; 95% CI, 1.18-1.81 [<i>P</i>=0.001]) but not stroke (HR, 1.38; 95% CI, 0.90-2.11 [<i>P</i>=0.140]). Compared with patients with normal triglyceride and normal HDL, participants with metabolic dyslipidemia had higher risks of the composite CVD outcome (HR, 1.30; 95% CI, 1.03-1.63 [<i>P</i>=0.025]) and coronary artery disease events (HR, 1.48; 95% CI, 1.14-1.93 [<i>P</i>=0.003]) but not stroke (HR, 1.23; 95% CI, 0.74-2.05 [<i>P</i>=0.420]). Conclusions In a large sample of overweight/obese individuals with T2DM, metabolic dyslipidemia was associated with higher risks of CVD outcomes. Our findings highlight the necessity to account for metabolic dyslipidemia in CVD risk stratification among patients with T2DM.

33729791,Epigenetic Target Profiler: A Web Server to Predict Epigenetic Targets of Small Molecules.,"The identification of protein targets of small molecules is essential for drug discovery. With the increasing amount of chemogenomic data in the public domain, multiple ligand-based models for target prediction have emerged. However, these models are generally biased by the number of known ligands for different targets, which involves an under-representation of epigenetic targets, and despite the increasing importance of epigenetic targets in drug discovery, there are no open tools for epigenetic target prediction. In this work, we introduce Epigenetic Target Profiler (ETP), a freely accessible and easy-to-use web application for the prediction of epigenetic targets of small molecules. For a query compound, ETP predicts its bioactivity profile over a panel of 55 different epigenetic targets. To that aim, ETP uses a consensus model based on two binary classification models for each target, relying on support vector machines and built on molecular fingerprints of different design. A distance-to-model parameter related to the reliability of the predictions is included to facilitate their interpretability and assist in the identification of small molecules with potential epigenetic activity.

To guide this technically challenging data integration task and to make gene discovery and hypotheses generation easier for researchers, we have developed a comprehensive software package called KnetMiner which is open-source and containerized for easy use. KnetMiner is an integrated, intelligent, interactive gene and gene network discovery platform that supports scientists explore and understand the biological stories of complex traits and diseases across species. It features fast algorithms for generating rich interactive gene networks and prioritizing candidate genes based on knowledge mining approaches. KnetMiner is used in many plant science institutions and has been adopted by several plant breeding organizations to accelerate gene discovery. The software is generic and customizable and can therefore be readily applied to new species and data types; for example, it has been applied to pest insects and fungal pathogens; and most recently repurposed to support COVID-19 research. Here, we give an overview of the main approaches behind KnetMiner and we report plant-centric case studies for identifying genes, gene networks and trait relationships in Triticum aestivum (bread wheat), as well as, an evidence-based approach to rank candidate genes under a large Arabidopsis thaliana QTL.

However, valuable software is in this context not only defined by a powerful algorithm to separate correct from false identifications, but also by constant maintenance and continuous improvements.<h4>Methods</h4>In 2014, we presented our peptide identification algorithm MS Amanda, showing its suitability for identifying peptides in high-resolution tandem mass spectrometry data and its ability to outperform widely used tools to identify peptides. Since then, we have continuously worked on improvements to enhance its usability and to support new trends and developments in this fast-growing field, while keeping the original scoring algorithm to assess the quality of a peptide spectrum match unchanged.<h4>Results</h4>We present the outcome of these efforts, MS Amanda 2.0, a faster and more flexible standalone version with the original scoring algorithm. The new implementation has led to a 3-5√ó speedup, is able to handle new ion types and supports standard data formats.

33766657,An early-morning gene network controlled by phytochromes and cryptochromes regulates photomorphogenesis pathways in Arabidopsis.,"Light perception at dawn plays a key role in coordinating multiple molecular processes and in entraining the plant circadian clock. The Arabidopsis mutant lacking the main photoreceptors, however, still shows clock entrainment, indicating that the integration of light into the morning transcriptome is not well understood. In this study, we performed a high-resolution RNA-sequencing time-series experiment, sampling every 2 min beginning at dawn. In parallel experiments, we perturbed temperature, the circadian clock, photoreceptor signaling, and chloroplast-derived light signaling. We used these data to infer a gene network that describes the gene expression dynamics after light stimulus in the morning, and then validated key edges. By sampling time points at high density, we are able to identify three light- and temperature-sensitive bursts of transcription factor activity, one of which lasts for only about 8 min. Phytochrome and cryptochrome mutants cause a delay in the transcriptional bursts at dawn, and completely remove a burst of expression in key photomorphogenesis genes (HY5 and BBX family). Our complete network is available online (http://www-users.york.ac.uk/‚àºde656/dawnBurst/dawnBurst.html). Taken together, our results show that phytochrome and cryptochrome signaling is required for fine-tuning the dawn transcriptional response to light, but separate pathways can robustly activate much of the program in their absence.",hji,,0,0,1,0.0,,

33777034,TCRMatch: Predicting T-Cell Receptor Specificity Based on Sequence Similarity to Previously Characterized Receptors.,"The adaptive immune system in vertebrates has evolved to recognize non-self antigens, such as proteins expressed by infectious agents and mutated cancer cells. T cells play an important role in antigen recognition by expressing a diverse repertoire of antigen-specific receptors, which bind epitopes to mount targeted immune responses. Recent advances in high-throughput sequencing have enabled the routine generation of T-cell receptor (TCR) repertoire data. Identifying the specific epitopes targeted by different TCRs in these data would be valuable. To accomplish that, we took advantage of the ever-increasing number of TCRs with known epitope specificity curated in the Immune Epitope Database (IEDB) since 2004. We compared seven metrics of sequence similarity to determine their power to predict if two TCRs have the same epitope specificity. We found that a comprehensive <i>k</i>-mer matching approach produced the best results, which we have implemented into TCRMatch, an openly accessible tool (http://tools.iedb.org/tcrmatch/) that takes TCR Œ≤-chain CDR3 sequences as an input, identifies TCRs with a match in the IEDB, and reports the specificity of each match.

33794377,Identifying Novel Drug Targets by iDTPnd: A Case Study of Kinase Inhibitors.,"Current FDA-approved kinase inhibitors cause diverse adverse effects, some of which are due to the mechanism-independent effects of these drugs. Identifying these mechanism-independent interactions could improve drug safety and support drug repurposing. We have developed iDTPnd (integrated Drug Target Predictor with negative dataset), a computational approach for large-scale discovery of novel targets for known drugs. For a given drug, we construct a positive and a negative structural signature that captures the weakly conserved structural features of drug binding sites. To facilitate assessment of unintended targets, iDTPnd also provides a docking-based interaction score and its statistical significance. We were able to confirm the interaction of sorafenib, imatinib, dasatinib, sunitinib, and pazopanib with their known targets at a sensitivity and specificity of 52% and 55%, respectively. We have validated 10 predicted novel targets by using in vitro experiments. Our results suggest that proteins other than kinases, such as nuclear receptors, cytochrome P450, or MHC Class I molecules can also be physiologically relevant targets of kinase inhibitors. Our method is general and broadly applicable for the identification of protein-small molecule interactions, when sufficient drug-target 3D data are available.

33823117,Exploring Parental Perspectives of Childhood Speech and Language Disorders Across 10 Countries: A Pilot Qualitative Study.,"Purpose Although researchers have explored parental perspectives of childhood speech and language disorders, most studies have been conducted in English-speaking countries. Little is known about parental experiences across countries, where procedures of language screening and services for language disorders differ. The authors participated in the COST <sup>1</sup> Action network IS1406, ""Enhancing Children's Oral Language Skills Across Europe and Beyond,"" which provided an opportunity to conduct cross-country qualitative interviews with parents. The aim of this pilot study was to explore ways in which parents construed and described speech and language disorders across countries. Method Semistructured qualitative interviews were conducted with parents from 10 families in 10 different countries. The data were analyzed using thematic analysis. Findings The overall theme was ""acknowledging parental expertise."" The parents described, in detail, ways in which their children's speech and language (dis)abilities had an impact on the children's everyday life. Three subthemes were identified: impairment, disability, and changes over time. Conclusions The findings suggest that, across a range of countries, parents demonstrated contextualized understandings of their children's speech and language (dis)abilities, along with the everyday functional implications of the disorders. Hence, despite not holding professional knowledge about language disorders, the voices, views, understandings, and personal experiences of parents in relation to their child's disorder should be listened to when planning therapy services.

33823122,Long-Term Outcomes in Intensive Care Unit Patients with Delirium: A Population-Based Cohort Study.,"<h4>Rationale</h4>Delirium is common in the intensive care unit (ICU) and portends worse ICU and hospital outcomes. The effect of delirium in the ICU on post-hospital discharge mortality and health resource utilization is less well known.<h4>Objectives</h4>To estimate mortality and health resource utilization 2.5-years post-hospital discharge in critically ill patients admitted to ICU.<h4>Methods</h4>Population-based, propensity-score matched, retrospective cohort study of adult patients admitted to one of fourteen medical-surgical ICUs from January 1, 2014 to June 30, 2016. Delirium was measured by the 8-point Intensive Care Delirium Screening Checklist (ICDSC). The primary outcome was mortality. The secondary outcome was a composite measure of subsequent emergency department visits, hospital readmission, or mortality.<h4>Measurements and main results</h4>There were 5,936 propensity score matched patients with and without incident delirium who survived to hospital discharge. Delirium was associated with increased mortality 0 to 30-days post-hospital discharge [Hazard Ratio (HR): 1.44 (95%CI: 1.08-1.92)]. There was no significant difference in mortality more than 30 days post-hospital discharge (delirium: 3.9%, no delirium: 2.6%). There was a persistent increased risk of emergency department visits, hospital readmissions, or mortality post-hospital discharge [HR: 1.12 (95%CI: 1.07-1.17)] throughout the study period.<h4>Conclusions</h4>ICU delirium is associated with increased mortality 0 to 30 days post-hospital discharge.

33840048,Rank-preserving biclustering algorithm: a case study on miRNA breast cancer.,"Effective biomarkers aid in the early diagnosis and monitoring of breast cancer and thus play an important role in the treatment of patients suffering from the disease. Growing evidence indicates that alteration of expression levels of miRNA is one of the principal causes of cancer. We analyze breast cancer miRNA data to discover a list of biclusters as well as breast cancer miRNA biomarkers which can help to understand better this critical disease and take important clinical decisions for treatment and diagnosis. In this paper, we propose a pattern-based parallel biclustering algorithm termed Rank-Preserving Biclustering (RPBic). The key strategy is to identify rank-preserved rows under a subset of columns based on a modified version of all substrings common subsequence (ALCS) framework. To illustrate the effectiveness of the RPBic algorithm, we consider synthetic datasets and show that RPBic outperforms relevant biclustering algorithms in terms of relevance and recovery. For breast cancer data, we identify 68 biclusters and establish that they have strong clinical characteristics among the samples. The differentially co-expressed miRNAs are found to be involved in KEGG cancer related pathways. Moreover, we identify frequency-based biomarkers (hsa-miR-410, hsa-miR-483-5p) and network-based biomarkers (hsa-miR-454, hsa-miR-137) which we validate to have strong connectivity with breast cancer.

33850871,Development and validation of a prediction model for lung adenocarcinoma based on RNA-binding protein.,"<h4>Background</h4>RNA-binding proteins (RBPs) have been found to participate in the development and progression of cancer. This present study aimed to construct a RBP-based prognostic prediction model for lung adenocarcinoma (LUAD).<h4>Methods</h4>RNA sequencing data and corresponding clinical information were acquired from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) and served as a training set. The prediction model was validated using the dataset in Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) databases. Univariate and multivariate Cox regression analyses were conducted to identify the RBPs associated with survival. R software (http://www.r-project.org) was used for analysis in this study.<h4>Results</h4>Nine hub prognostic RBPs (<i>CIRBP, DARS2, DDX24, GAPDH, LARP6, SNRPE, WDR3, ZC3H12C, ZC3H12D</i>) were identified by univariate Cox regression analysis and multivariate Cox regression analysis. Using a risk score based on the nine-hub RBP model, we separated the LUAD patients into a low-risk group and a high-risk group. The outcomes revealed that patients in the high-risk group had poorer survival than those in the low-risk group. This signature was validated in the GEO database. Further study revealed that the risk score can be an independent prognostic biomarker for LUAD. A nomogram based on the nine hub RBPs was built to quantitatively predict the prognosis of LUAD patients.<h4>Conclusions</h4>Our nine-gene signature model could be used as a marker to predict the prognosis of LUAD and has potential for use in treatment individualization.",hji,,0,0,1,0.0,,
33854526,GeenaR: A Web Tool for Reproducible MALDI-TOF Analysis.,"Mass spectrometry is a widely applied technology with a strong impact in the proteomics field. MALDI-TOF is a combined technology in mass spectrometry with many applications in characterizing biological samples from different sources, such as the identification of cancer biomarkers, the detection of food frauds, the identification of doping substances in athletes' fluids, and so on. The massive quantity of data, in the form of mass spectra, are often biased and altered by different sources of noise. Therefore, extracting the most relevant features that characterize the samples is often challenging and requires combining several computational methods. Here, we present GeenaR, a novel web tool that provides a complete workflow for pre-processing, analyzing, visualizing, and comparing MALDI-TOF mass spectra. GeenaR is user-friendly, provides many different functionalities for the analysis of the mass spectra, and supports reproducible research since it produces a human-readable report that contains function parameters, results, and the code used for processing the mass spectra. First, we illustrate the features available in GeenaR. Then, we describe its internal structure. Finally, we prove its capabilities in analyzing oncological datasets by presenting two case studies related to ovarian cancer and colorectal cancer.

The main objective of the study has been to describe the clinical nurse tutor's skills, required to properly train nursing students during their educational path.<h4>Methods</h4>In this observational study a non-probability sampling has been used. The study was led in two centers: the AOUPR of Parma and the AUSL of Parma, after obtaining the favorable opinion from the Ethics Committee of the Northern Emilia Large Section. The data have been collected by using a structured and self-given survey that investigated three areas. Each item has a 4-point Likert scale, in which 1 indicates ""for nothing"" and 4 ""very much"". The data have been analyzed with the statistical software IBM SPSS v.26 ¬Æ and with the open-source statistical software Jamovi v.1.6.9 (https://www.jamovi.org.). The number of factors in the original model was reduced using several established research steps and then evaluated for data quality and construct validity using principal component analysis and confimatory factor analysis.<h4>Results</h4>Among 397 administered questionnaires, only 300, which were considered valid, have been filled. The psychometric properties of the investigation tool turned out to be good in all the areas analyzed with a Cronbach alpha higher than 0.70. The extensive process resulted in a version with 4 factors.<h4>Conclusions</h4>Nurses' answers have allowed to draw the required profile of the clinical tutors in the different organizational contexts.

33858322,ChIP-BIT2: a software tool to detect weak binding events using a Bayesian integration approach.,"<h4>Background</h4>ChIP-seq combines chromatin immunoprecipitation assays with sequencing and identifies genome-wide binding sites for DNA binding proteins. While many binding sites have strong ChIP-seq 'peak' observations and are well captured, there are still regions bound by proteins weakly, with a relatively low ChIP-seq signal enrichment. These weak binding sites, especially those at promoters and enhancers, are functionally important because they also regulate nearby gene expression. Yet, it remains a challenge to accurately identify weak binding sites in ChIP-seq data due to the ambiguity in differentiating these weak binding sites from the amplified background DNAs.<h4>Results</h4>ChIP-BIT2 ( http://sourceforge.net/projects/chipbitc/ ) is a software package for ChIP-seq peak detection. ChIP-BIT2 employs a mixture model integrating protein and control ChIP-seq data and predicts strong or weak protein binding sites at promoters, enhancers, or other genomic locations. For binding sites at gene promoters, ChIP-BIT2 simultaneously predicts their target genes. ChIP-BIT2 has been validated on benchmark regions and tested using large-scale ENCODE ChIP-seq data, demonstrating its high accuracy and wide applicability.<h4>Conclusion</h4>ChIP-BIT2 is an efficient ChIP-seq peak caller. It provides a better lens to examine weak binding sites and can refine or extend the existing binding site collection, providing additional regulatory regions for decoding the mechanism of gene expression regulation.",hji,,0,0,1,0.0,,
33863373,IrGO: Iranian traditional medicine General Ontology and knowledge base.,"<h4>Background</h4>Iranian traditional medicine, also known as Persian Medicine, is a holistic school of medicine with a long prolific history. It describes numerous concepts and the relationships between them. However, no unified language system has been proposed for the concepts of this medicine up to the present time. Considering the extensive terminology in the numerous textbooks written by the scholars over centuries, comprehending the totality of concepts is obviously a very challenging task. To resolve this issue, overcome the obstacles, and code the concepts in a reusable manner, constructing an ontology of the concepts of Iranian traditional medicine seems a necessity.<h4>Construction and content</h4>Makhzan al-Advieh, an encyclopedia of materia medica compiled by Mohammad Hossein Aghili Khorasani, was selected as the resource to create an ontology of the concepts used to describe medicinal substances. The steps followed to accomplish this task included (1) compiling the list of classes via examination of textbooks, and text mining the resource followed by manual review to ensure comprehensiveness of extracted terms; (2) arranging the classes in a taxonomy; (3) determining object and data properties; (4) specifying annotation properties including ID, labels (English and Persian), alternative terms, and definitions (English and Persian); (5) ontology evaluation. The ontology was created using Prot√©g√© with adherence to the principles of ontology development provided by the Open Biological and Biomedical Ontology (OBO) foundry.<h4>Utility and discussion</h4>The ontology was finalized with inclusion of 3521 classes, 15 properties, and 20,903 axioms in the Iranian traditional medicine General Ontology (IrGO) database, freely available at http://ir-go.net/ . An indented list and an interactive graph view using WebVOWL were used to visualize the ontology. All classes were linked to their instances in UNaProd database to create a knowledge base of ITM materia medica.<h4>Conclusion</h4>We constructed an ontology-based knowledge base of ITM concepts in the domain of materia medica to help offer a shared and common understanding of this concept, enable reuse of the knowledge, and make the assumptions explicit. This ontology will aid Persian medicine practitioners in clinical decision-making to select drugs. Extending IrGO will bridge the gap between traditional and conventional schools of medicine, helping guide future research in the process of drug discovery.",hji,,0,0,1,0.0,,out of scope
33877858,Developing a Flexible National Wastewater Surveillance System for COVID-19 and Beyond.,"<h4>Background</h4>Wastewater testing offers a cost-effective strategy for measuring population disease prevalence and health behaviors. For COVID-19, wastewater surveillance addresses testing gaps and provides an early warning for outbreaks. As U.S. federal agencies build a National Wastewater Surveillance System around the pandemic, thinking through ways to develop flexible frameworks for wastewater sampling, testing, and reporting can avoid unnecessary system overhauls for future infectious disease, chronic disease, and drug epidemics.<h4>Objectives</h4>We discuss ways to transform a historically academic exercise into a tool for epidemic response. We generalize lessons learned by a global network of wastewater researchers around validation and implementation for COVID-19 and opioids while also drawing on our experience with wastewater-based epidemiology in the United States.<h4>Discussion</h4>Sustainable wastewater surveillance requires coordination between health and safety officials, utilities, labs, and researchers. Adapting sampling frequency, type, and location to threat level, community vulnerability, biomarker properties, and decisions that wastewater data will inform can increase the practical value of the data. Marketplace instabilities, coupled with a fragmented testing landscape due to specialization, may require officials to engage multiple labs to test for known and unknown threats. Government funding can stabilize the market, balancing commercial pressures with public good, and incentivize data sharing. When reporting results, standardizing metrics and contextualizing wastewater data with health resource data can provide insights into a community's vulnerability and identify strategies to prevent health care systems from being overwhelmed. If wastewater data will inform policy decisions for an entire community, comparing characteristics of the wastewater treatment plant's service population to those of the larger community can help determine whether the wastewater data are generalizable. Ethical protocols may be needed to protect privacy and avoid stigmatization. With data-driven approaches to sample collection, analysis, and interpretation, officials can use wastewater surveillance for adaptive resource allocation, pandemic management, and program evaluation. https://doi.org/10.1289/EHP8572.",hji,,0,0,1,0.0,,
33882120,APICURON: a database to credit and acknowledge the work of biocurators.,"APICURON is an open and freely accessible resource that tracks and credits the work of biocurators across multiple participating knowledgebases. Biocuration is essential to extract knowledge from research data and make it available in a structured and standardized way to the scientific community. However, processing biological data-mainly from literature-requires a huge effort that is difficult to attribute and quantify. APICURON collects biocuration events from third-party resources and aggregates this information, spotlighting biocurator contributions. APICURON promotes biocurator engagement implementing gamification concepts like badges, medals and leaderboards and at the same time provides a monitoring service for registered resources and for biocurators themselves. APICURON adopts a data model that is flexible enough to represent and track the majority of biocuration activities. Biocurators are identified through their Open Researcher and Contributor ID. The definition of curation events, scoring systems and rules for assigning badges and medals are resource-specific and easily customizable. Registered resources can transfer curation activities on the fly through a secure and robust Application Programming Interface (API). Here, we show how simple and effective it is to connect a resource to APICURON, describing the DisProt database of intrinsically disordered proteins as a use case. We believe APICURON will provide biological knowledgebases with a service to recognize and credit the effort of their biocurators, monitor their activity and promote curator engagement.

33882829,Gene-set distance analysis (GSDA): a powerful tool for gene-set association analysis.,"<h4>Background</h4>Identifying sets of related genes (gene sets) that are empirically associated with a treatment or phenotype often yields valuable biological insights. Several methods effectively identify gene sets in which individual genes have simple monotonic relationships with categorical, quantitative, or censored event-time variables. Some distance-based methods, such as distance correlations, may detect complex non-monotone associations of a gene-set with a quantitative variable that elude other methods. However, the distance correlations have yet to be generalized to associate gene-sets with categorical and censored event-time endpoints. Also, there is a need to determine which genes empirically drive the significance of an association of a gene set with an endpoint.<h4>Results</h4>We develop gene-set distance analysis (GSDA) by generalizing distance correlations to evaluate the association of a gene set with categorical and censored event-time variables. We also develop a backward elimination procedure to identify a subset of genes that empirically drive significant associations. In simulation studies, GSDA more effectively identified complex non-monotone gene-set associations than did six other published methods. In the analysis of a pediatric acute myeloid leukemia (AML) data set, GSDA was the only method to discover that event-free survival (EFS) was associated with the 56-gene AML pathway gene-set, narrow that result down to 5 genes, and confirm the association of those 5 genes with EFS in a separate validation cohort. These results indicate that GSDA effectively identifies and characterizes complex non-monotonic gene-set associations that are missed by other methods.<h4>Conclusion</h4>GSDA is a powerful and flexible method to detect gene-set association with categorical, quantitative, or censored event-time variables, especially to detect complex non-monotonic gene-set associations.

33906374,Genetic Causes of Cardiomyopathy in Children: First Results From the Pediatric Cardiomyopathy Genes Study.,"Background Pediatric cardiomyopathy is a genetically heterogeneous disease with substantial morbidity and mortality. Current guidelines recommend genetic testing in children with hypertrophic, dilated, or restrictive cardiomyopathy, but practice variations exist. Robust data on clinical testing practices and diagnostic yield in children are lacking. This study aimed to identify the genetic causes of cardiomyopathy in children and to investigate clinical genetic testing practices. Methods and Results Children with familial or idiopathic cardiomyopathy were enrolled from 14 institutions in North America. Probands underwent exome sequencing. Rare sequence variants in 37 known cardiomyopathy genes were assessed for pathogenicity using consensus clinical interpretation guidelines. Of the 152 enrolled probands, 41% had a family history of cardiomyopathy. Of 81 (53%) who had undergone clinical genetic testing for cardiomyopathy before enrollment, 39 (48%) had a positive result. Genetic testing rates varied from 0% to 97% between sites. A positive family history and hypertrophic cardiomyopathy subtype were associated with increased likelihood of genetic testing (<i>P</i>=0.005 and <i>P</i>=0.03, respectively). A molecular cause was identified in an additional 21% of the 63 children who did not undergo clinical testing, with positive results identified in both familial and idiopathic cases and across all phenotypic subtypes. Conclusions A definitive molecular genetic diagnosis can be made in a substantial proportion of children for whom the cause and heritable nature of their cardiomyopathy was previously unknown. Practice variations in genetic testing are great and should be reduced. Improvements can be made in comprehensive cardiac screening and predictive genetic testing in first-degree relatives. Overall, our results support use of routine genetic testing in cases of both familial and idiopathic cardiomyopathy.

The present study analyzed >28.000 endometriosis‚Äërelated publications using data mining and semantic techniques aimed towards extracting the endometriosis‚Äërelated genes and SNPs. The extracted knowledge was filtered, evaluated, annotated, classified, and stored in the Demetra Application Database (DAD). Moreover, an updated gene regulatory network with the genes implements in endometriosis was established. This was followed by the design and development of the Demetra Application, in which the generated datasets and results were included. The application was tested and presented herein with whole‚Äëexome sequencing data from seven related patients with endometriosis. Endometriosis‚Äërelated SNPs and variants identified in genome‚Äëwide association studies (GWAS), whole‚Äëgenome (WGS), whole‚Äëexome (WES), or targeted sequencing information were classified, annotated and analyzed in a consolidated patient profile with clinical significance information. Probable genes associated with the patient's genomic profile were visualized using several graphs, including chromosome ideograms, statistic bars and regulatory networks through data mining studies with relative publications, in an effort to obtain a representative number of the most credible candidate genes and biological pathways associated with endometriosis. An evaluation analysis was performed on seven patients from a three‚Äëgeneration family with endometriosis. All the recognized gene variants that were previously considered to be associated with endometriosis were properly identified in the output profile per patient, and by comparing the results, novel findings emerged.

We recorded presenting characteristics and outcomes (death or organ support) up to 30 days. We categorised patients as early DNACPR (before or on the day of admission) or late/no DNACPR (no DNACPR or occurring after the day of admission). We undertook descriptive analysis comparing these groups and multivariable analysis to identify independent predictors of early DNACPR.<h4>Results</h4>We excluded 1249 with missing DNACPR data, and identified 3929/12748 (31%) with an early DNACPR decision. They had higher mortality (40.7% v 13.1%) and lower use of any organ support (11.6% v 15.7%), but received a range of organ support interventions, with some being used at rates comparable to those with late or no DNACPR (e.g. non-invasive ventilation 4.4% v 3.5%). On multivariable analysis, older age (p < 0.001), active malignancy (p < 0.001), chronic lung disease (p < 0.001), limited performance status (p < 0.001), and abnormal physiological variables were associated with increased recording of early DNACPR. Asian ethnicity was associated with reduced recording of early DNACPR (p = 0.001).<h4>Conclusions</h4>Early DNACPR decisions were associated with recognised predictors of adverse outcome, and were inversely associated with Asian ethnicity. Most people with an early DNACPR decision survived to 30 days and many received potentially life-saving interventions.<h4>Registration</h4>ISRCTN registry, ISRCTN28342533, http://www.isrctn.com/ISRCTN28342533.",hji,,0,0,1,0.0,,

However, studies on sIGF-1 among children from low-income countries are few, and the role of body composition is unknown.<h4>Objectives</h4>To assess the associations of anthropometry, body composition, inflammation, and breastfeeding with sIGF-1 among children with moderate acute malnutrition (MAM).<h4>Methods</h4>A cross-sectional study based on admission data from 6- to 23-mo-old children with MAM participating in a nutrition intervention trial (Treatfood) in Burkina Faso. Linear regression analysis was used to identify correlates of sIGF-1.<h4>Results</h4>Among 1546 children, the median (IQR) sIGF-1 was 12 (8.2-18.3) ng/mL. sIGF-1 was highest at 6 mo, with a nadir ‚àº10-11 mo, and higher in girls than boys. Length-for-age z score (LAZ), weight-for-length z score (WLZ), and midupper arm circumference were positively associated with sIGF-1 (P ‚â§ 0.001). Fat-free mass (FFM) was also positively associated, as sIGF-1 increased 1.5 (95% CI: 0.5, 2.5) ng/mL for each 1-kg increase in FFM. However, the association disappeared after adjustment for height. Elevated serum C-reactive protein and Œ±1-acid glycoprotein were negatively associated with sIGF-1 (P ‚â§ 0.001), as was fever (P < 0.001) but not a positive malaria test per se (P = 0.15). Children never breastfed had lower sIGF-1 (-5.1; 95% CI: -9.8, -0.3).<h4>Conclusions</h4>LAZ and WLZ were positively and inflammation negatively associated with sIGF-1. As all children were moderately malnourished and many had inflammation, this probably explains the very low median sIGF-1. The association of FFM with sIGF-1 was fully explained by height. There was a marked age pattern, with a nadir in late infancy, confirming findings from smaller studies from well-nourished populations.

Through differential proteomic analysis researchers can shed light on groups of proteins or individual proteins that play key roles in certain, normal or pathological conditions. However, several tools for the analysis of such complex datasets are powerful, but hard-to-use with steep learning curves. In addition, some other tools are easy to use, but are weak in terms of analytical power. Previously, we have introduced ProteoSign, a powerful, yet user-friendly open-source online platform for protein differential expression/abundance analysis designed with the end-proteomics user in mind. Part of Proteosign's power stems from the utilization of the well-established Linear Models For Microarray Data (LIMMA) methodology.

33964156,ptm: an R package for the study of methionine sulfoxidation and other post-translational modifications.,"<h4>Summary</h4>Methionine sulfoxidation is a post-translational modification playing important roles in cell signaling. Herein, we present ptm, an R package for the study of this modification. However, since many of the analyses applied to methionine modification can be extended to other modifications, the package can be useful to thoroughly analyze post-translational modifications in general. Thus, within a single software environment ptm can integrate information from up to 11 databases covering 9 modifications. Different functions can work coordinately to form pipelines allowing the programmatic analysis of thousands of proteins. Alternatively, the user can simultaneously perform different analyses on the same protein of interest, combining the results in a single output. The flexibility of ptm makes it a suitable tool to address site- and protein-centric hypotheses related to post-translational modifications. Accompanying the package we maintain a web page containing extended documentation and examples of the tasks that can be performed with ptm.<h4>Availability and implementation</h4>ptm is implemented in R.

33968730,The Immune-Related Gene HCST as a Novel Biomarker for the Diagnosis and Prognosis of Clear Cell Renal Cell Carcinoma.,"Clear cell renal cell carcinoma (ccRCC) is the most common type of kidney tumor worldwide. Analysis of The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) and Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) databases showed that the immune-related gene (IRG) hematopoietic cell signal transducer (HCST) could provide guidance for the diagnosis, prognosis, and treatment of ccRCC. The RNA-seq data of ccRCC tissues were extracted from two databases: TCGA (https://www.cancer.gov/about-nci/organization/ccg/research/structural-genomics/tcga) and GEO (https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/). Corresponding clinical information was downloaded from TCGA. Immune-related gene data were extracted from the IMMPORT website (https://www.immport.org/). Differential analysis with R software (https://www.r-project.org/) was used to obtain a prognosis model of ccRCC IRGs. The differences were combined with the clinical data to assess the usefulness of the HCST as a prognostic biomarker. Based on data obtained from the Oncomine (https://www.oncomine.org/), Human Protein Atlas (https://www.proteinatlas.org/), and PubMed (https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/) databases, the expression levels of the HCST in ccRCC, clinical-pathological indicators of relevance, and influence on prognosis were analyzed. Regulation of the HCST gene in ccRCC was assessed by gene set enrichment analysis (GSEA). In TCGA/GEO databases, the high HCST expression in tumor tissues was significantly correlated to the TMN stage, tumor grade, invasion depth, and lymphatic metastasis (<i>p</i> < 0.05). The overall survival (OS) of patients with high HCST gene expression was significantly lower than that of patients with low HCST gene expression (<i>p</i> < 0.001). Multivariate Cox regression analysis suggested that the HCST expression level [hazard ratio (HR) = 1.630, 95% confidence interval (CI) = 1.042-2.552], tumor cell grade (HR = 1.829, 95% CI = 1.115-3.001), and distant metastasis (HR = 2.634, 95%, CI = 1.562-4.442) were independent risk factors affecting the OS of ccRCC patients (all, <i>p</i> < 0.05). The GSEA study showed that there was significant enrichment in cell adhesion, tumorigenesis, and immune and inflammatory responses in HCST high expression samples. Hematopoietic cell signal transducer expression was closely associated with the levels of infiltrating immune cells around ccRCC tissues, especially dendritic cells (DCs). In conclusion, the present study suggested that the HCST was interrelated to the clinicopathology and poor prognosis of ccRCC. High HCST expression was also closely correlated with the levels of tumor-infiltrating immune cells, especially DCs.",hji,,0,0,1,0.0,,not descpritive of resource
33970805,Medicinal plant compounds as promising inhibitors of coronavirus (COVID-19) main protease: an <i>in silico</i> study.,"The novel Coronavirus (COVID-19) has spread rapidly across the globe and has involved more than 215 countries and territories. Due to a lack of effective therapy or vaccine, urgent and concerted efforts are needed to identify therapeutic targets and medications. COVID-19 main protease represents a major target for drug treatment to inhibit viral function. The present study sought to evaluate medicinal plant compounds as potential inhibitors of the COVID-19 main protease using molecular docking and molecular dynamic analysis. The PDB files of COVID-19 main protease and some medicinal plant compounds were retrieved from the Protein Data Bank (http://www.rcsb.org) and Pubchem server, respectively. The Gromacs software was used for simulation studies, and molecular docking analysis was done using Autodock 4.2. The COVID-19 main protease simulation, compared with some phytochemicals docked to the COVID-19 main protease, were analyzed. Glabridin, catechin, and fisetin had the greatest tendency to interact with the COVID-19 main protease by hydrogen and hydrophobic interactions. Docking of these phytochemicals to COVID-19 main protease led to an increase in the radius of gyration (Rg), decrease in the Root mean square fluctuation (RMSF), and induced variation in COVID-19 main protease secondary structure. The high tendency interaction of glabridin, catechin, and fisetin to COVID-19 main protease induced conformational changes on this enzyme. These interactions can lead to enzyme inhibition. This simulated study indicates that these phytochemicals may be considered as potent inhibitors of the viral protease; however, more investigations are required to explore their potential medicinal use.Communicated by Ramaswamy H.

33970835,"""Just Engage in It or Not, You Get Out What You Put In"": Student and Staff Experiences of Feedback and Feedforward in Workplace-Based Learning Environments.","Feedback is central to student learning in the veterinary workplace. Feedforward, a related concept, is used to describe the way information about a student's performance may be used to improve their future performance. Feedback and feedforward practices are diverse, with varied student and staff understandings of the nature and purpose of feedback (feedback literacy). This study compared the practices of feedback and feedforward in a range of programs in one institution during student transitions from the classroom to workplace-based learning environments. The study adopted a broad inter-professional approach to include health care programs as well as social work and theater and performance studies. Profession-specific focus groups were conducted with contribution from 28 students and 31 staff from five different professions. Thematic analysis revealed that students and staff shared an understanding of the feedback and feedforward concepts, and both groups recognized the importance of emotional and relational aspects of the process. Students and staff across all professions recognized the impact of time constraints on the feedback process, although this was particularly highlighted in the health science professions. Social work and theater and performance studies students demonstrated a more nuanced understanding of the emotional and relational aspects of feedback and feedforward. Overall, the approach highlights similarities and differences in practices and experiences in different workplace contexts, creating opportunities for cross-disciplinary learning, which may have relevance more widely in higher education programs with workplace-based elements. The study underpinned the development of the LeapForward feedback training resource (https://bilt.online/the-leapforward-project/).",hji,,0,0,1,0.0,,not life sci
33972020,REP2: A Web Server to Detect Common Tandem Repeats in Protein Sequences.,"Ensembles of tandem repeats (TRs) in protein sequences expand rapidly to form domains well suited for interactions with proteins. For this reason, they are relatively frequent. Some TRs have known structures and therefore it is advantageous to predict their presence in a protein sequence. However, since most TRs diverge quickly, their detection by classical sequence comparison algorithms is not very accurate. Previously, we developed a method and a web server that used curated profiles and thresholds for the detection of 11 common TRs. Here we present a new web server (REP2) that allows the analysis of TRs in both individual and aligned sequences. We provide currently precomputed analyses for a selection of 78 UniProt reference proteomes. We illustrate how these data can be used to study the evolution of TRs using comparative genomics.

33981815,A spatiotemporal dataset for integrated assessment and modelling of crop-livestock integration with the MAELIA simulation platform.,"The general purpose of the primary and secondary data available in this article is to support an integrated assessment of scenarios of crop-livestock integration at the territorial level i.e. of exchanges between arable and livestock farms. The data is a result of a research collaboration between the scientist from INRAE, agricultural advisers from Chamber of Agriculture of Pays de la Loire (CRAPL) and a collective of five arable and two livestock farmers located in the district of Pays de Pouzauges (Vend√©e department, western France). All participants formed part of the DiverIMPACTS project (https://www.diverimpacts.net/) that aims to achieve the full potential of diversification of cropping systems for improved productivity, delivery of ecosystem services and resource-efficient and sustainable value chains in Europe. The first dataset corresponds to the inputs of MAELIA (http://maelia-platform.inra.fr/), a spatial agent-based simulation platform that was used to support an iterative design and assessment of scenarios to redesign cropping systems. The second dataset corresponds to the outputs of MAELIA simulations and the associated indicators at the farm, group and territory level. The data comprise multiple shape and csv files characterizing the edaphic-climatic heterogeneity of the territory and cropping systems, farmers' crop management rules (IF-THEN rules) and general information about the farms (e.g. crops, agricultural equipment, average crop yields). Data is reported for the baseline situation and three exchange scenarios containing different innovative cropping systems co-designed by scientists, agricultural advisers and the farmers. The data presented here can be found in the Portail Data INRA repository (https://doi.org/10.15454/3ZTCF5) and were used in the research article ""Fostering local crop-livestock integration via legume exchanges using an innovative integrated assessment and modelling approach: MAELIA"" [1].",hji,,0,0,1,0.0,,

Diminished rectal sensation (rectal hyposensitivity [RH]) is associated with constipation, although its clinical importance remains unclear.<h4>Methods</h4>Consecutive patients (aged 18-80) attending a tertiary center (2004-2016) for investigation of refractory functional constipation (Rome IV core criteria defined, applied post hoc) were included. Patients completed a clinical symptom questionnaire and underwent anorectal physiologic investigations, including rectal sensory testing (balloon distension) to determine 3 well-established sensory thresholds. Multivariate regression analyses were performed to evaluate associations between RH, symptomology, and allied physiologic investigations.<h4>Results</h4>Of 2,876 patients meeting inclusion criteria, 722 (25%) had RH based on ‚â•1 elevated sensory thresholds (0: n = 2,154 [74.9%]; 1: n = 327 [11.4%]; 2: n = 209 [7.3%]; and 3: n = 186 [6.5%]). A linear relationship existed between increasing number of elevated sensory thresholds and constipation severity (Cleveland Clinic constipation score: mean difference per threshold [95% confidence interval] 0.69 [0.48-0.90]; P < 0.001). Several symptoms were significantly (P < 0.05) associated with RH including: infrequent defecation (odds ratio 1.29 [1.17-1.42]), painful evacuation (1.15 [1.05-1.27]), prolonged toileting (1.14 [1.05-1.24]), and digitation or enema use (1.18 [1.08-1.30]). On defecography, a ""functional"" evacuation disorder was also associated with RH (1.37 [1.25-1.50], P < 0.001), as was megarectum (2.52 [2.08-3.05], P < 0.001).<h4>Discussion</h4>RH occurs in 25% of patients with refractory functional constipation. Increased number of elevated sensory thresholds is associated with more severe constipation phenotype. These data, in the largest study to date, provide for the first time evidence to show that RH is a major pathophysiologic mechanism in constipation, with recognized clinical impact (http://links.lww.com/AJG/B765).(Equation is included in full-text article.).",hji,,0,0,1,0.0,,

However, available benchmarks show that all next-generation sequencing (NGS) CNV calling tools produce false positives. We developed CNVfilteR, an R package that uses the single nucleotide variant calls usually obtained in germline NGS pipelines to identify those false positives. The package can detect both false deletions and false duplications. We evaluated CNVfilteR performance on callsets generated by 13 CNV calling tools on 3 whole-genome sequencing and 541 panel samples, showing a decrease of up to 44.8% in false positives and consistent F1-score increase. Using CNVfilteR to detect false-positive calls can improve the overall performance of existing CNV calling pipelines.<h4>Availability</h4>CNVfilteR is released under Artistic-2.0 License.

33997237,Comparative proteomics of <i>Brucella melitensis</i> is a useful toolbox for developing prophylactic interventions in a One-Health context.,"Brucellosis caused by <i>Brucella melitensis</i> is a zoonosis frequently reported in the Mediterranean and Middle-East regions and responsible for important economic losses and reduced animal welfare. To date, current strategies applied to control or eradicate the disease relies on diagnostic tests that suffer from limited specificity in non-vaccinated animals; while prophylactic measures, when applied, use a live attenuated bacterial strain characterized by residual virulence on adult pregnant animals and difficulties in distinguishing vaccinated from infected animals. To overcome these issues, studies are desired to elucidate the bacterial biology and the pathogenetic mechanisms of both the vaccinal strain and the pathogenic strains. Proteomics has a potential in tackling issues of One-Health concern; here, we employed label-free shotgun proteomics to investigate the protein repertoire of the vaccinal strain <i>B. melitensis</i> Rev.1 and compare it with the proteome of the <i>Brucella melitensis</i> 16 M, a reference strain representative of <i>B. melitensis</i> field strains. Comparative proteomics profiling underlines common and diverging traits between the two strains. Common features suggest the potential biochemical routes responsible for the residual virulence of the vaccinal strain, whilst the diverging traits are suggestive biochemical signatures to be further investigated to provide an optimized diagnostic capable of discriminating the vaccinated from infected animals.

33999180,OpenAnnotate: a web server to annotate the chromatin accessibility of genomic regions.,"Chromatin accessibility, as a powerful marker of active DNA regulatory elements, provides valuable information for understanding regulatory mechanisms. The revolution in high-throughput methods has accumulated massive chromatin accessibility profiles in public repositories. Nevertheless, utilization of these data is hampered by cumbersome collection, time-consuming processing, and manual chromatin accessibility (openness) annotation of genomic regions. To fill this gap, we developed OpenAnnotate (http://health.tsinghua.edu.cn/openannotate/) as the first web server for efficiently annotating openness of massive genomic regions across various biosample types, tissues, and biological systems. In addition to the annotation resource from 2729 comprehensive profiles of 614 biosample types of human and mouse, OpenAnnotate provides user-friendly functionalities, ultra-efficient calculation, real-time browsing, intuitive visualization, and elaborate application notebooks. We show its unique advantages compared to existing databases and toolkits by effectively revealing cell type-specificity, identifying regulatory elements and 3D chromatin contacts, deciphering gene functional relationships, inferring functions of transcription factors, and unprecedentedly promoting single-cell data analyses. We anticipate OpenAnnotate will provide a promising avenue for researchers to construct a more holistic perspective to understand regulatory mechanisms.",hji,,0,0,1,0.0,,

Although the number of hospital patients using interventions such as the video consultation has increased in recent years only a small proportion of the outpatient and inpatient visits involve telemedicine. The TELEMED database (https://telemedicine.cimt.dk/) has been launched at the Center for Innovative Medical Technology in Denmark to ensure that hospital managers and healthcare professionals have access to information about telemedicine services and their effectiveness. This article describes the development and the content of the TELEMED database.<h4>Methods</h4>A structured literature search was made in the PubMed Database for randomised controlled trials or observational studies with a control group that investigated the effect of telemedicine interventions for hospital patients. Data were extracted from each article on the clinical effectiveness, patient perceptions, economic effects and implementation challenges. As the database should only provide inspiration to healthcare professionals regarding possibilities for use of telemedicine, the risk of bias in the studies was not assessed.<h4>Results</h4>The literature search resulted in 2825 hits. Based on full text assessment, 331 articles were included for data extraction and assessment. These articles present telemedicine services used in 22 different medical specialities. Forty-eight percent of the studies found a positive, statistically significant clinical effect, while 47% showed no statistically significant difference. In 48% of the studies, patients' experiences were examined and of these 68% found positive patient experiences. Fifty-four percent of the articles included information on the economic effects and, of these, 51% found reduction in healthcare utilization. In the majority of studies between two and four types of implementation challenges were found.<b>Conclusions and recommendations:</b> The TELEMED database provides an easily accessible overview of existing evidence-based telemedicine services for use by hospital managers and health professionals, who whish to to implement telemedicine.

34004273,Klebsiella MALDI TypeR: a web-based tool for Klebsiella identification based on MALDI-TOF mass spectrometry.,"Klebsiella pathogens affect human and animal health and are widely distributed in the environment. Among these, the Klebsiella pneumoniae species complex, which includes seven phylogroups, is an important cause of community and hospital infections. The Klebsiella oxytoca species complex also causes hospital infections and antibiotic-associated haemorrhagic colitis. The unsuitability of currently used clinical microbiology methods to distinguish species within each of these species complexes leads to high rates of misidentifications that are masking the true clinical significance and potential epidemiological specificities of individual species. We developed a web-based tool, Klebsiella MALDI TypeR, a platform-independent and user-friendly application that enables uploading MALDI-TOF mass spectrometry data in order to identify Klebsiella isolates at the species complex and phylogroup levels. The tool, available at https://maldityper.pasteur.fr/, leverages a database of previously identified biomarkers that are specific for species complexes, individual phylogroups, or related phylogroups. We obtained 84%-100% identification accuracy depending on phylogroup. Identification results are obtained in a few seconds from batches of uploaded spectral data. Klebsiella MALDI TypeR enables fast and reliable identification of Klebsiella strains that are often misidentified with standard microbiological methods.

The extent to which low levels of smoke exposure among nonsmoking pregnant women relates to offspring DNA methylation is unknown.<h4>Objective</h4>This study sought to evaluate relationships between maternal prenatal plasma cotinine levels and DNA methylation in umbilical cord blood in newborns using the Infinium HumanMethylation 450K BeadChip.<h4>Methods</h4>Participants from the Newborn Epigenetics Study cohort who reported not smoking during pregnancy had verified low levels of cotinine from maternal prenatal plasma (0 ng/mL to <4‚Äâng/mL), and offspring epigenetic data from umbilical cord blood were included in this study (n=79). Multivariable linear regression models were fit to the data, controlling for cell proportions, age, race, education, and parity. Estimates represent changes in response to any 1-ng/mL unit increase in exposure.<h4>Results</h4>Multivariable linear regression models yielded 29,049 CpGs that were differentially methylated in relation to increases in cotinine at a 5% false discovery rate. Top CpGs were within or near genes involved in neuronal functioning (<i>PRKG1</i>, <i>DLGAP2</i>, <i>BSG</i>), carcinogenesis (<i>FHIT</i>, <i>HSPC157</i>) and inflammation (<i>AGER</i>). Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) analyses suggest cotinine was related to methylation of gene pathways controlling neuronal signaling, metabolic regulation, cell signaling and regulation, and cancer. Further, enhancers associated with transcription start sites were enriched in altered CpGs. Using an independent sample from the same study population (n=115), bisulfite pyrosequencing was performed with infant cord blood DNA for two genes within our top 20 hits (<i>AGER</i> and <i>PRKG1</i>). Results from pyrosequencing replicated epigenome results for <i>PRKG1</i> (cg17079497, estimate=-1.09, standard error‚Äâ(SE)=0.45, p=0.018) but not for AGER (cg09199225; estimate=-0.16, SE=0.21, p=0.44).<h4>Discussion</h4>Secondhand smoke exposure among nonsmoking women may alter DNA methylation in regions involved in development, carcinogenesis, and neuronal functioning. These novel findings suggest that even low levels of smoke exposure during pregnancy may be sufficient to alter DNA methylation in distinct sites of mixed umbilical cord blood leukocytes in pathways that are known to be altered in cord blood from pregnant active smokers. https://doi.org/10.1289/EHP8099.",hji,,0,0,1,0.0,,
34012710,A Comparison of Methods for Studying the Tumor Microenvironment's Spatial Heterogeneity in Digital Pathology Specimens.,"<h4>Background</h4>The tumor microenvironment is highly heterogeneous, and it is understood to affect tumor progression and patient outcome. A number of studies have reported the prognostic significance of tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes and tumor budding in colorectal cancer (CRC). However, the significance of the intratumoral heterogeneity present in the spatial distribution of these features within the tumor immune microenvironment (TIME) has not been previously reported. Evaluating this intratumoral heterogeneity may aid the understanding of the TIME's effect on patient prognosis as well as identify novel aggressive phenotypes which can be further investigated as potential targets for new treatment.<h4>Methods</h4>In this study, we propose and apply two spatial statistical methodologies for the evaluation of the intratumor heterogeneity present in the distribution of CD3 <sup>+</sup> and CD8 <sup>+</sup> lymphocytes and tumor buds (TB) in 232 Stage II CRC cases. Getis-Ord hotspot analysis was applied to quantify the cold and hotspots, defined as regions with a significantly low or high number of each feature of interest, respectively. A novel spatial heatmap methodology for the quantification of the cold and hotspots of each feature of interest, which took into account both the interpatient heterogeneity and the intratumor heterogeneity, was further developed.<h4>Results</h4>Resultant data from each analysis, characterizing the spatial intratumor heterogeneity of lymphocytes and TBs were used for the development of two new highly prognostic risk models.<h4>Conclusions</h4>Our results highlight the value of applying spatial statistics for the assessment of the intratumor heterogeneity. Both Getis-Ord hotspot and our proposed spatial heatmap analysis are broadly applicable across other tissue types as well as other features of interest.<h4>Availability</h4>The code underpinning this publication can be accessed at https://doi.org/10.17630/c2306fe9-66e2-4442-ad89-f986220053e2.",hji,,0,0,1,0.0,,

34019776,Conducting a Virtual Study With Special Considerations for Working With Persons With Aphasia.,"Purpose The use of technology (e.g., telehealth) in clinical settings has rapidly increased, and its use in research settings continues to grow. The aim of this report is to present one potential solution to a clinical issue that of virtual and remote assessment for the purposes of spoken language research in persons with aphasia (PWA). To do so, we report detailed methods for conducting a multitimepoint (test-retest) virtual paradigm, assessing lifestyle, physiological, cognitive, and linguistic factors in persons with and without aphasia. Method Procedures for virtual assessment are detailed in a sample of adults with no brain damage (<i>N</i> = 24) and PWA (<i>N</i> = 25) on a test-retest paradigm (data collection approximately 10 ¬± 3 days apart). This report provides practical information about pre-assessment (e.g., recruitment, scheduling), assessment (e.g., aphasia-friendly consent presentation, investigator fidelity), and postassessment (e.g., data storage, quality check) procedures for human behavior research using a virtual platform. Results Preliminary study data are provided, indicating high retention rates, high rates of data acquisition, and feasibility. Common technological troubles and solutions are discussed, and solutions are offered. The results suggest that our pre-assessment, assessment, and postassessment procedures contributed to the success of our study. Conclusions We provide a practical methodology for conducting a multitimepoint study, with considerations for PWA, adding to the body of research on telehealth in clinical populations. Future studies should continue to evaluate telemethodology, which may be core for diversifying studies, improving study retention, and enrolling larger sample sizes.

34020445,Effect on gut microbiota of a 1-y lifestyle intervention with Mediterranean diet compared with energy-reduced Mediterranean diet and physical activity promotion: PREDIMED-Plus Study.,"<h4>Background</h4>The Mediterranean diet is a well-recognized healthy diet that has shown to induce positive changes in gut microbiota. Lifestyle changes such as diet along with physical activity could aid in weight loss and improve cardiovascular risk factors.<h4>Objectives</h4>To investigate the effect of an intensive lifestyle weight loss intervention on gut microbiota.<h4>Methods</h4>This is a substudy of the PREDIMED-Plus (Prevenci√≥n con Dieta Mediterr√°nea-Plus), a randomized controlled trial conducted in overweight/obese men and women (aged 55-75 y) with metabolic syndrome. The intervention group (IG) underwent an intensive weight loss lifestyle intervention based on an energy-restricted Mediterranean diet (MedDiet) and physical activity promotion, and the control group (CG) underwent a non-energy-restricted MedDiet for 1 y. Anthropometric, biochemical, and gut microbial 16S rRNA sequencing data were analyzed at baseline (n = 362) and 1-y follow-up (n = 343).<h4>Results</h4>IG participants had a weight loss of 4.2 (IQR, -6.8, -2.5) kg compared with 0.2 (IQR, -2.1, 1.4) kg in the CG (P < 0.001). Reductions in BMI, fasting glucose, glycated hemoglobin, and triglycerides and an increase in HDL cholesterol were greater in IG than in CG participants (P < 0.05). We observed a decrease in Butyricicoccus, Haemophilus, Ruminiclostridium 5, and Eubacterium hallii in the IG compared with the CG. Many genera shifted in the same direction within both intervention groups, indicating an overall effect of the MedDiet. Decreases in Haemophilus, Coprococcus 3, and few other genera were associated with a decrease in adiposity parameters in both intervention groups. Changes in Lachnospiraceae NK4A136 were positively associated with changes in MedDiet adherence.<h4>Conclusions</h4>Weight loss induced by an energy-restricted MedDiet and physical activity induce changes in gut microbiota. The role of MedDiet-induced changes on the host might be via short-chain fatty acid producing bacteria, whereas with energy restriction, these changes might be modulated with other mechanisms, which need to be explored in future studies.

34023895,LigAdvisor: a versatile and user-friendly web-platform for drug design.,"Although several tools facilitating in silico drug design are available, their results are usually difficult to integrate with publicly available information or require further processing to be fully exploited. The rational design of multi-target ligands (polypharmacology) and the repositioning of known drugs towards unmet therapeutic needs (drug repurposing) have raised increasing attention in drug discovery, although they usually require careful planning of tailored drug design strategies. Computational tools and data-driven approaches can help to reveal novel valuable opportunities in these contexts, as they enable to efficiently mine publicly available chemical, biological, clinical, and disease-related data. Based on these premises, we developed LigAdvisor, a data-driven webserver which integrates information reported in DrugBank, Protein Data Bank, UniProt, Clinical Trials and Therapeutic Target Database into an intuitive platform, to facilitate drug discovery tasks as drug repurposing, polypharmacology, target fishing and profiling. As designed, LigAdvisor enables easy integration of similarity estimation results with clinical data, thereby allowing a more efficient exploitation of information in different drug discovery contexts. Users can also develop customizable drug design tasks on their own molecules, by means of ligand- and target-based search modes, and download their results.

34025412,The Genus <i>Eriosema</i> (Fabaceae): From the Ethnopharmacology to an Evidence-Based Phytotherapeutic Perspective?,"The genus <i>Eriosema</i> (Fabaceae) includes approximately 150 species widely distributed across tropical and subtropical regions of the world (Africa, Neotropics, Asia and Australia). Throughout these regions, several species are used since centuries in different traditional medicinal systems, while others are used as food or food supplement. The present review attempts to critically summarize current information concerning the uses, phytochemistry and pharmacology of the <i>Eriosema</i> genus and to evaluate the therapeutic potential. The information published in English and French (up to September 2020) on ethnopharmacology or traditional uses, chemistry, pharmacology and toxicology of <i>Eriosema</i> genus was collected from electronic databases [SciFinder, PubMed, Google, Google Scholar, Scopus, Web of Science, Prelude Medicinal Plants-http://www.ethnopharmacologia.org/recherche-dans-prelude/?plant, The Plant List (http://www.theplantlist.org/), POWO (http://powo.science.kew.org/) and IUCN Red List Categories (https://www.iucnredlist.org/)], conference proceedings, books, M.Sc. and Ph.D. dissertations. The information retrieved on the ethnomedicinal indications of <i>Eriosema</i> genus allowed to list 25 species (‚àº16.6% of the genus). The majority of uses is recorded from Africa. Phytochemical analyses of 8 species led to the identification and/or isolation of 107 compounds, with flavonoids (69.2%), chromones (7.5%) and benzoic acid derivatives (3.7%) as the main chemical classes. Pharmacological investigations with crude extracts and isolated compounds showed a broad range of activities including aphrodisiac, estrogenic, anti-osteoporosis, hypolipidemic, anti-diabetic, anti-diarrheal, anti-microbial, anti-oxidant, anthelmintic, anti-cancer, and acetylcholinesterase inhibitory activities. Despite the low number of <i>Eriosema</i> species tested, there is convincing evidence in <i>vitro</i> and <i>in vivo</i> studies validating some traditional and ethnobotanical uses. However, the utility of several of the described uses has not yet been confirmed in pharmacological studies. Reviewed data could serve as a reference tool and preliminary information for advanced research on <i>Eriosema</i> species.",hji,,0,0,1,0.0,,not descriptive of the resource
34034357,Talking about post-injury sexual functioning: The views of people with spinal cord injuries-A qualitative interview study.,"<h4>Aim</h4>This study aimed to explore perceptions of people with spinal cord injuries regarding the information they received during their rehabilitation programme on post-injury sexual functioning.<h4>Background</h4>Spinal cord injury is a traumatic, life-altering event that is associated with loss of motor and sensory function and sexual impairment. Existing evidence suggests that sexual issues are poorly handled during the rehabilitation phase of the patient's journey.<h4>Design</h4>A descriptive qualitative design was utilized in this study.<h4>Methods</h4>Twenty-nine people with spinal cord injury participated in qualitative in-depth interviews between November 2017 and April 2018, and data were analysed using the Burnard (1991, https://doi.org/10.1016/0260-6917(91)90009-y) thematic analysis framework.<h4>Results</h4>Some participants indicated they were sexually inactive prior to their spinal cord injury. They testified that they had not received information on post-injury sexual functioning. Many participants who received post-injury information on sexual functioning reported dissatisfaction with the content and timing of this information.<h4>Conclusion</h4>Personal conversations between spinal cord injured patients and dedicated members of the interdisciplinary health team can enhance the quality of rehabilitation care and patients' satisfaction with rehabilitation care. Nurses are central clinicians in the rehabilitation programme of spinal cord injured patients and should engage in individually designed conversations about post-injury sexual functioning.",hji,,0,0,1,0.0,,
34037798,CPA: a web-based platform for consensus pathway analysis and interactive visualization.,"In molecular biology and genetics, there is a large gap between the ease of data collection and our ability to extract knowledge from these data. Contributing to this gap is the fact that living organisms are complex systems whose emerging phenotypes are the results of multiple complex interactions taking place on various pathways. This demands powerful yet user-friendly pathway analysis tools to translate the now abundant high-throughput data into a better understanding of the underlying biological phenomena. Here we introduce Consensus Pathway Analysis (CPA), a web-based platform that allows researchers to (i) perform pathway analysis using eight established methods (GSEA, GSA, FGSEA, PADOG, Impact Analysis, ORA/Webgestalt, KS-test, Wilcox-test), (ii) perform meta-analysis of multiple datasets, (iii) combine methods and datasets to accurately identify the impacted pathways underlying the studied condition and (iv) interactively explore impacted pathways, and browse relationships between pathways and genes. The platform supports three types of input: (i) a list of differentially expressed genes, (ii) genes and fold changes and (iii) an expression matrix. It also allows users to import data from NCBI GEO. The CPA platform currently supports the analysis of multiple organisms using KEGG and Gene Ontology, and it is freely available at http://cpa.tinnguyen-lab.com.",hji,,0,0,1,0.0,,
34038112,CyProduct: A Software Tool for Accurately Predicting the Byproducts of Human Cytochrome P450 Metabolism.,"<i>In silico</i> metabolism prediction is a cheminformatic task of autonomously predicting the set of metabolic byproducts produced from a specified molecule and a set of enzymes or reactions. Here, we describe a novel machine learned <i>in silico</i> cytochrome P450 (CYP450) metabolism prediction suite, called CyProduct, that accurately predicts metabolic byproducts for a specified molecule and a human CYP450 isoform. It includes three modules: (1) CypReact, a tool that predicts if the query compound reacts with a given CYP450 enzyme, (2) CypBoM, a tool that accurately predicts the ""bond site"" of the reaction (i.e., which specific bonds within the query molecule react with the CYP isoform), and (3) MetaboGen, a tool that generates the metabolic byproducts based on CypBoM's bond-site prediction. CyProduct predicts metabolic biotransformation products for each of the nine most important human CYP450 enzymes. CypBoM uses an important new concept called ""bond of metabolism"" (BoM), which extends the traditional ""site of metabolism"" (SoM) by specifying the information about the set of chemical <i>bonds</i> that is modified or formed in a metabolic reaction (rather than the specific atom). We created a BoM database for 1845 CYP450-mediated Phase I reactions, then used this to train the CypBoM Predictor to predict the reactive bond locations on substrate molecules. CypBoM Predictor's cross-validated Jaccard score for reactive bond prediction ranged from 0.380 to 0.452 over the nine CYP450 enzymes. Over variants of a test set of 68 known CYP450 substrates and 30 nonreactants, CyProduct outperformed the other packages, including ADMET Predictor, BioTransformer, and GLORY, by an average of 200% (with respect to Jaccard score) in terms of predicting metabolites.

34038548,Estimage: a webserver hub for the computation of methylation age.,"Methylage is an epigenetic marker of biological age that exploits the correlation between the methylation state of specific CG dinucleotides (CpGs) and chronological age (in years), gestational age (in weeks), cellular age (in cell cycles or as telomere length, in kilobases). Using DNA methylation data, methylage is measurable via the so called epigenetic clocks. Importantly, alterations of the correlation between methylage and age (age acceleration or deceleration) have been stably associated with pathological states and occur long before clinical signs of diseases become overt, making epigenetic clocks a potentially disruptive tool in preventive, diagnostic and also in forensic applications. Nevertheless, methylage dependency from CpGs selection, mathematical modelling, tissue specificity and age range, still makes the potential of this biomarker limited. In order to enhance model comparisons, interchange, availability, robustness and standardization, we organized a selected set of clocks within a hub webservice, EstimAge (Estimate of methylation Age, http://estimage.iac.rm.cnr.it), which intuitively and informatively enables quick identification, computation and comparison of available clocks, with the support of standard statistics.",hji,,0,0,1,0.0,,

Computer programs that analyze NGS data obtained from a mapping population of individuals derived from a mutant of interest to identify a causal mutation are available; however, the installation and usage of such programs requires bioinformatic skills, modifying or combining pieces of existing software, or purchasing licenses. To ease this process, we developed Easymap, an open-source program that simplifies the data analysis workflows from raw NGS reads to candidate mutations. Easymap can perform bulked segregant mapping of point mutations induced by ethyl methanesulfonate (EMS) with DNA-seq or RNA-seq datasets, as well as tagged-sequence mapping for large insertions, such as transposons or T-DNAs. The mapping analyses implemented in Easymap have been validated with experimental and simulated datasets from different plant and animal model species. Easymap was designed to be accessible to all users regardless of their bioinformatics skills by implementing a user-friendly graphical interface, a simple universal installation script, and detailed mapping reports, including informative images and complementary data for assessment of the mapping results. Easymap is available at http://genetics.edu.umh.es/resources/easymap; its Quickstart Installation Guide details the recommended procedure for installation.",hji,,0,0,1,0.0,,

We then reanalyze data (n‚Äâ=‚Äâ4,244) previously examined by Richardson et al. (Evolutionary Psychology, 15(1), 2017, https://doi.org/10.1177/1474704916666840 to determine whether (a) previously reported evidence of multidimensionality is robust to the modeling approach employed and (b) the structure of LH indicators is invariant by sex. Findings provide further evidence that a single LH dimension is implausible and that researchers should cease interpreting K-factor scores as empirical proxies for LH speed. In contrast to the original study, we detected a small inverse correlation between mating competition and Super-K that is consistent with a trade-off. Tests of measurement invariance across the sexes revealed evidence of metric invariance (i.e., equivalence of factor loadings), consistent with the theory that K is a proximate cause of its indicators; however, evidence of partial scalar invariance suggests use of scores likely introduces bias when the sexes are compared. We discuss limitations and identify approaches that researchers may use to further evaluate the validity of the K-factor and other applications of LH to human variation.",hji,,0,0,1,0.0,,

Atomistic structural details of protein-protein interactions may provide important information that can facilitate the design of therapeutic agents. GalaxyHeteromer is a freely available automatic web server (http://galaxy.seoklab.org/heteromer) that predicts protein heterodimer complex structures from two subunit protein sequences or structures. When subunit structures are unavailable, they are predicted by template- or distance-prediction-based modelling methods. Heterodimer complex structures can be predicted by both template-based and ab initio docking, depending on the template's availability. Structural templates are detected from the protein structure database based on both the sequence and structure similarities. The templates for heterodimers may be selected from monomer and homo-oligomer structures, as well as from hetero-oligomers, owing to the evolutionary relationships of heterodimers with domains of monomers or subunits of homo-oligomers. In addition, the server employs one of the best ab initio docking methods when heterodimer templates are unavailable. The multiple heterodimer structure models and the associated scores, which are provided by the web server, may be further examined by user to test or develop functional hypotheses or to design new functional molecules.",hji,,0,0,1,0.0,,

34058399,BA-plotteR - A web tool for generating Bland-Altman plots and constructing limits of agreement.,"Investigators use Bland-Altman plot (Limits of Agreement plot) to compare two methods measuring the same continuous variable to determine interchangeability or agreement of the methods. The method has evolved to deal with heteroscedastic data and fixed or proportional biases (or both). Although an ordinary Bland-Altman plot can be readily made with various software applications, there is no free, open-source application that is dedicated to producing Bland-Altman plots and constructing limits of agreement for data that do not meet the assumptions of a simple comparison. To fill this gap, we created BA-plotteR, a web-based, open-source, freeware tool created in Shiny/R that is dedicated to creating Bland-Altman plots. We validated the tool using 20 datasets with various data distributions by comparing the output from the tool against manually derived results. The webtool handles data that requires a more complex analysis than is commonly available through commercial statistical programs. Moreover, the automated analysis of the data distribution will guide users and help them to correctly plot and analyse their data. The tool agreed perfectly with manually constructed plots.

The aim of this research is to assess whether the use of sedation can help improve the detection rate of UGI EC and precancerous lesions. The second objective is to evaluate its potential influencing factors.<h4>Methods</h4>The study includes 432,202 patients from a multicenter database from January 2012 to July 2019. Information on endoscopic findings and histology biopsies was obtained from endoscopy quality-control system. Associations of sedation with the detection rate of EC and precancerous lesions were assessed.<h4>Results</h4>The sedation group has a higher detection rate of UGI EC and HGIN compared with the no-sedation group, whereas the detection rate of low-grade intraepithelial neoplasia was similar between the 2 groups. There were more cases examined by using staining, image enhancement, or magnifying techniques in the sedation group (P < 0.001). And, the mean observation time was also longer in the sedation group (P < 0.001). The type 0-IIb esophageal HGIN and EC cases were significantly increased in the sedation group. No significant difference was detected on lesion subtypes for gastric HGIN and EC according to the Paris classification. More gastric HGIN and EC were detected at gastric body in the sedation group (P = 0.001).<h4>Discussion</h4>Sedation may improve the endoscopic detection rate of EC and HGIN in the UGI tract probably through enhancing the use of accessary endoscopic techniques, prolonging observation time, and taking more biopsies in different locations (see Visual Abstract, Supplementary Digital Content 2, http://links.lww.com/AJG/B926).",hji,,0,0,1,0.0,,

In a secondary analysis of randomized trial data, the authors compared the efficacy of the PREPARE for Your Care (PREPARE) website plus an easy-to-read advance directive (AD) with an AD only among older adults with and without cancer.<h4>Methods</h4>Safety net, primary care patients in San Francisco were included if they were 55 years old or older, were English- or Spanish-speaking, and had 2 or more chronic conditions. The authors determined cancer diagnoses by using International Classification of Diseases, Ninth Revision/Tenth Revision codes. The primary outcome was new ACP documentation in the medical record at 15 months; the secondary outcomes were self-reported ACP engagement, ease of use, satisfaction, and depression/anxiety. The authors used mixed effects logistic and linear regression adjusted for prior ACP, health literacy, and clinician, including a cancer interaction term.<h4>Results</h4>Of 986 participants, 220 (22%) had cancer. The mean age was 63 years (SD, 6 years), 61% were women, 81% were of a minority race/ethnicity, 45% were Spanish-speaking, 39% had limited health literacy, and 27% had prior ACP. New ACP documentation was higher in the PREPARE arm versus the AD-only arm among participants with cancer (62% vs 43%; P = .01) and without cancer (38% vs 28%; P = .01), as was ACP engagement in both arms (P < .001), with no interactions by cancer. Ease of use and satisfaction were high, and depression/anxiety was low, with no differences by study arm or by cancer/no cancer.<h4>Conclusions</h4>PREPARE plus an easy-to-read AD increased ACP documentation and engagement among diverse older adults with cancer more than an AD alone, with no increase in depression or anxiety between study arms or by cancer. PREPARE may help to decrease ACP disparities among patients with cancer.<h4>Lay summary</h4>Advance care planning (ACP) is the process of sharing values, goals, and preferences for medical care, but engagement in ACP is low among older adults with cancer. Among 986 English- and Spanish-speaking older adults from a safety net hospital, an interactive, multimedia, web-based ACP program (PREPARE for Your Care at https://prepareforyourcare.org/) plus an easy-to-read advance directive increased ACP documentation and engagement more than an advance directive alone.

We conducted a case-control study to investigate the association between patterns of nutrient intake and the risk of GC in Iran. We enrolled 178 GC patients and 271 controls matched for age and sex. We collected dietary intakes using a validated diet history questionnaire. We performed factor analysis on 28 nutrients using multivariate logistic regression models on tertiles of factor scores and estimated odds ratios (OR) and 95% confidence intervals (95% CI). We identified three nutrient patterns. The first pattern included pantothenic acid, riboflavin, zinc, animal protein, and calcium. Selenium, thiamin, carbohydrate, vegetable protein, niacin and low intake of vitamin E loaded the second pattern, and the third pattern was abundant in fiber, carotene, vitamin C and A. We found no significant association between GC and any of the dietary patterns. However, in the first patterns, men in the highest tertile had significantly higher odds of GC than the lowest (OR = 2.15, 95% CI: 1.13-4.09, p trend = 0.02). A dietary pattern loaded by animal products may increase the risk of GC among Iranian men. Larger studies are required to approve these findings in overall and in different subgroups.Supplemental data for this article is available online at https://doi.org/10.1080/01635581.2021.1931697.",hji,,0,0,1,0.0,,
34092780,"Transcultural Adaptation of Tibetan Nursing Trainees: A Case Study of ""9+3"" Vocational Technical Students in Sichuan Province, China.","BACKGROUND Nursing education is an important part of the ""9+3"" vocational education program led by Sichuan Province. In the internship stage, nursing students of Tibetan ethnicity may have problems of intercultural adaptation in the process of getting along with patients, which may affect the effective nursing outcome. The purpose of this study was to clarify the current situation of transcultural adaptation of Tibetan trainee nurses and to provide more theoretical support and guidance. MATERIAL AND METHODS We collected 237 valid survey questionnaires, based on Ward's acculturation process model, from a total of 363 Tibetan trainee nurses in the ""9+3"" free vocational education program in Chengdu, Luzhou, and Nanchong of Sichuan Province. The SPSSAU project (2020), an online application software retrieved from https://www.spssau.com, was used for data coding and archiving. RESULTS The results of questionnaire and data analysis showed that the overall level of transcultural adaptation of Tibetan trainee nurses was that the number of people with poor adaptation was slightly higher than those with good adaptation, and most Tibetan trainee nurses were in the middle level. Meanwhile, sociocultural adaptation was better than psychological adaptation. There were no statistically significant differences among the 4 grouping variables: gender, student home region, the city where the internship hospital was located, and whether they were from a single-child family or not. CONCLUSIONS The results revealed that there was still transcultural maladjustment among Tibetan nurses in the internship stage, and the psychological maladjustment was more obvious than the sociocultural maladjustment. We provide countermeasures and suggestions to solve the problems of transcultural adaptation reflected in the research.",hji,,0,0,1,0.0,,
34096110,'What matters to you?'-a qualitative study on the views of nursing home residents with dementia regarding the health care they receive.,"<h4>Aims and objective</h4>This study's aim is to examine what matters to nursing home residents with dementia by exploring their perceptions of nursing home health care through the conceptual lens of person-centred care.<h4>Background</h4>Dementia is a major contributor to nursing home placement. To understand the meaning of living with dementia, the inclusion of persons with dementia in research studies is essential.<h4>Methods</h4>In total, 35 in-depth qualitative interviews were conducted with people who have dementia and live in nursing homes. A thematic analysis was applied to analyse the data. Checklist for qualitative studies: Consolidated Criteria for Reporting Qualitative Research (COREQ) https://www.equator-network.org/reporting-guidelines/coreq/ RESULTS: The analysis revealed one overarching theme with four sub-themes. Different matchings of person-centred care and routines in health care being the overarching theme. The four sub-themes were as follows: (a) understanding of the interplay between disabilities and ageing; (b) participating based on one's own preferences and needs; (c) incongruence between the person with dementia's preferences and needs and health-care support; and (d) working conditions: the relationship between residents and health-care providers. Despite the substantive focus of researchers on person-centred care and the positive impact on the nursing home health care of those who receive it, the results showed that nursing home residents still want more person-centred care.<h4>Conclusions</h4>The results indicate that the incongruence between general routines and individual preferences and needs, as well as the demand to operationalise the person-centred dimensions of health-care behaviour in nursing homes, must be resolved. Health care in nursing homes must focus on enabling residents to participate in daily activities and sustain their personhood and sense of self.<h4>Relevance to clinical practice</h4>Based on the residents' statements, the results contribute to the fields of dementia education, health-care provision and policy-making and may be used to achieve person-centredness and governance.",hji,,0,0,1,0.0,,
34096320,Treated HIV Infection and Progression of Carotid Atherosclerosis in Rural Uganda: A Prospective Observational Cohort Study.,"Background Although ‚âà70% of the world's population of people living with HIV reside in sub-Saharan Africa, there are minimal prospective data on the contributions of HIV infection to atherosclerosis in the region. Methods and Results We conducted a prospective observational cohort study of people living with HIV on antiretroviral therapy >40 years of age in rural Uganda, along with population-based comparators not infected with HIV. We collected data on cardiovascular disease risk factors and carotid ultrasound measurements annually. We fitted linear mixed effects models, adjusted for cardiovascular disease risk factors, to estimate the association between HIV serostatus and progression of carotid intima media thickness (cIMT). We enrolled 155 people living with HIV and 154 individuals not infected with HIV and collected cIMT images at 1045 visits during a median of 4 annual visits per participant (interquartile range 3-4, range 1-5). Age (median 50.9 years) and sex (49% female) were similar by HIV serostatus. At enrollment, there was no difference in mean cIMT by HIV serostatus (0.665 versus 0.680 mm, <i>P</i>=0.15). In multivariable models, increasing age, blood pressure, and non-high-density lipoprotein cholesterol were associated with greater cIMT (<i>P</i><0.05), however change in cIMT per year was also no different by HIV serostatus (0.004 mm/year for HIV negative [95% CI, 0.001-0.007 mm], 0.006 mm/year for people living with HIV [95% CI, 0.003-0.008 mm], HIV√ótime interaction <i>P</i>=0.25). Conclusions In rural Uganda, treated HIV infection was not associated with faster cIMT progression. These results do not support classification of treated HIV infection as a risk factor for subclinical atherosclerosis progression in rural sub-Saharan Africa.

34122523,Development and Validation of a Hypoxia-Related Signature for Predicting Survival Outcomes in Patients With Bladder Cancer.,"<h4>Objectives</h4>This study aimed to develop and validate a hypoxia signature for predicting survival outcomes in patients with bladder cancer.<h4>Methods</h4>We downloaded the RNA sequence and the clinicopathologic data of the patients with bladder cancer from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) (https://portal.gdc.cancer.gov/repository?facetTab=files) and the Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) (https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/) databases. Hypoxia genes were retrieved from the Molecular Signatures Database (https://www.gsea-msigdb.org/gsea/msigdb/index.jsp). Differentially expressed hypoxia-related genes were screened by univariate Cox regression analysis and Lasso regression analysis. Then, the selected genes constituted the hypoxia signature and were included in multivariate Cox regression to generate the risk scores. After that, we evaluate the predictive performance of this signature by multiple receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves. The CIBERSORT tool was applied to investigate the relationship between the hypoxia signature and the immune cell infiltration, and the maftool was used to summarize and analyze the mutational data. Gene-set enrichment analysis (GSEA) was used to investigate the related signaling pathways of differentially expressed genes in both risk groups. Furthermore, we developed a model and presented it with a nomogram to predict survival outcomes in patients with bladder cancer.<h4>Results</h4>Eight genes (AKAP12, ALDOB, CASP6, DTNA, HS3ST1, JUN, KDELR3, and STC1) were included in the hypoxia signature. The patients with higher risk scores showed worse overall survival time than the ones with lower risk scores in the training set (TCGA) and two external validation sets (GSE13507 and GSE32548). Immune infiltration analysis showed that two types of immune cells (M0 and M1 macrophages) had a significant infiltration in the high-risk group. Tumor mutation burden (TMB) analysis showed that the risk scores between the wild types and the mutation types of TP53, MUC16, RB1, and FGFR3 were significantly different. Gene-Set Enrichment Analysis (GSEA) showed that immune or cancer-associated pathways belonged to the high-risk groups and metabolism-related signal pathways were enriched into the low-risk group. Finally, we constructed a predictive model with risk score, age, and stage and validated its performance in GEO datasets.<h4>Conclusion</h4>We successfully constructed and validated a novel hypoxia signature in bladder cancer, which could accurately predict patients' prognosis.",hji,,0,0,1,0.0,,

A special feature of our data service https://join.fz-juelich.de is on-demand processing of several air quality metrics directly from the TOAR database. As a service that is used by more than 350 users of the international air quality research community, our web service must be easily accessible and functionally flexible, while delivering good performance. The current on-demand calculations of air quality metrics outside the database together with the necessary transfer of large volume raw data are identified as the major performance bottleneck.

34126844,Incidence and prevalence of psychogenic nonepileptic seizures (functional seizures): a systematic review and an analytical study.,"<h4>Aim</h4>Psychogenic nonepileptic seizures (PNES) or functional seizures are universal phenomena. However, data on their epidemiology is limited. The aim of the current study was to review the literature on the epidemiology of PNES and to provide analytical estimates of its incidence and prevalence based on the direct data that are available from previous studies on PNES.<h4>Methods</h4>The methods of this work had two parts: (1) MEDLINE, PsycINFO, and Scopus from inception to 19 October 2019 were systematically searched. (2) The analytical study of the incidence and prevalence of PNES was performed, based on the following data from previous studies: incidence of PNES, duration of PNES before making a diagnosis, outcome and mortality of PNES.<h4>Results</h4>The search strategy yielded five articles; three were on the incidence and two on the prevalence. In the analytical part of the study, the incidence of PNES was calculated to be 3.1 (95% Confidence Interval: 1.1-5.1) per 100,000 population per year. The calculated prevalence rate of PNES in 2019 was 108.5 (95% Confidence Interval: 39.2-177.8) per 100,000 population, in the USA.<h4>Conclusion</h4>While, the generalizability of these calculated incidence and prevalence rates to other places in the world is limited, they give us a reasonable hint that PNES is a common condition and the prevalence is much more than that it was thought before.Supplemental data for this article is available online at https://doi.org/10.1080/00207454.2021.1942870.",hji,,0,0,1,0.0,,

34133393,Evaluation of Bowel Function after Surgical Treatment for Intestinal Endometriosis: A Prospective Study.,"<h4>Background</h4>Defecation symptoms related to intestinal deep infiltrative endometriosis are considered to be caused by anatomical and functional disorders, and are likely linked to the course of the disease and surgical treatment.<h4>Objective</h4>The primary aim of this study was to assess bowel function before and after intestinal deep infiltrative endometriosis surgery. Secondarily, we sought to correlate defecatory symptoms with preoperative risk factors.<h4>Design/settings</h4>This is a single center prospective cohort study, using the Low Anterior Resection Syndrome Score to evaluate bowel function 4 weeks before, as well as at 6 months and one year after surgery. Wilcoxon signed rank test and logistic multiple regression analyses were performed to compare preoperative and postoperative scores. For all of the comparisons, the level of significance was set at <0.05.<h4>Patients</h4>Thirty-seven adult female patients who underwent intestinal resection for deep infiltrative endometriosis between 2015 and 2017 were included.<h4>Main outcome measures</h4>The primary outcome was bowel function appraisement in deep infiltrative endometriosis intestinal surgery.<h4>Results</h4>During the preoperative evaluation, 48.6% of patients reported Low Anterior Resection Syndrome Score ‚â•21. This group presented a mean score of 17.9 ¬± 13.7, with a median of 20 and a range of 5 - 30. After one year, the mean score was decreased to 9.6 ¬± 11.1, with a median of 4 and a range of 0 - 22. A significant difference was detected when comparing the post- and preoperative scores (p=0.0006). It was also reported improvements in defecatory symptoms such as reduced fecal incontinence for flatus (p= 0.004) and liquid stools (p=0.014). The clustering of stools (p=0.005) and fecal urgency (p=0.001) also improved one year after surgery. The preoperative multiple logistic regression showed that dyschezia was the only independent variable associated with bowel symptoms.<h4>Limitations</h4>Despite it is a well-documented prospective study the data presented has a relatively small population.<h4>Conclusions</h4>This study provides evidence that intestinal deep infiltrative endometriosis surgery improves bowel function and has a positive impact on evacuation symptoms.

34142845,"First report of Xanthomonas campestris pv. campestris as the causal agent of necrotic leaf spot in Phaseolus vulgaris at Puebla, Mexico.","Beans are the most cultivated legume in the world. In Mexico, it is the second most important crop after corn (FAO 2020; SIAP 2020). Bean plants ""Flor de Mayo M38"" variety were affected by a foliar disease during the agricultural cycle 2019 in Puebla-Mexico (19¬∞02'46.6"" LN and 98¬∞05'15.6"" LO). Necrotic V- shaped lesions were observed on the margins of the leaves surrounded by yellow halos followed by foliar necrosis, affecting 40% of the crop. In Mexico this variety of cultivars is in great demand for local consumption and generates income in foreign currency (Castellanos et al. 1997). Sampling was carried out on 50 plants ""Flor de Mayo M38"" variety, with necrotic leaf symptoms from ten plots of one hectare. Samples were cut into pieces (5 mm), disinfested with 1% hypochlorite 3 min, and washed with sterile distilled water. Subsequently, samples were dried on sterile paper and placed on Petri plates containing yeast extract calcium carbonate dextrose agar (YDC) medium and kept at 36¬∞C for 3 days. Colonies of ten typical bacteria isolated from all symptomatic plants were Gram (-), small and uniform in size with rounded edges, yellow, convex with entire borders and mucoid appearance on YDC. Bacteria did not grow on 0.1% triphenyl tetrazolium chloride amended casamino acid, peptone, and glucose medium (CPG). Biochemical tests showed that isolates did not reduce nitrate to nitrites, had positive catalase and starch hydrolysis, while the Kovac oxidase test was negative (Schaad and White 1974). Genus identity of the representative isolate Xcf1-APJR, was confirmed by 16S rRNA encoding gene partial sequencing, using universal primers 518F (5'-CCAGCAGCCGCGGTAATACG-3') and 800R (5'-TACCAGGGTATCTAATCC-3') (Halim et al. 2020). BLASTn alignments against the nucleotide collection were 100% identical to Xanthomonas sequences including Xanthomonas campestris pv. campestris strains NZ_AP019684.1, CP025750.1, and MN108237.1. The 1,418 bp sequence was deposited in the GenBank database under accession number MT645246. The identification of species/pathovar was accomplished by serological methods using a polyclonal antiserum specific for X. campestris pv. campestris (Popovic ÃÅ et al. 2013) with the DAS-ELISA commercial kit (catalog number 07122C/096, LOEWE Biochemica GmbH, Germany). The pathogenicity test was carried out on 50 healthy bean plants from the ""Flor de Mayo M38"" variety. Bacterial culture incubated at 28¬∞C for 48 h in YDC medium was used to prepare the bacterial suspension (108 CFU mL-1). The first two lower leaves of 30-day-old plants were inoculated by sprinkling. Ten plants sprayed with sterile distilled water were used as negative control. All plants were kept for 20 days in greenhouse at 18-26¬∞C and relative humidity of 60%. After seven days, chlorotic lesions developed on all inoculated plants that became necrotic from 14 days after inoculation (dai). Necrotic leaf spots merged at 14 dai to form necrotic areas of more than 20 mm in diameter, reaching total necrosis of the leaf tissue at 20 dai and were similar to the symptoms observed in the field. Koch's postulates were confirmed by the reisolation of Xcf1-APJR strain, which presented the same colony morphology, partial sequence, and polyclonal specific detection. This is the first report of this pathogen causing necrotic leaf spot in beans from the ""Flor de Mayo M38"" variety in Puebla-Mexico. The author(s) declare no conflict of interest.

34147079,ORFik: a comprehensive R toolkit for the analysis of translation.,"<h4>Background</h4>With the rapid growth in the use of high-throughput methods for characterizing translation and the continued expansion of multi-omics, there is a need for back-end functions and streamlined tools for processing, analyzing, and characterizing data produced by these assays.<h4>Results</h4>Here, we introduce ORFik, a user-friendly R/Bioconductor API and toolbox for studying translation and its regulation. It extends GenomicRanges from the genome to the transcriptome and implements a framework that integrates data from several sources. ORFik streamlines the steps to process, analyze, and visualize the different steps of translation with a particular focus on initiation and elongation. It accepts high-throughput sequencing data from ribosome profiling to quantify ribosome elongation or RCP-seq/TCP-seq to also quantify ribosome scanning. In addition, ORFik can use CAGE data to accurately determine 5'UTRs and RNA-seq for determining translation relative to RNA abundance. ORFik supports and calculates over 30 different translation-related features and metrics from the literature and can annotate translated regions such as proteins or upstream open reading frames (uORFs). As a use-case, we demonstrate using ORFik to rapidly annotate the dynamics of 5' UTRs across different tissues, detect their uORFs, and characterize their scanning and translation in the downstream protein-coding regions.<h4>Conclusion</h4>In summary, ORFik introduces hundreds of tested, documented and optimized methods. ORFik is designed to be easily customizable, enabling users to create complete workflows from raw data to publication-ready figures for several types of sequencing data. Finally, by improving speed and scope of many core Bioconductor functions, ORFik offers enhancement benefiting the entire Bioconductor environment.<h4>Availability</h4>http://bioconductor.org/packages/ORFik .",hji,,0,0,1,0.0,,

The patients were randomly divided into a training set and a testing set. The X-tile analysis provides the best age and tumor size cut-off point, and changes continuous variables into categorical variables. The independent prognostic factors were determined by Cox regression analysis, and 2 nomograms were established. Receiver operating characteristic curves and calibration curves were used to evaluate the nomograms. Based on the nomograms, 2 web-based nomograms were established.<h4>Results</h4>Two hundred and twenty-eight cases were included in the OS nomogram construction, and were randomly divided into a training set (n=160) and a validation set (n=68). Age, T stage, bone metastasis, surgery, chemotherapy, marital status, tumor size, and tumor site were found to be correlated with OS. One hundred and eighty-three cases were enrolled in the CSS nomogram construction, and randomly divided into a training set (n=129) and a validation set (n=54). Age, bone metastasis, surgery, chemotherapy, tumor size, and tumor site were found to be correlated with CSS. Two nomograms were established to predict OS and CSS. In the training set, the areas under the curve of the nomogram for predicting 1-, 2-, and 3-year OS were 0.783, 0.830, and 0.832, respectively, and those for predicting 1-, 2-, and 3-year CSS were 0.889, 0.777, and 0.884, respectively.

This format reduces the size of a BAM file by 40- to 140-fold while retaining complete read-level CpG methylation information. It is also compatible with the Tabix tool for fast and random access. We implemented a command-line tool, mHapTools, for converting BAM/SAM files from existing platforms to mHap files as well as post-processing DNA methylation data in mHap format.

This study aimed to measure the prevalence and long-term trends associated with primary H. pylori antibiotic resistance, evaluate correlations with antibiotic consumption, and compare predictors for H. pylori antibiotic resistance between HIV-positive and HIV-negative individuals. In this longitudinal registry study, we evaluated consecutive adults with and without HIV infection, na√Øve to H. pylori treatment, who underwent upper gastrointestinal endoscopy and had a positive H. pylori culture, with susceptibility testing available, between 2004 and 2015. Outpatient antibiotic consumption data were based on nationwide aggregated numbers. H. pylori was isolated from gastric biopsies of 3008/8321 patients, 181/477 (37.9%) were HIV-positive and 2827/7844 (36.0%) HIV-negative. Overall cohort mean prevalence of H. pylori primary antibiotic resistance was 11.1% for clarithromycin, 17.8% levofloxacin, and 39.4% metronidazole. The prevalence of H. pylori primary resistance was significantly higher for these three drugs in HIV-positive individuals across the study period. Linear regression showed that the prevalence of clarithromycin and levofloxacin resistance correlated with the country aggregate daily dose consumption of macrolides and quinolones, respectively. Multivariable regression analysis showed that HIV infection is a strong independent risk factor for multiple H. pylori antibiotic resistance. In summary, HIV infection is a risk factor for carrying multi-resistant H. pylori strains and this is correlated with antibiotic consumption. Empirical therapies should be avoided in HIV-positive individuals. These data highlight the need to implement ongoing monitoring of H. pylori antimicrobial susceptibility among HIV-positive individuals.

Respective First Nations were involved in the planning and implementation of data collection for the five principal components: household interviews, tap water sampling for metals, surface water sampling for pharmaceuticals, hair sampling for mercury, and traditional food sampling for contaminants.<h4>Results</h4>A total of 6487 adults from 92 First Nations participated in the Study (participation rate 78%). A higher percentage of females (66%) participated than males (34%). The average age of males and females was similar (44 and 45 years, respectively). This study offers a novel body of coherent and regionally representative evidence on the human dimension of the ongoing environmental degradation affecting First Nations.<h4>Conclusion</h4>FNFNES serves as a good example of participatory research. We encourage public health professionals to develop policy and programs building on the participatory dimension of the research as well as on its results. The information collected by the FNFNES is also important for community empowerment, environmental stewardship and the general promotion of good health by and for First Nations peoples in Canada.",hji,,0,0,1,0.0,,
34188160,NOD: a web server to predict New use of Old Drugs to facilitate drug repurposing.,"Computational methods accelerate the drug repurposing pipelines that are a quicker and cost-effective alternative to discovering new molecules. However, there is a paucity of web servers to conduct fast, focussed, and customized investigations for identifying new uses of old drugs. We present the NOD web server, which has the mentioned characteristics. NOD uses a sensitive sequence-guided approach to identify close and distant homologs of a protein of interest. NOD then exploits this evolutionary information to suggest potential compounds from the DrugBank database that can be repurposed against the input protein. NOD also allows expansion of the chemical space of the potential candidates through similarity searches. We have validated the performance of NOD against available experimental and/or clinical reports. In 65.6% of the investigated cases in a control study, NOD is able to identify drugs more effectively than the searches made in DrugBank.

34191783,A Web-Based Deep Learning Model for Automated Diagnosis of Otoscopic Images.,"<h4>Objectives</h4>To develop a multiclass-classifier deep learning model and website for distinguishing tympanic membrane (TM) pathologies based on otoscopic images.<h4>Methods</h4>An otoscopic image database developed by utilizing publicly available online images and open databases was assessed by convolutional neural network (CNN) models including ResNet-50, Inception-V3, Inception-Resnet-V2, and MobileNetV2. Training and testing were conducted with a 75:25 breakdown. Area under the curve of receiver operating characteristics (AUC-ROC), accuracy, sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value (PPV), and negative predictive value (NPV) were used to compare different CNN models' performances in classifying TM images.<h4>Results</h4>Our database included 400 images, organized into normal (n‚Ää=‚Ää196) and abnormal classes (n‚Ää=‚Ää204), including acute otitis media (n‚Ää=‚Ää116), otitis externa (n‚Ää=‚Ää44), chronic suppurative otitis media (n‚Ää=‚Ää23), and cerumen impaction (n‚Ää=‚Ää21). For binary classification between normal versus abnormal TM, the best performing model had average AUC-ROC of 0.902 (MobileNetV2), followed by 0.745 (Inception-Resnet-V2), 0.731 (ResNet-50), and 0.636 (Inception-V3). Accuracy ranged between 0.73-0.77, sensitivity 0.72-0.88, specificity 0.58-0.84, PPV 0.68-0.81, and NPV 0.73-0.83. Macro-AUC-ROC for MobileNetV2 based multiclass-classifier was 0.91, with accuracy of 66%. Binary and multiclass-classifier models based on MobileNetV2 were loaded onto a publicly accessible and user-friendly website (https://headneckml.com/tympanic). This allows the readership to upload TM images for real-time predictions using the developed algorithms.<h4>Conclusions</h4>Novel CNN algorithms were developed with high AUC-ROCs for differentiating between various TM pathologies.

Median follow-up was 31 months. Superior rectal artery ligation was associated with a similar anastomotic leak rate compared to inferior mesenteric artery ligation (9vs8%, p=1.0). Median number of lymph nodes removed was identical (15vs15, p=0.38). On multivariable analysis accounting for relevant clinicopathologic factors, superior rectal artery ligation was not associated with increased anastomotic leak rate, worse lymph node harvest, or worse locoregional recurrence-free survival, recurrence-free survival, or overall survival (all p>0.1).<h4>Limitations</h4>This was a retrospective design.<h4>Conclusions</h4>Compared to inferior mesenteric artery ligation, superior rectal artery ligation is not associated with either worse technical or oncologic outcomes. Given the potential risks of inadequate blood flow to the proximal limb of the anastomosis and autonomic nerve injury, we advocate for increased utilization of superior rectal artery ligation.

34196957,elaborator: A Novel App for Insights into Laboratory Data of Clinical Trials.,"In clinical studies there are huge numbers of laboratory parameters available that are measured at several visits for several treatment groups. The status quo for presenting laboratory data in clinical trials consists in generating large numbers of tables and data listings. Such tables and listings are required for submissions to health authorities. However, reviewing laboratory data presented in the form of tables and listings is a lengthy and tedious process. Thus, to enable efficient exploration of laboratory data we developed elaborator, a comprehensive and easy-to-use interactive browser-based application. The elaborator app comprises three analyses types for addressing different questions, for example about changes in laboratory values that frequently occur, treatment-related changes and changes beyond the normal ranges. In this way, the app can be used by study teams for identifying safety signals in a clinical trial as well as for generating hypotheses that are further inspected with detailed analyses and possibly data from other sources. The elaborator app is implemented in the statistical software R. The R package elaborator can be obtained from https://cran.r-project.org/package=elaborator . Patients' laboratory data need to be extracted from the clinical database and pre-processed locally for feeding into the app. For exploring data by means of the elaborator, the user needs some familiarity with R but no programming knowledge is required.",hji,,0,0,1,0.0,,

Health literacy plays a crucial role in promoting healthy behaviour and thereby maintaining good health. This study explores the role of health literacy in the GeMuKi (acronym for 'Gemeinsam Gesund: Vorsorge plus f√ºr Mutter und Kind'-Strengthening health promotion: enhanced check-up visits for mother and child) Project. It will assess the ability of the GeMuKi lifestyle intervention to positively affect health literacy levels through active participation in preventive counselling. The study also explores associations between health literacy, health outcomes, health service use and effectiveness of the intervention.<h4>Methods and analysis</h4>The GeMuKi trial has a hybrid effectiveness-implementation design and is carried out in routine prenatal health service settings in Germany. Women (n=1860) are recruited by their gynaecologist during routine check-up visits before 12 weeks of gestation. Trained healthcare providers carry out counselling using motivational interviewing techniques to positively affect health literacy and lifestyle-related risk factors. Healthcare providers (gynaecologists and midwives) and women jointly agree on Specific, Measurable, Achievable Reasonable, Time-Bound goals. Women will be invited to fill in questionnaires at two time points (at recruitment and 37th-40th week of gestation) using an app. Health literacy is measured using the German version of the Health Literacy Survey-16 and the Brief Health Literacy Screener. Lifestyle is measured with questions on physical activity, nutrition, alcohol and drug use. Health outcomes of both mother and child, including gestational weight gain (GWG) will be documented at each routine visit. Health service use will be assessed using social health insurance claims data. Data analyses will be conducted using IBM SPSS Statistics, version 26.0. These include descriptive statistics, tests and regression models. A mediation model will be conducted to answer the question whether health behaviour mediates the association between health literacy and GWG.<h4>Ethics and dissemination</h4>The study was approved by the University Hospital of Cologne Research Ethics Committee (ID: 18-163) and the State Chamber of Physicians in Baden-Wuerttemberg (ID: B-F-2018-100). Study results will be disseminated through (poster) presentations at conferences, publications in peer-reviewed journals and press releases.<h4>Trail registration</h4>German Clinical Trials Register (DRKS00013173).

34213323,pdCSM-cancer: Using Graph-Based Signatures to Identify Small Molecules with Anticancer Properties.,"The development of new, effective, and safe drugs to treat cancer remains a challenging and time-consuming task due to limited hit rates, restraining subsequent development efforts. Despite the impressive progress of quantitative structure-activity relationship and machine learning-based models that have been developed to predict molecule pharmacodynamics and bioactivity, they have had mixed success at identifying compounds with anticancer properties against multiple cell lines. Here, we have developed a novel predictive tool, pdCSM-cancer, which uses a graph-based signature representation of the chemical structure of a small molecule in order to accurately predict molecules likely to be active against one or multiple cancer cell lines. pdCSM-cancer represents the most comprehensive anticancer bioactivity prediction platform developed till date, comprising trained and validated models on experimental data of the growth inhibition concentration (GI50%) effects, including over 18,000 compounds, on 9 tumor types and 74 distinct cancer cell lines. Across 10-fold cross-validation, it achieved Pearson's correlation coefficients of up to 0.74 and comparable performance of up to 0.67 across independent, non-redundant blind tests. Leveraging the insights from these cell line-specific models, we developed a generic predictive model to identify molecules active in at least 60 cell lines. Our final model achieved an area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) of up to 0.94 on 10-fold cross-validation and up to 0.94 on independent non-redundant blind tests, outperforming alternative approaches. We believe that our predictive tool will provide a valuable resource to optimizing and enriching screening libraries for the identification of effective and safe anticancer molecules. To provide a simple and integrated platform to rapidly screen for potential biologically active molecules with favorable anticancer properties, we made pdCSM-cancer freely available online at http://biosig.unimelb.edu.au/pdcsm_cancer.",hji,,0,0,1,0.0,,data to train and test and the models

Factors included in the model were determined by univariate and multiple Cox proportional hazard analyses based on the training set.<h4>Results</h4>Independent prognostic factors including etiology, hemoglobin level, creatinine level, proteinuria, and urinary protein/creatinine ratio were determined and contained in the model. The model showed good calibration and discrimination. The area under the curve (AUC) values generated to predict 1-, 2-, and 3-year progression-free survival in the training set were 0.947, 0.931, and 0.939, respectively. In the validation set, the model still revealed excellent calibration and discrimination, and the AUC values generated to predict 1-, 2-, and 3-year progression-free survival were 0.948, 0.933, and 0.915, respectively. In addition, decision curve analysis demonstrated that the model was clinically beneficial. Moreover, to visualize the prediction results, we established a web-based calculator ( https://ncutool.shinyapps.io/CKDprogression/ ).<h4>Conclusion</h4>An easy-to-operate model based on five relevant factors was developed and validated as a conventional tool to assist doctors with clinical decision-making and personalized treatment.",hji,,0,0,1,0.0,,
34224351,Deep Learning for Ultrasound Image Formation: CUBDL Evaluation Framework &amp; Open Datasets.,"Deep learning for ultrasound image formation is rapidly garnering research support and attention, quickly rising as the latest frontier in ultrasound image formation, with much promise to balance both image quality and display speed. Despite this promise, one challenge with identifying optimal solutions is the absence of unified evaluation methods and datasets that are not specific to a single research group. This paper introduces the largest known international database of ultrasound channel data and describes associated evaluation methods that were initially developed for the Challenge on Ultrasound Beamforming with Deep Learning (CUBDL), which was offered as a component of the 2020 IEEE International Ultrasonics Symposium. We summarize the challenge results and present qualitative and quantitative assessments using both the initially closed CUBDL evaluation test dataset (which was crowd-sourced from multiple groups around the world) and additional in vivo breast ultrasound data contributed after the challenge was completed. As an example quantitative assessment, single plane wave images from the CUBDL Task 1 dataset produced a mean generalized contrast-to-noise ratio (gCNR) of 0.67 and a mean lateral resolution of 0.42 mm when formed with delay-and-sum beamforming, compared to a mean gCNR as high as 0.81 and a mean lateral resolution as low as 0.32 mm when formed with networks submitted by the challenge winners. We also describe contributed CUBDL data that may be used for training of future networks. The compiled database includes a total of 576 image acquisition sequences. We additionally introduce a neural network-based global sound speed estimator implementation that was necessary to fairly evaluate results obtained with this international database. The integration of CUBDL evaluation methods, evaluation code, network weights from the challenge winners, and all datasets described herein are publicly available (visit https://cubdl.jhu.edu for details).",hji,,0,0,1,0.0,,training and test data

29724163,EuGI: a novel resource for studying genomic islands to facilitate horizontal gene transfer detection in eukaryotes.,"BACKGROUND:Genomic islands (GIs) are inserts of foreign DNA that have potentially arisen through horizontal gene transfer (HGT). There are evidences that GIs can contribute significantly to the evolution of prokaryotes. The acquisition of GIs through HGT in eukaryotes has, however, been largely unexplored. In this study, the previously developed GI prediction tool, SeqWord Gene Island Sniffer (SWGIS), is modified to predict GIs in eukaryotic chromosomes. Artificial simulations are used to estimate ratios of predicting false positive and false negative GIs by inserting GIs into different test chromosomes and performing the SWGIS v2.0 algorithm. Using SWGIS v2.0, GIs are then identified in 36 fungal, 22 protozoan and 8 invertebrate genomes. RESULTS:SWGIS v2.0 predicts GIs in large eukaryotic chromosomes based on the atypical nucleotide composition of these regions. Averages for predicting false negative and false positive GIs were 20.1% and 11.01% respectively. A total of 10,550 GIs were identified in 66 eukaryotic species with 5299 of these GIs coding for at least one functional protein. The EuGI web-resource, freely accessible at http://eugi.bi.up.ac.za , was developed that allows browsing the database created from identified GIs and genes within GIs through an interactive and visual interface. CONCLUSIONS:SWGIS v2.0 along with the EuGI database, which houses GIs identified in 66 different eukaryotic species, and the EuGI web-resource, provide the first comprehensive resource for studying HGT in eukaryotes.",hji,,1,1,1,1.0,,
29997612,CDG: An Online Server for Detecting Biologically Closest Disease-Causing Genes and its Application to Primary Immunodeficiency.,"High-throughput genomic technologies yield about 20,000 variants in the protein-coding exome of each individual. A commonly used approach to select candidate disease-causing variants is to test whether the associated gene has been previously reported to be disease-causing. In the absence of known disease-causing genes, it can be challenging to associate candidate genes with specific genetic diseases. To facilitate the discovery of novel gene-disease associations, we determined the putative biologically closest known genes and their associated diseases for 13,005 human genes not currently reported to be disease-associated. We used these data to construct the closest disease-causing genes (CDG) server, which can be used to infer the closest genes with an associated disease for a user-defined list of genes or diseases. We demonstrate the utility of the CDG server in five immunodeficiency patient exomes across different diseases and modes of inheritance, where CDG dramatically reduced the number of candidate genes to be evaluated. This resource will be a considerable asset for ascertaining the potential relevance of genetic variants found in patient exomes to specific diseases of interest.

Multiple databases have been dedicated to PTMs, including recent initiatives oriented towards the in silico prediction of PTM interactions. The study of PTM cross-talk ultimately requires experimental evidence about whether certain PTMs coexist in a single protein molecule. However, available resources do not assist researchers in the experimental detection of co-modified peptides.<h4>Results</h4>Herein, we present TCellXTalk, a comprehensive database of phosphorylation, ubiquitination and acetylation sites in human T cells that supports the experimental detection of co-modified peptides using targeted or directed mass spectrometry. We demonstrate the efficacy of TCellXTalk and the strategy presented here in a proof of concept experiment that enabled the identification and quantification of 15 co-modified (phosphorylated and ubiquitinated) peptides from CD3 proteins of the T-cell receptor complex. To our knowledge, these are the first co-modified peptide sequences described in this widely studied cell type. Furthermore, quantitative data showed distinct dynamics for co-modified peptides upon T cell activation, demonstrating differential regulation of co-occurring PTMs in this biological context. Overall, TCellXTalk facilitates the experimental detection of co-modified peptides in human T cells and puts forward a novel and generic strategy for the study of PTM cross-talk.<h4>Availability and implementation</h4>TCellXTalk is available at https://www.tcellxtalk.org.

The results were integrated into a combined database and set of interactive analysis tools, designated the NCI Transcriptional Pharmacodynamics Workbench (NCI TPW), that allows exploration of gene-expression modulation by molecular pathway, drug target, and association with drug sensitivity. We identified common transcriptional responses across agents and cell types and uncovered gene-expression changes associated with drug sensitivity. We also demonstrated the value of this tool for investigating clinically relevant molecular hypotheses and identifying candidate biomarkers of drug activity. The NCI TPW, publicly available at https://tpwb.nci.nih.gov, provides a comprehensive resource to facilitate understanding of tumor cell characteristics that define sensitivity to commonly used anticancer drugs.

30715167,The global dissemination of bacterial infections necessitates the study of reverse genomic epidemiology.,"Whole genome sequencing (WGS) has revolutionized the genotyping of bacterial pathogens and is expected to become the new gold standard for tracing the transmissions of bacterial infectious diseases for public health purposes. Traditional genomic epidemiology often uses WGS as a verification tool, namely, when a common source or epidemiological link is suspected, the collected isolates are sequenced for the determination of clonal relationships. However, increasingly frequent international travel and food transportation, and the associated potential for the cross-border transmission of bacterial pathogens, often lead to an absence of information on bacterial transmission routes. Here we introduce the concept of 'reverse genomic epidemiology', i.e. when isolates are inspected by genome comparisons to be sufficiently similar to one another, they are assumed to be a consequence of infection from a common source. Through BacWGSTdb (http://bacdb.org/BacWGSTdb/), a database we have developed for bacterial genome typing and source tracking, we have found that almost the entire analyzed 20 bacterial species exhibit the phenomenon of cross-border clonal dissemination. Five networks were further identified in which isolates sharing nearly identical genomes were collected from at least five different countries. Three of these have been documented as real infectious disease outbreaks, therefore demonstrating the feasibility and authority of reverse genomic epidemiology. Our survey and proposed strategy would be of potential value in establishing a global surveillance system for tracing bacterial transmissions and outbreaks; the related database and techniques require urgent standardization.",hji,,1,1,1,1.0,,

31197322,MetOSite: an integrated resource for the study of methionine residues sulfoxidation.,"<h4>Motivation</h4>The oxidation of protein-bound methionine to form methionine sulfoxide has traditionally been regarded as an oxidative damage. However, growing evidences support the view of this reversible reaction also as a regulatory post-translational modification. Thus, the oxidation of methionine residues has been reported to have multiple and varied implications for protein function. However, despite the importance of this modification and the abundance of reports, all these data are scattered in the literature. No database/resource on methionine sulfoxidation exists currently. Since this information is useful to gain further insights into the redox regulation of cellular proteins, we have created a primary database of experimentally confirmed sulfoxidation sites.<h4>Results</h4>MetOSite currently contains 7242 methionine sulfoxide sites found in 3562 different proteins from 23 species, with Homo sapiens, Arabidopsis thaliana and Bacillus cereus as the main contributors. Each collected site has been classified according to the effect of its sulfoxidation on the biological properties of the modified protein. Thus, MetOSite documents cases where the sulfoxidation of methionine leads to (i) gain of activity, (ii) loss of activity, (iii) increased protein-protein interaction susceptibility, (iv) decreased protein-protein interaction susceptibility, (v) changes in protein stability and (vi) changes in subcellular location.<h4>Availability and implementation</h4>MetOSite is available at https://metosite.uma.es.",hji,,1,1,1,1.0,,
31307376,PhenPath: a tool for characterizing biological functions underlying different phenotypes.,"<h4>Background</h4>Many diseases are associated with complex patterns of symptoms and phenotypic manifestations. Parsimonious explanations aim at reconciling the multiplicity of phenotypic traits with the perturbation of one or few biological functions. For this, it is necessary to characterize human phenotypes at the molecular and functional levels, by exploiting gene annotations and known relations among genes, diseases and phenotypes. This characterization makes it possible to implement tools for retrieving functions shared among phenotypes, co-occurring in the same patient and facilitating the formulation of hypotheses about the molecular causes of the disease.<h4>Results</h4>We introduce PhenPath, a new resource consisting of two parts: PhenPathDB and PhenPathTOOL. The former is a database collecting the human genes associated with the phenotypes described in Human Phenotype Ontology (HPO) and OMIM Clinical Synopses. Phenotypes are then associated with biological functions and pathways by means of NET-GE, a network-based method for functional enrichment of sets of genes. The present version considers only phenotypes related to diseases. PhenPathDB collects information for 18 OMIM Clinical synopses and 7137 HPO phenotypes, related to 4292 diseases and 3446 genes. Enrichment of Gene Ontology annotations endows some 87.7, 86.9 and 73.6% of HPO phenotypes with Biological Process, Molecular Function and Cellular Component terms, respectively.

The biosynthetic machinery responsible for the production of these secondary metabolites (SMs) (also called natural products) is often encoded by collocated groups of genes called biosynthetic gene clusters (BGCs). High-throughput genome sequencing of both isolates and metagenomic samples combined with the development of specialized computational workflows is enabling systematic identification of BGCs and the discovery of novel SMs. In order to advance exploration of microbial secondary metabolism and its diversity, we developed the largest publicly available database of predicted BGCs combined with experimentally verified BGCs, the Integrated Microbial Genomes Atlas of Biosynthetic gene Clusters (IMG-ABC) (https://img.jgi.doe.gov/abc-public). Here we describe the first major content update of the IMG-ABC knowledgebase, since its initial release in 2015, refreshing the BGC prediction pipeline with the latest version of antiSMASH (v5) as well as presenting the data in the context of underlying environmental metadata sourced from GOLD (https://gold.jgi.doe.gov/).

To unravel the complexity of the clinical phenotype-genotype network, we used cardiovascular diseases (CVDs) and associated non-coding RNAs (ncRNAs) (i.e. miRNAs, long ncRNAs, etc.) as the case for the study of CVDs at a systems or network level. We first integrated a database of CVDs and ncRNAs (CVDncR, http://sysbio.org.cn/cvdncr/) to construct CVD-ncRNA networks and annotate their clinical associations. To characterize the networks, we then separated the miRNAs into two groups, i.e. universal miRNAs associated with at least two types of CVDs and specific miRNAs related only to one type of CVD. Our analyses indicated two interesting patterns in these CVD-ncRNA networks. First, scale-free features were present within both CVD-miRNA and CVD-lncRNA networks; second, universal miRNAs were more likely to be CVDs biomarkers. These results were confirmed by computational functional analyses. The findings offer theoretical guidance for decoding CVD-ncRNA associations and will facilitate the screening of CVD ncRNA biomarkers. Database URL: http://sysbio.org.cn/cvdncr/.",hji,,1,1,1,1.0,,

Accumulating evidence reveals that non-coding RNAs (ncRNAs) are closely associated with a wide variety of EDs. However, abundant associations between ncRNAs and EDs are scattered across the published literature, obstructing a global view of ncRNA-ED associations. A public resource of high-quality manually curated ncRNAomics knowledge associated with EDs remains unavailable. To address this gap, we thus developed Nc2Eye (http://nc2eye.bio-data.cn/), which is the first knowledgebase dedicated to providing a comprehensive ncRNAomics resource for bridging basic and clinical research in EDs. Through a comprehensive review of more than 2400 published papers, Nc2Eye catalogs 7088 manually curated ncRNA-ED associations involving 4363 ncRNAs across eight species. We also provide detailed descriptions and annotation information for each ncRNA-disease association such as ncRNA categories, experimental methods, expression pattern and related clinical drugs. To further expand the pathogenic ncRNAs, we also collected more than 90 high-throughput EDs-related transcriptome datasets. Furthermore, a user-friendly interface was constructed for convenient and flexible data browsing, querying, and retrieving. We believe that Nc2Eye is a timely and valuable knowledgebase for significantly improving and useful for discovery of new diagnostic and therapeutic biomarkers.",hji,,1,1,1,1.0,,

Gene and protein regulatory networks are subsequently being derived based on these proteogenomic profiles, which serve as tools to gain systems-level understanding of the molecular regulatory factories underlying these diseases. On the other hand, it remains a challenge to effectively visualize and navigate the resulting network models, which capture higher order structures in the proteogenomic profiles. There is a pressing need to have a new open community resource tool for intuitive visual exploration, interpretation, and communication of these gene/protein regulatory networks by the cancer research community. In this work, ProNetView-ccRCC (http://ccrcc.cptac-network-view.org/), an interactive web-based network exploration portal for investigating phosphopeptide co-expression network inferred based on the CPTAC clear cell renal cell carcinoma (ccRCC) phosphoproteomics data is introduced. ProNetView-ccRCC enables quick, user-intuitive visual interactions with the ccRCC tumor phosphoprotein co-expression network comprised of 3614 genes, as well as 30 functional pathway-enriched network modules.

32392583,"M6A2Target: a comprehensive database for targets of m6A writers, erasers and readers.","N6-methyladenosine (m6A) is the most abundant posttranscriptional modification in mammalian mRNA molecules and has a crucial function in the regulation of many fundamental biological processes. The m6A modification is a dynamic and reversible process regulated by a series of writers, erasers and readers (WERs). Different WERs might have different functions, and even the same WER might function differently in different conditions, which are mostly due to different downstream genes being targeted by the WERs. Therefore, identification of the targets of WERs is particularly important for elucidating this dynamic modification. However, there is still no public repository to host the known targets of WERs. Therefore, we developed the m6A WER target gene database (m6A2Target) to provide a comprehensive resource of the targets of m6A WERs. M6A2Target provides a user-friendly interface to present WER targets in two different modules: 'Validated Targets', referred to as WER targets identified from low-throughput studies, and 'Potential Targets', including WER targets analyzed from high-throughput studies. Compared to other existing m6A-associated databases, m6A2Target is the first specific resource for m6A WER target genes.

The accumulation of metagenomic sequencing studies enables us to better understand the temporal and spatial variations of the gut microbiota under different physiological and pathological conditions. However, it is inconvenient for scientists to query and retrieve published data; thus, a comprehensive resource for the quantitative gut metagenome is urgently needed. In this study, we developed gut MEtaGenome Atlas (gutMEGA), a well-annotated comprehensive database, to curate and host published quantitative gut microbiota datasets from Homo sapiens. By carefully curating the gut microbiota composition, phenotypes and experimental information, gutMEGA finally integrated 59 132 quantification events for 6457 taxa at seven different levels (kingdom, phylum, class, order, family, genus and species) under 776 conditions.

To this end, however, required collective information is not yet available on a single platform. Hence, we have developed the DenvInD database for experimentally validated DENV inhibitors against its known targets presently hosted at https://webs.iiitd.edu.in/raghava/denvind/. This database provides comprehensive information, i.e. PubChem IDs, SMILES, IC50, EC50, CC50, and wherever available Ki values of the 484 compounds in vitro validated as inhibitors against respective drug targets of DENV. Also, the DenvInD database has been linked to the user-friendly web-based interface and accessibility features, such as simple search, advanced search and data browsing. All the required data curation was conducted manually from the reported scientific literature and PubChem. The collected information was then organized into the DenvInD database using sequence query language under user interface by hypertext markup language. DenvInD is the first useful repository of its kind which would augment the DENV drug discovery research by providing essential information on known DENV inhibitors for molecular docking, computational screening, pharmacophore modeling and quantitative structure-activity relationship modeling.",hji,,1,1,1,1.0,,

It is a diploid (2n‚Äâ=‚Äâ14) outbreeding species that belongs to the genus Festuca. Together with Lolium perenne, they are the most important genera of forage grasses. Meadow fescue has very high quality of yield with good winter survival and persistency. However, extensive genomic resources for meadow fescue have not become available so far. To address this lack of comprehensive publicly available datasets, we have developed functionally annotated draft genome sequences of two meadow fescue genotypes, 'HF7/2' and 'B14/16', and constructed the platform ForageGrassBase, available at http://foragegrass.org/, for data visualization, download and querying. This is the first open-access platform that provides extensive genomic resources related to this forage grass species. The current database provides the most up-to-date draft genome sequence along with structural and functional annotations for genes that can be accessed using Genome Browser (GBrowse), along with comparative genomic alignments to Arabidopsis, L. perenne, barley, rice, Brachypodium and maize genomes. We have integrated homologous search tool BLAST also for the users to analyze their data. Combined, GBrowse, BLAST and downloadable data gives a user-friendly access to meadow fescue genomic resources. To our knowledge, ForageGrassBase is the first genome database dedicated to forage grasses.

As 'liquid biopsy' and novel resource for biomarkers, exosomes provide a promising avenue for the diagnosis and treatment of breast cancer. Although several exosome-related databases have been developed, there is still lacking of an integrated database for exosome-based biomarker discovery. To this end, a comprehensive database ExoBCD (https://exobcd.liumwei.org) was constructed with the combination of robust analysis of four high-throughput datasets, transcriptome validation of 1191 TCGA cases and manual mining of 950 studies. In ExoBCD, approximately 20 900 annotation entries were integrated from 25 external sources and 306 exosomal molecules (49 potential biomarkers and 257 biologically interesting molecules). The latter could be divided into 3 molecule types, including 121 mRNAs, 172 miRNAs and 13 lncRNAs. Thus, the well-linked information about molecular characters, experimental biology, gene expression patterns, overall survival, functional evidence, tumour stage and clinical use were fully integrated. As a data-driven and literature-based paradigm proposed of biomarker discovery, this study also demonstrated the corroborative analysis and identified 36 promising molecules, as well as the most promising prognostic biomarkers, IGF1R and FRS2. Taken together, ExoBCD is the first well-corroborated knowledge base for exosomal studies of breast cancer.

32597467,A comprehensive integrated drug similarity resource for in-silico drug repositioning and beyond.,"Drug similarity studies are driven by the hypothesis that similar drugs should display similar therapeutic actions and thus can potentially treat a similar constellation of diseases. Drug-drug similarity has been derived by variety of direct and indirect sources of evidence and frequently shown high predictive power in discovering validated repositioning candidates as well as other in-silico drug development applications. Yet, existing resources either have limited coverage or rely on an individual source of evidence, overlooking the wealth and diversity of drug-related data sources. Hence, there has been an unmet need for a comprehensive resource integrating diverse drug-related information to derive multi-evidenced drug-drug similarities. We addressed this resource gap by compiling heterogenous information for an exhaustive set of small-molecule drugs (total of 10 367 in the current version) and systematically integrated multiple sources of evidence to derive a multi-modal drug-drug similarity network. The resulting database, 'DrugSimDB' currently includes 238 635 drug pairs with significant aggregated similarity, complemented with an interactive user-friendly web interface (http://vafaeelab.com/drugSimDB.html), which not only enables database ease of access, search, filtration and export, but also provides a variety of complementary information on queried drugs and interactions.

In tomato (Solanum lycopersicum), the availability of the genome sequence, followed by the resequencing of tomato cultivars and its wild relatives, has provided a prodigious resource for the improvement of traits. A high-quality genome resequencing of 84 tomato accessions and wild relatives generated a dataset that can be used as a resource to identify agronomically important alleles across the genome. Converting this dataset into a searchable database, including information about the influence of single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) on protein function, provides valuable information about the genetic variations. The database will assist in searching for functional variants of a gene for introgression into tomato cultivars.<h4>Results</h4>A recent release of better-quality tomato genome reference assembly SL3.0, and new annotation ITAG3.2 of SL3.0, dropped 3857 genes, added 4900 novel genes and updated 20 766 genes. Using the above version, we remapped the data from the tomato lines resequenced under the '100 tomato genome resequencing project' on new tomato genome assembly SL3.0 and made an online searchable Tomato Genomic Variations (TGVs) database. The TGV contains information about SNPs and insertion/deletion events and expands it by functional annotation of variants with new ITAG3.2 using SIFT4G software. This database with search function assists in inferring the influence of SNPs on the function of a target gene.

Improvements include ingestion of complex sequence assembly data categories (metagenomic and metatranscriptomic assemblies, single cell amplified genomes, and metagenome assembled genomes), prediction of the least common ancestor (LCA) for a peptide shared across multiple organisms, increased performance through updates to the backend architecture, and development of a web portal (https://metatryp.whoi.edu). Major expansion of the marine METATRYP database with predicted proteomes from environmental sequencing confirms a low occurrence of shared tryptic peptides among disparate marine microorganisms, implying tractability for targeted metaproteomics. METATRYP was designed to facilitate ocean metaproteomics and has been integrated into the Ocean Protein Portal (https://oceanproteinportal.org); however, it can be readily applied to other domains.

Features in the current IDDB version were manually curated as follows: (i) a total of 307 infertility-associated genes in human and 1348 genes associated with reproductive disorder in 9 model organisms; (ii) a total of 202 chromosomal abnormalities leading to human infertility, including aneuploidies and structural variants; and (iii) a total of 2078 pathogenic variants from infertility patients' samples across 60 different diseases causing infertility. Additionally, the characteristics of clinically diagnosed infertility patients (i.e. causative variants, laboratory indexes and clinical manifestations) were collected. To the best of our knowledge, the IDDB is the first infertility database serving as a systematic resource for biologists to decipher infertility mechanisms and for clinicians to achieve better diagnosis/treatment of patients from disease phenotype to genetic factors.

32943659,The landscape of microsatellites in the enset (Ensete ventricosum) genome and web-based marker resource development.,"Ensete ventricosum (Musaceae, enset) is an Ethiopian food security crop. To realize the potential of enset for rural livelihoods, further knowledge of enset diversity, genetics and genomics is required to support breeding programs and conservation. This study was conducted to explore the enset genome to develop molecular markers, genomics resources, and characterize enset landraces while giving insight into the organization of the genome. We identified 233 microsatellites (simple sequence repeats, SSRs) per Mbp in the enset genome, representing 0.28% of the genome. Mono- and di-nucleotide repeats motifs were found in a higher proportion than other classes of SSR-motifs. In total, 154,586 non-redundant enset microsatellite markers (EMM) were identified and 40 selected for primer development. Marker validation by PCR and low-cost agarose gel electrophoresis revealed that 92.5% were polymorphic, showing a high PIC (Polymorphism Information Content; 0.87) and expected heterozygosity (He‚Äâ=‚Äâ0.79-0.82). In silico analysis of genomes of closely related species showed 46.86% of the markers were transferable among enset species and 1.90% were transferable to Musa. The SSRs are robust (with basic PCR methods and agarose gel electrophoresis), informative, and applicable in measuring enset diversity, genotyping, selection and potentially breeding. Enset SSRs are available in a web-based database at https://enset-project.org/EnMom@base.html (or https://enset.aau.edu.et/index.html , downloadable from Figshare).",hji,,1,1,1,1.0,,

There are 3 major interaction types in an interactome: microbiome-DME interaction (MICBIO), xenobiotics-DME interaction (XEOTIC) and host protein-DME interaction (HOSPPI). The interaction data of each type are essential for drug metabolism, and the collective consideration of multiple types has implication for the future practice of precision medicine. However, no database was designed to systematically provide the data of all types of DME interactions. Here, a database of the Interactome of Drug-Metabolizing Enzymes (INTEDE) was therefore constructed to offer these interaction data.

This species is useful in numerous fields, including developmental biology, neurobiology, and ageing. A high-quality comprehensive molecular interaction network is needed to facilitate molecular mechanism studies in C. elegans.<h4>Results</h4>We present the predicted functional interactome of Caenorhabditis elegans (FIC), which integrates functional association data from 10 public databases to infer functional gene interactions on diverse functional perspectives. In this work, FIC includes 108,550 putative functional associations with balanced sensitivity and specificity, which are expected to cover 21.42% of all C. elegans protein interactions, and 29.25% of these associations may represent protein interactions. Based on FIC, we developed a gene set linkage analysis (GSLA) web tool to interpret potential functional impacts from a set of differentially expressed genes observed in transcriptome analyses.<h4>Conclusion</h4>We present the predicted C. elegans interactome database FIC, which is a high-quality database of predicted functional interactions among genes. The functional interactions in FIC serve as a good reference interactome for GSLA to annotate differentially expressed genes for their potential functional impacts.

33119751,The MemMoRF database for recognizing disordered protein regions interacting with cellular membranes.,"Protein and lipid membrane interactions play fundamental roles in a large number of cellular processes (e.g. signalling, vesicle trafficking, or viral invasion). A growing number of examples indicate that such interactions can also rely on intrinsically disordered protein regions (IDRs), which can form specific reversible interactions not only with proteins but also with lipids. We named IDRs involved in such membrane lipid-induced disorder-to-order transition as MemMoRFs, in an analogy to IDRs exhibiting disorder-to-order transition upon interaction with protein partners termed Molecular Recognition Features (MoRFs). Currently, both the experimental detection and computational characterization of MemMoRFs are challenging, and information about these regions are scattered in the literature. To facilitate the related investigations we generated a comprehensive database of experimentally validated MemMoRFs based on manual curation of literature and structural data. To characterize the dynamics of MemMoRFs, secondary structure propensity and flexibility calculated from nuclear magnetic resonance chemical shifts were incorporated into the database. These data were supplemented by inclusion of sentences from papers, functional data and disease-related information. The MemMoRF database can be accessed via a user-friendly interface at https://memmorf.hegelab.org, potentially providing a central resource for the characterization of disordered regions in transmembrane and membrane-associated proteins.",hji,,1,1,1,1.0,,

33166388,LegumeIP V3: from models to crops-an integrative gene discovery platform for translational genomics in legumes.,"Legumes have contributed to human health, sustainable food and feed production worldwide for centuries. The study of model legumes has played vital roles in deciphering key genes, pathways, and networks regulating biological mechanisms and agronomic traits. Along with emerging breeding technology such as genome editing, translation of the knowledge gained from model plants to crops is in high demand. The updated database (V3) was redesigned for translational genomics targeting the discovery of novel key genes in less-studied non-model legume crops by referring to the knowledge gained in model legumes. The database contains genomic data for all 22 included species, and transcriptomic data covering thousands of RNA-seq samples mostly from model species. The rich biological data and analytic tools for gene expression and pathway analyses can be used to decipher critical genes, pathways, and networks in model legumes. The integrated comparative genomic functions further facilitate the translation of this knowledge to legume crops. Therefore, the database will be a valuable resource to identify important genes regulating specific biological mechanisms or agronomic traits in the non-model yet economically significant legume crops.

33175872,High density genotype storage for plant breeding in the Chado schema of Breedbase.,"Modern breeding programs routinely use genome-wide information for selecting individuals to advance. The large volumes of genotypic information required present a challenge for data storage and query efficiency. Major use cases require genotyping data to be linked with trait phenotyping data. In contrast to phenotyping data that are often stored in relational database schemas, next-generation genotyping data are traditionally stored in non-relational storage systems due to their extremely large scope. This study presents a novel data model implemented in Breedbase (https://breedbase.org/) for uniting relational phenotyping data and non-relational genotyping data within the open-source PostgreSQL database engine. Breedbase is an open-source, web-database designed to manage all of a breeder's informatics needs: management of field experiments, phenotypic and genotypic data collection and storage, and statistical analyses. The genotyping data is stored in a PostgreSQL data-type known as binary JavaScript Object Notation (JSONb), where the JSON structures closely follow the Variant Call Format (VCF) data model. The Breedbase genotyping data model can handle different ploidy levels, structural variants, and any genotype encoded in VCF. JSONb is both compressed and indexed, resulting in a space and time efficient system. Furthermore, file caching maximizes data retrieval performance. Integration of all breeding data within the Chado database schema retains referential integrity that may be lost when genotyping and phenotyping data are stored in separate systems. Benchmarking demonstrates that the system is fast enough for computation of a genomic relationship matrix (GRM) and genome wide association study (GWAS) for datasets involving 1,325 diploid Zea mays, 314 triploid Musa acuminata, and 924 diploid Manihot esculenta samples genotyped with 955,690, 142,119, and 287,952 genotype-by-sequencing (GBS) markers, respectively.",hji,,1,1,1,1.0,,

We have adopted new methods of assessing proteome completeness and quality. We continue to extract detailed annotations from the literature to add to reviewed entries and supplement these in unreviewed entries with annotations provided by automated systems such as the newly implemented Association-Rule-Based Annotator (ARBA). We have developed a credit-based publication submission interface to allow the community to contribute publications and annotations to UniProt entries. We describe how UniProtKB responded to the COVID-19 pandemic through expert curation of relevant entries that were rapidly made available to the research community through a dedicated portal.

33237311,"The STRING database in 2021: customizable protein-protein networks, and functional characterization of user-uploaded gene/measurement sets.","Cellular life depends on a complex web of functional associations between biomolecules. Among these associations, protein-protein interactions are particularly important due to their versatility, specificity and adaptability. The STRING database aims to integrate all known and predicted associations between proteins, including both physical interactions as well as functional associations. To achieve this, STRING collects and scores evidence from a number of sources: (i) automated text mining of the scientific literature, (ii) databases of interaction experiments and annotated complexes/pathways, (iii) computational interaction predictions from co-expression and from conserved genomic context and (iv) systematic transfers of interaction evidence from one organism to another. STRING aims for wide coverage; the upcoming version 11.5 of the resource will contain more than 14 000 organisms. In this update paper, we describe changes to the text-mining system, a new scoring-mode for physical interactions, as well as extensive user interface features for customizing, extending and sharing protein networks. In addition, we describe how to query STRING with genome-wide, experimental data, including the automated detection of enriched functionalities and potential biases in the user's query data.

33237313,RepeatsDB in 2021: improved data and extended classification for protein tandem repeat structures.,"The RepeatsDB database (URL: https://repeatsdb.org/) provides annotations and classification for protein tandem repeat structures from the Protein Data Bank (PDB). Protein tandem repeats are ubiquitous in all branches of the tree of life. The accumulation of solved repeat structures provides new possibilities for classification and detection, but also increasing the need for annotation. Here we present RepeatsDB 3.0, which addresses these challenges and presents an extended classification scheme. The major conceptual change compared to the previous version is the hierarchical classification combining top levels based solely on structural similarity (Class > Topology > Fold) with two new levels (Clan > Family) requiring sequence similarity and describing repeat motifs in collaboration with Pfam. Data growth has been addressed with improved mechanisms for browsing the classification hierarchy. A new UniProt-centric view unifies the increasingly frequent annotation of structures from identical or similar sequences. This update of RepeatsDB aligns with our commitment to develop a resource that extracts, organizes and distributes specialized information on tandem repeat protein structures.",hji,,1,1,1,1.0,,

The cultural wisdom of processing raw ingredients into delicious dishes is embodied in their cuisines. Recipes thus are the cultural capsules that encode elaborate cooking protocols for evoking sensory satiation as well as providing nourishment. As we stand on the verge of an epidemic of diet-linked disorders, it is eminently important to investigate the culinary correlates of recipes to probe their association with sensory responses as well as consequences for nutrition and health. RecipeDB (https://cosylab.iiitd.edu.in/recipedb) is a structured compilation of recipes, ingredients and nutrition profiles interlinked with flavor profiles and health associations. The repertoire comprises of meticulous integration of 118‚Äâ171 recipes from cuisines across the globe (6 continents, 26 geocultural regions and 74 countries), cooked using 268 processes (heat, cook, boil, simmer, bake, etc.), by blending over 20‚Äâ262 diverse ingredients, which are further linked to their flavor molecules (FlavorDB), nutritional profiles (US Department of Agriculture) and empirical records of disease associations obtained from MEDLINE (DietRx).

Recent genetic studies showed the existence of autosomal dominant de novo GRIN gene variants associated with GRIN-related disorders (GRDs), a rare pediatric neurological disorder caused by N-methyl- d-aspartate receptor (NMDAR) dysfunction. Notwithstanding, GRIN variants identification is exponentially growing and their clinical, genetic, and functional annotations remain highly fragmented, representing a bottleneck in GRD patient's stratification. To shorten the gap between GRIN variant identification and patient stratification, we present the GRIN database (GRINdb), a publicly available, nonredundant, updated, and curated database gathering all available genetic, functional, and clinical data from more than 4000 GRIN variants. The manually curated GRINdb outputs on a web server, allowing query and retrieval of reported GRIN variants, and thus representing a fast and reliable bioinformatics resource for molecular clinical advice. Furthermore, the comprehensive mapping of GRIN variants' genetic and clinical information along NMDAR structure revealed important differences in GRIN variants' pathogenicity and clinical phenotypes, shedding light on GRIN-specific fingerprints.

While comprehensive image maps exist for some organs, most resources have limited support for multiplexed imaging or have non-intuitive user interfaces. Therefore, we built a Pancreatlas resource that integrates several technologies into a unique interface, allowing users to access richly annotated web pages, drill down to individual images, and deeply explore data online. The current version of Pancreatlas contains over 800 unique images acquired by whole-slide scanning, confocal microscopy, and imaging mass cytometry, and is available at https://www.pancreatlas.org.

33301927,Phylogenomic study and classification of mitochondrial DNA through virtual genomic fingerprints.,"In the present study, we evaluated the ability of the Virtual Analysis Method for Phylogenomic fingerprint Estimation (VAMPhyRE) toolkit to classify human mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) haplogroups. In total, 357 random mtDNA sequences were obtained from different haplogroups, based on the classification of PhyloTree. Additionally, we included a control group of five sequences (Pan paniscus, Pan troglodytes, Homo sapiens neanderthalensis, Yoruba15, and the revised Cambridge reference sequence). VAMPhyRE employs a virtual hybridization technique, using probes that specifically bind to their complementary sequences in the genome. We used 65,536 probes of 8 nucleotides to identify potential sites where hybridization occurs between the mtDNA and the specific probe, forming different heteroduplexes and thus, creating a unique and specific genomic fingerprint for each sequence. Genomic fingerprints were compared, and a table of distances was calculated to obtain a mitochondrial phylogenomic tree with the macrohaplogroups, L, N, M, and R, and their corresponding haplogroups, according to universal nomenclature. The results obtained suggest an accuracy of 97.25% for the distribution of the 357 mtDNA sequences in the four macrohaplogroups and their corresponding haplogroups when compared with other mtDNA classification tools that require reference sequences and do not offer an analysis based on an evolutionary approach.

Expression quantitative trait locus (eQTL) analysis has been demonstrated to help reveal the genetic mechanism of single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in cancer etiology. However, there are no databases that have been constructed to provide an eQTL analysis between SNPs and piRNA expression. In this study, we collected genotyping and piRNA expression data for 10 997 samples across 33 cancer types from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA). Using linear regression cis-eQTL analysis with adjustment of appropriate covariates, we identified millions of SNP-piRNA pairs in tumor (76 924 831) and normal (24 431 061) tissues. Further, we performed differential expression and survival analyses, and linked the eQTLs to genome-wide association study (GWAS) data to comprehensively decipher the functional roles of identified cis-piRNA eQTLs. Finally, we developed a user-friendly database, piRNA-eQTL (http://njmu-edu.cn:3838/piRNA-eQTL/), to help users query, browse and download corresponding eQTL results. In summary, piRNA-eQTL could serve as an important resource to assist the research community in understanding the roles of genetic variants and piRNAs in the development of cancers.",hji,,1,1,1,1.0,,

Currently, there are urgent needs for the systematic annotations of A-to-I RNA editing events in AD. Here, we built ADeditome, the annotation database of A-to-I RNA editing in AD available at https://ccsm.uth.edu/ADeditome, aiming to provide a resource and reference for functional annotation of A-to-I RNA editing in AD to identify therapeutically targetable genes in an individual. We detected 1676 363 editing sites in 1524 samples across nine brain regions from ROSMAP, MayoRNAseq and MSBB. For these editing events, we performed multiple functional annotations including identification of specific and disease stage associated editing events and the influence of editing events on gene expression, protein recoding, alternative splicing and miRNA regulation for all the genes, especially for AD-related genes in order to explore the pathology of AD. Combing all the analysis results, we found 108 010 and 26 168 editing events which may promote or inhibit AD progression, respectively. We also found 5582 brain region-specific editing events with potentially dual roles in AD across different brain regions. ADeditome will be a unique resource for AD and drug research communities to identify therapeutically targetable editing events.

Given the challenge to target those interfaces with small chemical compounds, it has become clear that learning from successful examples of PPI modulation is a powerful strategy. Freely-accessible databases of PPI modulators that provide the community with tractable chemical and pharmacological data, as well as powerful tools to query them, are therefore essential to stimulate new drug discovery projects on PPI targets.<h4>Results</h4>Here, we present the new version iPPI-DB, our manually curated database of PPI modulators.

33461215,Ligand-based approach for predicting drug targets and for virtual screening against COVID-19.,"Discovering efficient drugs and identifying target proteins are still an unmet but urgent need for curing coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). Protein structure-based docking is a widely applied approach for discovering active compounds against drug targets and for predicting potential targets of active compounds. However, this approach has its inherent deficiency caused by e.g. various different conformations with largely varied binding pockets adopted by proteins, or the lack of true target proteins in the database. This deficiency may result in false negative results. As a complementary approach to the protein structure-based platform for COVID-19, termed as D3Docking in our previous work, we developed in this study a ligand-based method, named D3Similarity, which is based on the molecular similarity evaluation between the submitted molecule(s) and those in an active compound database. The database is constituted by all the reported bioactive molecules against the coronaviruses, viz., severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS), Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS), severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), human betacoronavirus 2c EMC/2012 (HCoV-EMC), human CoV 229E (HCoV-229E) and feline infectious peritonitis virus (FIPV), some of which have target or mechanism information but some do not. Based on the two-dimensional (2D) and three-dimensional (3D) similarity evaluation of molecular structures, virtual screening and target prediction could be performed according to similarity ranking results. With two examples, we demonstrated the reliability and efficiency of D3Similarity by using 2D‚Äâ√ó‚Äâ3D value as score for drug discovery and target prediction against COVID-19.

New approaches are urgently needed to prioritize variants, especially those that are rare or lack a definitive clinical interpretation. We examined 10,136,597 human missense genetic variants from GnomAD, ClinVar and UniProt. We were able to perform large-scale atom-based mapping and phenotype interpretation of 3,960,015 of these variants onto 18,874 experimental and 84,818 in house predicted three-dimensional coordinates of the human proteome. We demonstrate that 14% of amino acid substitutions from the GnomAD database that could be structurally analysed are predicted to affect protein structure (n‚Äâ=‚Äâ568,548, of which 566,439 rare or extremely rare) and may, therefore, have a yet unknown disease-causing effect.

As the most species-rich group of sexually reproducing organisms on Earth, insects have multiple sex determination systems. Though sex chromosomes and sex-biased genes are well-studied in dozens of insects, their gene sequences are scattered in various databases. Moreover, a shortage of annotation hinders the deep mining of these data. Here, we collected the chromosome-level sex chromosome data of 49 insect species, including 34 X chromosomes, 15 Z chromosomes, 5 W chromosomes and 2 Y chromosomes.

However, current human-virus PPI database resources are incomplete, lack annotation and usually do not provide the opportunity to computationally predict human-virus PPIs. Here, we present the Human-Virus Interaction DataBase (HVIDB, http://zzdlab.com/hvidb/) that provides comprehensively annotated human-virus PPI data as well as seamlessly integrates online PPI prediction tools. Currently, HVIDB highlights 48 643 experimentally verified human-virus PPIs covering 35 virus families, 6633 virally targeted host complexes, 3572 host dependency/restriction factors as well as 911 experimentally verified/predicted 3D complex structures of human-virus PPIs. Furthermore, our database resource provides tissue-specific expression profiles of 6790 human genes that are targeted by viruses and 129 Gene Expression Omnibus series of differentially expressed genes post-viral infections. Based on these multifaceted and annotated data, our database allows the users to easily obtain reliable information about PPIs of various human viruses and conduct an in-depth analysis of their inherent biological significance. In particular, HVIDB also integrates well-performing machine learning models to predict interactions between the human host and viral proteins that are based on (i) sequence embedding techniques, (ii) interolog mapping and (iii) domain-domain interaction inference.

Diamond and InterproScan were used to discover 72,266 PUFs for all organisms. RNA-seq datasets related to abiotic stresses were downloaded from NCBI/GEO. The RNA-seq data was used as input to the LSTrAP software to construct co-expression networks. LSTrAP also created clusters of transcripts with correlated expression, whose members are more probably related to the molecular mechanisms associated with abiotic stresses in the plants. Orthologous groups were created (OrhtoMCL) using all 2,332,974 proteins in order to associate PUFs to abiotic stress-related clusters of co-expression and therefore infer their function in a guilt-by-association manner. A freely available web resource named ""Plant Co-expression Annotation Resource"" ( https://www.machado.cnptia.embrapa.br/plantannot ), Plantannot, was created to provide indexed queries to search for PUF putatively associated with abiotic stresses. The web interface also allows browsing, querying, and retrieving of public genomics data from 53 plants. We hope Plantannot to be useful for researchers trying to obtain novel GM crops resistant to climate change hazards.",hji,,1,1,1,1.0,,value add
33547946,Web resource on available DNA variant tests for hereditary diseases and genetic predispositions in dogs and cats: An Update.,"Vast progress has been made in the clinical diagnosis and molecular basis of hereditary diseases and genetic predisposition in companion animals. The purpose of this report is to provide an update on the availability of DNA testing for hereditary diseases and genetic predispositions in dogs and cats utilizing the WSAVA-PennGen DNA Testing Database web resource (URL: http://research.vet.upenn.edu/WSAVA-LabSearch ). Information on hereditary diseases, DNA tests, genetic testing laboratories and afflicted breeds added to the web-based WSAVA-PennGen DNA Testing Database was gathered. Following verification through original research and clinical studies, searching various databases on hereditary diseases in dogs and cats, and contacting laboratories offering DNA tests, the data were compared to the resource reported on in 2013. The number of molecularly defined Mendelian inherited diseases and variants in companion animals listed in the WSAVA-PennGen DNA Testing Database in 2020 drastically increased by 112% and 141%, respectively. The number of DNA variant tests offered by each laboratory has also doubled for dogs and cats. While the overall number of laboratories has only slightly increased from 43 to 47, the number of larger corporate laboratories increased, while academic laboratories have declined. In addition, there are now several laboratories that are offering breed-specific or all-breed panel tests rather than single-DNA tests for dogs and cats. This unique regularly updated searchable web-based database allows veterinary clinicians, breeders and pet owners to readily find available DNA tests, laboratories performing these DNA tests worldwide, and canine and feline breeds afflicted and also serves as a valuable resource for comparative geneticists.",hji,,1,1,1,1.0,,
33581334,OGP: A Repository of Experimentally Characterized O-Glycoproteins to Facilitate Studies on O-Glycosylation.,"Numerous studies on cancer, biopharmaceuticals, and clinical trials have necessitated comprehensive and precise analysis of protein O-glycosylation. However, the lack of updated and convenient databases deters the storage of and reference to emerging O-glycoprotein data. To resolve this issue, an O-glycoprotein repository named OGP was established in this work. It was constructed with a collection of O-glycoprotein data from different sources. OGP contains 9354 O-glycosylation sites and 11,633 site-specific O-glycans mapping to 2133 O-glycoproteins, and it is the largest O-glycoprotein repository thus far. Based on the recorded O-glycosylation sites, an O-glycosylation site prediction tool was developed. Moreover, an OGP-based website is already available (http://www.oglyp.org/). The website comprises four specially designed and user-friendly modules: statistical analysis, database search, site prediction, and data submission. The first version of OGP repository and the website allow users to obtain various O-glycoprotein-related information, such as protein accession numbers, O-glycosylation sites, glycopeptide sequences, site-specific glycan structures, experimental methods, and potential O-glycosylation sites. O-glycosylation data mining can be performed efficiently on this website, which will greatly facilitate related studies. In addition, the database is accessible from OGP website (http://www.oglyp.org/download.php).",hji,,1,1,1,1.0,,

Natural language processing enhances the access to relevant information, and gold standard corpora are required to improve systems. To contribute with a new dataset for this domain, we collected the Clinical Trials for Evidence-Based Medicine in Spanish (CT-EBM-SP) corpus.<h4>Methods</h4>We annotated 1200 texts about clinical trials with entities from the Unified Medical Language System semantic groups: anatomy (ANAT), pharmacological and chemical substances (CHEM), pathologies (DISO), and lab tests, diagnostic or therapeutic procedures (PROC). We doubly annotated 10% of the corpus and measured inter-annotator agreement (IAA) using F-measure. As use case, we run medical entity recognition experiments with neural network models.<h4>Results</h4>This resource contains 500 abstracts of journal articles about clinical trials and 700 announcements of trial protocols (292 173 tokens). We annotated 46 699 entities (13.98% are nested entities). Regarding IAA agreement, we obtained an average F-measure of 85.65% (¬±4.79, strict match) and 93.94% (¬±3.31, relaxed match). In the use case experiments, we achieved recognition results ranging from 80.28% (¬±00.99) to 86.74% (¬±00.19) of average F-measure.<h4>Conclusions</h4>Our results show that this resource is adequate for experiments with state-of-the-art approaches to biomedical named entity recognition.

33643383,Abiotic Stress-Responsive miRNA and Transcription Factor-Mediated Gene Regulatory Network in <i>Oryza sativa</i>: Construction and Structural Measure Study.,"Climate changes and environmental stresses have a consequential association with crop plant growth and yield, meaning it is necessary to cultivate crops that have tolerance toward the changing climate and environmental disturbances such as water stress, temperature fluctuation, and salt toxicity. Recent studies have shown that trans-acting regulatory elements, including microRNAs (miRNAs) and transcription factors (TFs), are emerging as promising tools for engineering naive improved crop varieties with tolerance for multiple environmental stresses and enhanced quality as well as yield. However, the interwoven complex regulatory function of TFs and miRNAs at transcriptional and post-transcriptional levels is unexplored in <i>Oryza sativa</i>. To this end, we have constructed a multiple abiotic stress responsive TF-miRNA-gene regulatory network for <i>O. sativa</i> using a transcriptome and degradome sequencing data meta-analysis approach. The theoretical network approach has shown the networks to be dense, scale-free, and small-world, which makes the network stable. They are also invariant to scale change where an efficient, quick transmission of biological signals occurs within the network on extrinsic hindrance. The analysis also deciphered the existence of communities (cluster of TF, miRNA, and genes) working together to help plants in acclimatizing to multiple stresses. It highlighted that genes, TFs, and miRNAs shared by multiple stress conditions that work as hubs or bottlenecks for signal propagation, for example, during the interaction between stress-responsive genes (TFs/miRNAs/other genes) and genes involved in floral development pathways under multiple environmental stresses. This study further highlights how the fine-tuning feedback mechanism works for balancing stress tolerance and how timely flowering enable crops to survive in adverse conditions. This study developed the abiotic stress-responsive regulatory network, APRegNet database (http://lms.snu.edu.in/APRegNet), which may help researchers studying the roles of miRNAs and TFs. Furthermore, it advances current understanding of multiple abiotic stress tolerance mechanisms.",hji,,1,1,1,1.0,,

This has given rise to several mutation predictor tools that, in general, do not consider the specificities of the various protein groups. We aimed to develop a predictor tool dedicated to membrane proteins, under the premise that their specific structural features and environment would give different responses to mutations compared to globular proteins. For this purpose, we created TMSNP, a database that currently contains information from 2624 pathogenic and 196 705 non-pathogenic reported mutations located in the transmembrane region of membrane proteins. By computing various conservation parameters on these mutations in combination with annotations, we trained a machine-learning model able to classify mutations as pathogenic or not. TMSNP (freely available at http://lmc.uab.es/tmsnp/) improves considerably the prediction power of commonly used mutation predictors trained with globular proteins.",hji,,1,1,1,1.0,,

However, none of these has yet collected experimental results of compound-related health changes. Since quality of life is often regarded as more valuable than length of life, we aim to fill this gap with the ""Healthy Worm Database"" ( http://healthy-worm-database.eu ). Literature describing health-related compound studies in the aging model Caenorhabditis elegans was screened, and data for 440 compounds collected. The database considers 189 publications describing 89 different phenotypes measured in 2995 different conditions. Besides enabling a targeted search for promising compounds for further investigations, this database also offers insights into the research field of studies on healthy aging based on a frequently used model organism. Some weaknesses of C. elegans-based aging studies, like underrepresented phenotypes, especially concerning cognitive functions, as well as the convenience-based use of young worms as the starting point for compound treatment or phenotype measurement are discussed. In conclusion, the database provides an anchor for the search for compounds affecting health, with a link to public databases, and it further highlights some potential shortcomings in current aging research.",hji,,1,1,1,1.0,,
33685383,lncRNADetector: a bioinformatics pipeline for long non-coding RNA identification and MAPslnc: a repository of medicinal and aromatic plant lncRNAs.,"Long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) are an emerging class of non-coding RNAs and potent regulatory elements in the living cells. High throughput RNA sequencing analyses have generated a tremendous amount of transcript sequence data. A large proportion of these transcript sequences does not code for proteins and are known as non-coding RNAs. Among them, lncRNAs are a unique class of transcripts longer than 200 nucleotides with diverse biological functions and regulatory mechanisms. Recent emerging studies and next-generation sequencing technologies show a substantial amount of lncRNAs within the plant genome, which are yet to be identified. The computational identification of lncRNAs from these transcripts is a challenging task due to the involvement of a series of filtering steps. We have developed lncRNADetector, a bioinformatics pipeline for the identification of novel lncRNAs, especially from medicinal and aromatic plant (MAP) species. The lncRNADetector has been utilized to analyse and identify more than 88,459 lncRNAs from 21 species of MAPs. To provide a knowledge resource for the plant research community towards elucidating the diversity of biological roles of lncRNAs, the information generated about MAP lncRNAs (post-filtering steps) through lncRNADetector has been stored and organized in MAPslnc database (MAPslnc, https://lncrnapipe.cimap.res.in). The lncRNADetector web server and MAPslnc database have been developed in order to facilitate researchers for accurate identification of lncRNAs from the next-generation sequencing data of different organisms for downstream studies.

33757430,ATAV: a comprehensive platform for population-scale genomic analyses.,"<h4>Background</h4>A common approach for sequencing studies is to do joint-calling and store variants of all samples in a single file. If new samples are continually added or controls are re-used for several studies, the cost and time required to perform joint-calling for each analysis can become prohibitive.<h4>Results</h4>We present ATAV, an analysis platform for large-scale whole-exome and whole-genome sequencing projects. ATAV stores variant and per site coverage data for all samples in a centralized database, which is efficiently queried by ATAV to support diagnostic analyses for trios and singletons, as well as rare-variant collapsing analyses for finding disease associations in complex diseases. Runtime logs ensure full reproducibility and the modularized ATAV framework makes it extensible to continuous development. Besides helping with the identification of disease-causing variants for a range of diseases, ATAV has also enabled the discovery of disease-genes by rare-variant collapsing on datasets containing more than 20,000 samples. Analyses to date have been performed on data of more than 110,000 individuals demonstrating the scalability of the framework. To allow users to easily access variant-level data directly from the database, we provide a web-based interface, the ATAV data browser ( http://atavdb.org/ ). Through this browser, summary-level data for more than 40,000 samples can be queried by the general public representing a mix of cases and controls of diverse ancestries. Users have access to phenotype categories of variant carriers, as well as predicted ancestry, gender, and quality metrics. In contrast to many other platforms, the data browser is able to show data of newly-added samples in real-time and therefore evolves rapidly as more and more samples are sequenced.<h4>Conclusions</h4>Through ATAV, users have public access to one of the largest variant databases for patients sequenced at a tertiary care center and can look up any genes or variants of interest. Additionally, since the entire code is freely available on GitHub, ATAV can easily be deployed by other groups that wish to build their own platform, database, and user interface.",hji,,1,1,1,1.0,,
33780471,MCPdb: The bacterial microcompartment database.,"Bacterial microcompartments are organelle-like structures composed entirely of proteins. They have evolved to carry out several distinct and specialized metabolic functions in a wide variety of bacteria. Their outer shell is constructed from thousands of tessellating protein subunits, encapsulating enzymes that carry out the internal metabolic reactions. The shell proteins are varied, with single, tandem and permuted versions of the PF00936 protein family domain comprising the primary structural component of their polyhedral architecture, which is reminiscent of a viral capsid. While considerable amounts of structural and biophysical data have been generated in the last 15 years, the existing functionalities of current resources have limited our ability to rapidly understand the functional and structural properties of microcompartments (MCPs) and their diversity. In order to make the remarkable structural features of bacterial microcompartments accessible to a broad community of scientists and non-specialists, we developed MCPdb: The Bacterial Microcompartment Database (https://mcpdb.mbi.ucla.edu/). MCPdb is a comprehensive resource that categorizes and organizes known microcompartment protein structures and their larger assemblies. To emphasize the critical roles symmetric assembly and architecture play in microcompartment function, each structure in the MCPdb is validated and annotated with respect to: (1) its predicted natural assembly state (2) tertiary structure and topology and (3) the metabolic compartment type from which it derives. The current database includes 163 structures and is available to the public with the anticipation that it will serve as a growing resource for scientists interested in understanding protein-based metabolic organelles in bacteria.",hji,,1,1,1,1.0,,
33784373,Bioinformatics tools developed to support BioCompute Objects.,"Developments in high-throughput sequencing (HTS) result in an exponential increase in the amount of data generated by sequencing experiments, an increase in the complexity of bioinformatics analysis reporting and an increase in the types of data generated. These increases in volume, diversity and complexity of the data generated and their analysis expose the necessity of a structured and standardized reporting template. BioCompute Objects (BCOs) provide the requisite support for communication of HTS data analysis that includes support for workflow, as well as data, curation, accessibility and reproducibility of communication. BCOs standardize how researchers report provenance and the established verification and validation protocols used in workflows while also being robust enough to convey content integration or curation in knowledge bases. BCOs that encapsulate tools, platforms, datasets and workflows are FAIR (findable, accessible, interoperable and reusable) compliant. Providing operational workflow and data information facilitates interoperability between platforms and incorporation of future dataset within an HTS analysis for use within industrial, academic and regulatory settings. Cloud-based platforms, including High-performance Integrated Virtual Environment (HIVE), Cancer Genomics Cloud (CGC) and Galaxy, support BCO generation for users. Given the 100K+ userbase between these platforms, BioCompute can be leveraged for workflow documentation. In this paper, we report the availability of platform-dependent and platform-independent BCO tools: HIVE BCO App, CGC BCO App, Galaxy BCO API Extension and BCO Portal. Community engagement was utilized to evaluate tool efficacy. We demonstrate that these tools further advance BCO creation from text editing approaches used in earlier releases of the standard. Moreover, we demonstrate that integrating BCO generation within existing analysis platforms greatly streamlines BCO creation while capturing granular workflow details. We also demonstrate that the BCO tools described in the paper provide an approach to solve the long-standing challenge of standardizing workflow descriptions that are both human and machine readable while accommodating manual and automated curation with evidence tagging.

33843105,Sequence and evolutionary analysis of bacterial ribosomal S1 proteins.,"The multi-domain bacterial S1 protein is the largest and most functionally important ribosomal protein of the 30S subunit, which interacts with both mRNA and proteins. The family of ribosomal S1 proteins differs in the classical sense from a protein with tandem repeats and has a ""bead-on-string"" organization, where each repeat is folded into a globular domain. Based on our recent data, the study of evolutionary relationships for the bacterial phyla will provide evidence for one of the proposed theories of the evolutionary development of proteins with structural repeats: from multiple repeats of assembles to single repeats, or vice versa. In this comparative analysis of 1333 S1 sequences that were identified in 24 different phyla, we demonstrate how such phyla can form independently/dependently during evolution. To the best of our knowledge, this work is the first study of the evolutionary history of bacterial ribosomal S1 proteins. The collected and structured data can be useful to computer biologists as a resource for determining percent identity, amino acid composition and logo motifs, as well as dN/dS ratio in bacterial S1 protein.

The goal of those studies is to translate the findings from in vitro studies of cancer cell lines into in vivo therapeutic relevance and, eventually, patients' care. Tremendous progress has been made.<h4>Results</h4>In this work, we built predictive models for 453 drugs using data on gene expression and drug sensitivity (IC<sub>50</sub>) from cancer cell lines. We identified many known drug-gene interactions and uncovered several potentially novel drug-gene associations. Importantly, we further applied these predictive models to ~‚Äâ17,000 bulk RNA-seq samples from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) and the Genotype-Tissue Expression (GTEx) database to predict drug sensitivity for both normal and tumor tissues. We created a web site for users to visualize and download our predicted data ( https://manticore.niehs.nih.gov/cancerRxTissue ). Using trametinib as an example, we showed that our approach can faithfully recapitulate the known tumor specificity of the drug.<h4>Conclusions</h4>We demonstrated that our approach can predict drugs that 1) are tumor-type specific; 2) elicit higher sensitivity from tumor compared to corresponding normal tissue; 3) elicit differential sensitivity across breast cancer subtypes.

33858848,HLA Ligand Atlas: a benign reference of HLA-presented peptides to improve T-cell-based cancer immunotherapy.,"<h4>Background</h4>The human leucocyte antigen (HLA) complex controls adaptive immunity by presenting defined fractions of the intracellular and extracellular protein content to immune cells. Understanding the benign HLA ligand repertoire is a prerequisite to define safe T-cell-based immunotherapies against cancer. Due to the poor availability of benign tissues, if available, normal tissue adjacent to the tumor has been used as a benign surrogate when defining tumor-associated antigens. However, this comparison has proven to be insufficient and even resulted in lethal outcomes. In order to match the tumor immunopeptidome with an equivalent counterpart, we created the HLA Ligand Atlas, the first extensive collection of paired HLA-I and HLA-II immunopeptidomes from 227 benign human tissue samples. This dataset facilitates a balanced comparison between tumor and benign tissues on HLA ligand level.<h4>Methods</h4>Human tissue samples were obtained from 16 subjects at autopsy, five thymus samples and two ovary samples originating from living donors. HLA ligands were isolated via immunoaffinity purification and analyzed in over 1200 liquid chromatography mass spectrometry runs. Experimentally and computationally reproducible protocols were employed for data acquisition and processing.<h4>Results</h4>The initial release covers 51 HLA-I and 86 HLA-II allotypes presenting 90,428 HLA-I- and 142,625 HLA-II ligands. The HLA allotypes are representative for the world population. We observe that immunopeptidomes differ considerably between tissues and individuals on source protein and HLA-ligand level. Moreover, we discover 1407 HLA-I ligands from non-canonical genomic regions. Such peptides were previously described in tumors, peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs), healthy lung tissues and cell lines. In a case study in glioblastoma, we show that potential on-target off-tumor adverse events in immunotherapy can be avoided by comparing tumor immunopeptidomes to the provided multi-tissue reference.<h4>Conclusion</h4>Given that T-cell-based immunotherapies, such as CAR-T cells, affinity-enhanced T cell transfer, cancer vaccines and immune checkpoint inhibition, have significant side effects, the HLA Ligand Atlas is the first step toward defining tumor-associated targets with an improved safety profile. The resource provides insights into basic and applied immune-associated questions in the context of cancer immunotherapy, infection, transplantation, allergy and autoimmunity.

33876217,CanDriS: posterior profiling of cancer-driving sites based on two-component evolutionary model.,"Current cancer genomics databases have accumulated millions of somatic mutations that remain to be further explored. Due to the over-excess mutations unrelated to cancer, the great challenge is to identify somatic mutations that are cancer-driven. Under the notion that carcinogenesis is a form of somatic-cell evolution, we developed a two-component mixture model: while the ground component corresponds to passenger mutations, the rapidly evolving component corresponds to driver mutations. Then, we implemented an empirical Bayesian procedure to calculate the posterior probability of a site being cancer-driven. Based on these, we developed a software CanDriS (Cancer Driver Sites) to profile the potential cancer-driving sites for thousands of tumor samples from the Cancer Genome Atlas and International Cancer Genome Consortium across tumor types and pan-cancer level. As a result, we identified that approximately 1% of the sites have posterior probabilities larger than 0.90 and listed potential cancer-wide and cancer-specific driver mutations. By comprehensively profiling all potential cancer-driving sites, CanDriS greatly enhances our ability to refine our knowledge of the genetic basis of cancer and might guide clinical medication in the upcoming era of precision medicine.

The goal of PhenX is to facilitate the use of standard measures, enhance data interoperability, and promote collaborative and translational research. PhenX is driven by the scientific community and historically has depended on working groups of experts to recommend measures for release in the PhenX Toolkit. The urgent need for recommended, standard measures for COVID-19 research triggered the development of a ""rapid release"" process for releasing new content in the PhenX Toolkit. Initially, PhenX collaborated with the National Institutes of Health (NIH) Office of Behavioral and Social Sciences Research, the National Human Genome Research Institute, and the NIH Disaster Research Response (DR2) program to create a library of COVID-19 measurement protocols. With additional support from NIH, PhenX adapted crowdsourcing techniques to accelerate prioritization and recommendation of protocols for release in the PhenX Toolkit. Prioritized COVID-19-specific protocols were used to anchor and define specialty collections of protocols that were subject to review and approval by the PhenX Steering Committee. In addition to the COVID-19-specific protocols, the specialty collections include existing, well-established PhenX protocols, use of which will further enhance data interoperability and cross-study analysis.

33942874,Human IRES Atlas: an integrative platform for studying IRES-driven translational regulation in humans.,"It is now known that cap-independent translation initiation facilitated by internal ribosome entry sites (IRESs) is vital in selective cellular protein synthesis under stress and different physiological conditions. However, three problems make it hard to understand transcriptome-wide cellular IRES-mediated translation initiation mechanisms: (i) complex interplay between IRESs and other translation initiation-related information, (ii) reliability issue of in silico cellular IRES investigation and (iii) labor-intensive in vivo IRES identification. In this research, we constructed the Human IRES Atlas database for a comprehensive understanding of cellular IRESs in humans. First, currently available and suitable IRES prediction tools (IRESfinder, PatSearch and IRESpy) were used to obtain transcriptome-wide human IRESs. Then, we collected eight genres of translation initiation-related features to help study the potential molecular mechanisms of each of the putative IRESs. Three functional tests (conservation, structural RNA-protein scores and conditional translation efficiency) were devised to evaluate the functionality of the identified putative IRESs. Moreover, an easy-to-use interface and an IRES-translation initiation interaction map for each gene transcript were implemented to help understand the interactions between IRESs and translation initiation-related features. Researchers can easily search/browse an IRES of interest using the web interface and deduce testable mechanism hypotheses of human IRES-driven translation initiation based on the integrated results. In summary, Human IRES Atlas integrates putative IRES elements and translation initiation-related experiments for better usage of these data and deduction of mechanism hypotheses.

This includes publicly available and user generated data, hence Trips-Viz can be classified as a database and as a server. As a database it provides access to many processed Ribo-Seq and RNA-seq data aligned to reference transcriptomes which has been expanded considerably since its inception. Here, we focus on the server functionality of Trips-viz which also has been greatly improved. Trips-viz now enables visualisation of proteomics data from a large number of processed mass spectrometry datasets. It can be used to support translation inferred from Ribo-Seq data. Users are now able to upload a custom reference transcriptome as well as data types other than Ribo-Seq/RNA-Seq. Incorporating custom data has been streamlined with RiboGalaxy (https://ribogalaxy.ucc.ie/) integration. The other new functionality is the rapid detection of translated open reading frames (ORFs) through a simple easy to use interface. The analysis of differential expression has been also improved via integration of DESeq2 and Anota2seq in addition to a number of other improvements of existing Trips-viz features.",hji,,1,1,1,1.0,,

It is freely available, and since its inception in 2015, the database has become an important resource to several studies. Its content has been: used as training data for machine learning models; incorporated to larger databases; and utilized in drug discovery studies for hit identifications.<h4>Description</h4>Here, we report the updated version of SANCDB. The new version includes 412 additional compounds that have been reported since 2015, giving a total of 1012 compounds in the database. Further, although natural products (NPs) are an important source of unique scaffolds, they have a major drawback due to their complex structure resulting in low synthetic feasibility in the laboratory. With this in mind, SANCDB is, now, updated to provide direct links to commercially available analogs from two major chemical databases namely Mcule and MolPort. To our knowledge, this feature is not available in other NP databases. Additionally, for easier access to information by users, the database and website interface were updated. The compounds are now downloadable in many different chemical formats.<h4>Conclusions</h4>The drug discovery process relies heavily on NPs due to their unique chemical organization. This has inspired the establishment of numerous NP chemical databases. With the emergence of newer chemoinformatic technologies, existing chemical databases require constant updates to facilitate information accessibility and integration by users. Besides increasing the NPs compound content, the updated SANCDB allows users to access the individual compounds (if available) or their analogs from commercial databases seamlessly.",hji,,1,1,1,1.0,,

These resources differ both in the methodologies used and in the species they make predictions for. The HGNC Comparison of Orthology Predictions (HCOP) search tool integrates and displays data from multiple ortholog prediction resources for a specified human gene or set of genes. An indication of the reliability of a prediction is provided by the number of resources that support it. HCOP was originally designed to show orthology predictions between human and mouse but has been expanded to include data from a current total of 20 selected vertebrate and model organism species. The HCOP pipeline used to fetch and integrate the information from the disparate ortholog and nomenclature data resources has recently been rewritten, both to enable the inclusion of new data and to take advantage of modern web technologies.

Situations are similar for other crop species such as garden asparagus (Asparagus officinalis), chickpea (Cicer arietinum) and Tartary buckwheat (Fagopyrum tataricum). The objective of the data presented here was to improve functional annotations of genes of pearl millet, garden asparagus, chickpea and Tartary buckwheat with gene annotations of model plants, to systematically provide such annotations as well as their sequences on a website, and thereby to promote genomics for those crops.<h4>Data description</h4>Sequences of genomes and transcripts of pearl millet, garden asparagus, chickpea and Tartary buckwheat were downloaded from a public database. These transcripts were associated with functional annotations of their Arabidopsis thaliana and rice (Oryza sativa) counterparts identified by BLASTX.

Therefore, an information portal for storing TUP data is urgently needed. Here, we present a TUP data bank (TUPDB), which is a comprehensive, manually curated database of approximately 73 experimentally verified TUPs and 1963 potential TUPs collected from TUPScan, the BDB database, and public research articles. The TUPScan tool has been integrated in TUPDB to facilitate TUP analysis. We believe that TUPDB can help identify and remove TUPs in future reports in the biopanning community.

Since the discovery of EV production in the fungus <i>Cryptococcus neoformans</i>, the importance of EV release in its physiology and pathogenicity has been investigated. To date, few studies have investigated the proteomic content of EVs from multiple fungal species. Our main objective was to use an orthology approach to compare proteins identified by EV shotgun proteomics in 8 pathogenic and 1 nonpathogenic species. Using protein information from the UniProt and FungiDB databases, we integrated data for 11,433 hits in fungal EVs with an orthology perspective, resulting in 3,834 different orthologous groups. OG6_100083 (Hsp70 Pfam domain) was the unique orthologous group that was identified for all fungal species. Proteins with this protein domain are associated with the stress response, survival and morphological changes in different fungal species. Although no pathogenic orthologous group was found, we identified 5 orthologous groups exclusive to <i>S. cerevisiae</i>. Using the criteria of at least 7 pathogenic fungi to define a cluster, we detected the 4 unique pathogenic orthologous groups. Taken together, our data suggest that Hsp70-related proteins might play a key role in fungal EVs, regardless of the pathogenic status. Using an orthology approach, we identified at least 4 protein domains that could be novel therapeutic targets against pathogenic fungi. Our results were compiled in the herein described ExVe database, which is publicly available at http://exve.icc.fiocruz.br.",hji,,1,1,1,1.0,,

While the resource primarily serves the echinoderm research community, the recent release of an excellent quality genome for the frequently studied purple sea urchin (Strongylocentrotus purpuratus genome, v5.0) has provided an opportunity to adapt to the needs of a broader research community across other model systems. To this end, establishing pipelines to identify orthologous genes between echinoderms and other species has become a priority in many contexts including nomenclature, linking to data in other model organisms, and in internal functionality where data gathered in one hosted species can be associated with genes in other hosted echinoderms. This paper describes the orthology pipelines currently employed by Echinobase and how orthology data are processed to yield 1:1 ortholog mappings between a variety of echinoderms and other model taxa. We also describe functions of interest that have recently been included on the resource, including an updated developmental time course for S.purpuratus, and additional tracks for genome browsing.

Here, we describe a novel approach to establish identity and compatibility of reference genome resources. We approach this with three advances: first, we derive unique identifiers for each resource; second, we record parent-child relationships among resources; and third, we describe recursive identifiers that determine identity as well as compatibility of coordinate systems and sequence names.

The characteristics of eukaryotic replication origins are best understood in Saccharomyces cerevisiae. For this species, origin prediction algorithms or web servers have been developed based on the sequence features of autonomously replicating sequences (ARSs). However, their performances are far from satisfactory. By utilizing the Z-curve methodology, we present a novel pipeline, Ori-Finder 3, for the computational prediction of replication origins in S. cerevisiae at the genome-wide level based solely on DNA sequences. The ARS exhibiting both an AT-rich stretch and ARS consensus sequence element can be predicted at the single-nucleotide level. For the identified ARSs in the S. cerevisiae reference genome, 83 and 60% of the top 100 and top 300 predictions matched the known ARS records, respectively. Based on Ori-Finder 3, we subsequently built a database of the predicted ARSs identified in more than a hundred S. cerevisiae genomes.

Recent years witnessed huge amount of sequencing data, revealing mutations responsible for drug resistance. However, the lack of an up-to-date repository remains a barrier towards utilization of these data and identifying major mutations-associated with resistance. Amongst all mutations, non-synonymous mutations alter the amino acid sequence of a protein and have a much greater effect on pathogenicity. Hence, this type of gene mutation is of prime interest of the present study. The purpose of this study is to develop an updated database comprising almost all reported substitutions within the <i>Mycobacterium tuberculosis</i> (<i>M.tb</i>) drug target genes <i>rpoB</i>, <i>inhA</i>, <i>katG</i>, <i>pncA</i>, <i>gyrA</i> and <i>gyrB.</i> Various bioinformatics prediction tools were used to assess the structural and biophysical impacts of the resistance causing non-synonymous single nucleotide polymorphisms (nsSNPs) at the molecular level. This was followed by evaluating the impact of these mutations on binding affinity of the drugs to target proteins. We have developed a comprehensive online resource named MycoTRAP-DB (<i>Mycobacterium tuberculosis</i> Resistance Associated Polymorphisms Database) that connects mutations in genes with their structural, functional and pathogenic implications on protein. This database is accessible at http://139.59.12.92.

The rapid, recent appearance of comprehensive unbiased gene expression data in the various renal tubule segments, chiefly RNA sequencing and protein mass spectrometry data, has provided a means of identifying patterns of GPCR expression along the renal tubule. To allow for comprehensive mapping, we first curated a comprehensive list of GPCRs in the genomes of mice, rats, and humans (https://hpcwebapps.cit.nih.gov/ESBL/Database/GPCRs/) using multiple online data sources. We used this list to mine segment-specific and cell type-specific expression data from RNA-sequencing studies in microdissected mouse tubule segments to identify GPCRs that are selectively expressed in discrete tubule segments. Comparisons of these mapped mouse GPCRs with other omics datasets as well as functional data from isolated perfused tubule and micropuncture studies confirmed patterns of expression for well-known receptors and identified poorly studied GPCRs that are likely to play roles in the regulation of renal tubule function.

To facilitate efforts to gain insights into SARS-CoV-2 biology and to target the virus therapeutically, it is essential to have a roadmap of likely functional regions embedded in its RNA genome. In this report, we used a bioinformatics approach, ScanFold, to deduce the <i>local</i> RNA structural landscape of the SARS-CoV-2 genome with the highest likelihood of being functional. We recapitulate previously-known elements of RNA structure and provide a model for the folding of an essential frameshift signal. Our results find that SARS-CoV-2 is greatly enriched in unusually stable and likely evolutionarily ordered RNA structure, which provides a large reservoir of potential drug targets for RNA-binding small molecules. Results are enhanced via the re-analyses of publicly-available genome-wide biochemical structure probing datasets that are broadly in agreement with our models. Additionally, ScanFold was updated to incorporate experimental data as constraints in the analysis to facilitate comparisons between ScanFold and other RNA modelling approaches. Ultimately, ScanFold was able to identify eight highly structured/conserved motifs in SARS-CoV-2 that agree with experimental data, without explicitly using these data.

Several exon-skipping ASOs have been approved to treat genetic diseases worldwide. However, a significant challenge is the difficulty in selecting an optimal sequence for exon skipping. The efficacy of ASOs is often unpredictable, because of the numerous factors involved in exon skipping. To address this gap, we have developed a computational method using machine-learning algorithms that factors in many parameters as well as experimental data to design highly effective ASOs for exon skipping. eSkip-Finder (https://eskip-finder.org) is the first web-based resource for helping researchers identify effective exon skipping ASOs. eSkip-Finder features two sections: (i) a predictor of the exon skipping efficacy of novel ASOs and (ii) a database of exon skipping ASOs. The predictor facilitates rapid analysis of a given set of exon/intron sequences and ASO lengths to identify effective ASOs for exon skipping based on a machine learning model trained by experimental data. We confirmed that predictions correlated well with in vitro skipping efficacy of sequences that were not included in the training data.

34107869,PINIR: a comprehensive information resource for Pin-II type protease inhibitors.,"<h4>Background</h4>Serine protease inhibitors belonging to the Potato type-II Inhibitor family Protease Inhibitors (Pin-II type PIs) are essential plant defense molecules. They are characterized by multiple inhibitory repeat domains, conserved disulfide bond pattern, and a tripeptide reactive center loop. These features of Pin-II type PIs make them potential molecules for protein engineering and designing inhibitors for agricultural and therapeutic applications. However, the diversity in these PIs remains unexplored due to the lack of annotated protein sequences and their functional attributes in the available databases.<h4>Results</h4>We have developed a database, PINIR (Pin-II type PIs Information Resource), by systematic collection and manual annotation of 415 Pin-II type PI protein sequences. For each PI, the number and position for signature sequences are specified: 695 domains, 75 linkers, 63 reactive center loops, and 10 disulfide bond patterns are identified and mapped. Database analysis revealed novel subcategories of PIs, species-correlated occurrence of inhibitory domains, reactive center loops, and disulfide bond patterns. By analyzing linker regions, we predict that alternative processing at linker regions could generate PI variants in the Solanaceae family.<h4>Conclusion</h4>PINIR ( https://pinir.ncl.res.in ) provides a web interface for browsing and analyzing the protein sequences of Pin-II type PIs. Information about signature sequences, spatio-temporal expression, biochemical properties, gene sequences, and literature references are provided. Analysis of PINIR depicts conserved species-specific features of Pin-II type PI protein sequences.

They are ubiquitous genetic elements conserved across species and suspected to be involved in numerous cellular processes. MetamORF (https://metamorf.hb.univ-amu.fr/) aims to provide a repository of unique sORFs identified in the human and mouse genomes with both experimental and computational approaches. By gathering publicly available sORF data, normalizing them and summarizing redundant information, we were able to identify a total of 1‚Äâ162‚Äâ675 unique sORFs. Despite the usual characterization of ORFs as short, upstream or downstream, there is currently no clear consensus regarding the definition of these categories. Thus, the data have been reprocessed using a normalized nomenclature. MetamORF enables new analyses at locus, gene, transcript and ORF levels, which should offer the possibility to address new questions regarding sORF functions in the future. The repository is available through an user-friendly web interface, allowing easy browsing, visualization, filtering over multiple criteria and export possibilities. sORFs can be searched starting from a gene, a transcript and an ORF ID, looking in a genome area or browsing the whole repository for a species.

It is critical to locate these TF-DNA interactions to understand transcriptional regulation. Efforts to predict bona fide TFBSs benefit from the availability of experimental data mapping DNA binding regions of TFs (chromatin immunoprecipitation followed by sequencing - ChIP-seq).<h4>Results</h4>In this study, we processed ~‚Äâ10,000 public ChIP-seq datasets from nine species to provide high-quality TFBS predictions. After quality control, it culminated with the prediction of ~‚Äâ56 million TFBSs with experimental and computational support for direct TF-DNA interactions for 644 TFs in >‚Äâ1000 cell lines and tissues. These TFBSs were used to predict >‚Äâ197,000 cis-regulatory modules representing clusters of binding events in the corresponding genomes. The high-quality of the TFBSs was reinforced by their evolutionary conservation, enrichment at active cis-regulatory regions, and capacity to predict combinatorial binding of TFs. Further, we confirmed that the cell type and tissue specificity of enhancer activity was correlated with the number of TFs with binding sites predicted in these regions. All the data is provided to the community through the UniBind database that can be accessed through its web-interface ( https://unibind.uio.no/ ), a dedicated RESTful API, and as genomic tracks.

Currently, studies in rice (Oryza sativa) have mainly focused on the identification of GVs, while the functional annotation of GVs has not yet been systematically carried out. Here we present a functional impact map of GVs in rice. We curated haplotype information of 17,397,026 GVs from sequencing data of 4,726 rice accessions. We quantitatively evaluated the effects of missense mutations in coding regions in each haplotype based on the conservation of amino acid residues and obtained the effects of 918,848 non-redundant missense GVs. We also generated high-quality chromatin accessibility (CA) data from six representative rice tissues and used these data to train deep convolutional neural network models to predict the impacts of 5,067,405 GVs for CA in regulatory regions. We characterized the functional properties and tissue specificity of the effects of GVs and found that large-effect GVs in coding and regulatory regions might be subject to selection in different directions. We finally demonstrated how the functional impact map could be used to prioritize the causal variants in mapping populations. This impact map will be a useful resource for accelerating gene cloning and functional studies in rice and can be freely queried in RiceVarMap V2.0 (http://ricevarmap.ncpgr.cn).",hji,,1,1,1,1.0,,
34225788,A global overview of genetically interpretable multimorbidities among common diseases in the UK Biobank.,"<h4>Background</h4>Multimorbidities greatly increase the global health burdens, but the landscapes of their genetic risks have not been systematically investigated.<h4>Methods</h4>We used the hospital inpatient data of 385,335 patients in the UK Biobank to investigate the multimorbid relations among 439 common diseases. Post-GWAS analyses were performed to identify multimorbidity shared genetic risks at the genomic loci, network, as well as overall genetic architecture levels. We conducted network decomposition for the networks of genetically interpretable multimorbidities to detect the hub diseases and the involved molecules and functions in each module.<h4>Results</h4>In total, 11,285 multimorbidities among 439 common diseases were identified, and 46% of them were genetically interpretable at the loci, network, or overall genetic architecture levels. Multimorbidities affecting the same and different physiological systems displayed different patterns of the shared genetic components, with the former more likely to share loci-level genetic components while the latter more likely to share network-level genetic components. Moreover, both the loci- and network-level genetic components shared by multimorbidities converged on cell immunity, protein metabolism, and gene silencing. Furthermore, we found that the genetically interpretable multimorbidities tend to form network modules, mediated by hub diseases and featuring physiological categories. Finally, we showcased how hub diseases mediating the multimorbidity modules could help provide useful insights for the genetic contributors of multimorbidities.<h4>Conclusions</h4>Our results provide a systematic resource for understanding the genetic predispositions of multimorbidities and indicate that hub diseases and converged molecules and functions may be the key for treating multimorbidities.

34013642,Efficient study design to estimate population means with multiple measurement instruments.,"Outcomes from studies assessing exposure often use multiple measurements. In previous work, using a model first proposed by Buonoccorsi (1991), we showed that combining direct (eg, biomarkers) and indirect (eg, self-report) measurements provides a more accurate picture of true exposure than estimates obtained when using a single type of measurement. In this article, we propose a tool for efficient design of studies that include both direct and indirect measurements of a relevant outcome. Based on data from a pilot or preliminary study, the tool, which is available online as a shiny app at https://michalbitan.shinyapps.io/shinyApp/, can be used to compute: (1) the sample size required for a statistical power analysis, while optimizing the percent of participants who should provide direct measures of exposure (biomarkers) in addition to the indirect (self-report) measures provided by all participants; (2) the ideal number of replicates; and (3) the allocation of resources to intervention and control arms. In addition we show how to examine the sensitivity of results to underlying assumptions. We illustrate our analysis using studies of tobacco smoke exposure and nutrition.

34015821,ProtCHOIR: a tool for proteome-scale generation of homo-oligomers.,"The rapid developments in gene sequencing technologies achieved in the recent decades, along with the expansion of knowledge on the three-dimensional structures of proteins, have enabled the construction of proteome-scale databases of protein models such as the Genome3D and ModBase. Nevertheless, although gene products are usually expressed as individual polypeptide chains, most biological processes are associated with either transient or stable oligomerisation. In the PDB databank, for example, ~40% of the deposited structures contain at least one homo-oligomeric interface. Unfortunately, databases of protein models are generally devoid of multimeric structures. To tackle this particular issue, we have developed ProtCHOIR, a tool that is able to generate homo-oligomeric structures in an automated fashion, providing detailed information for the input protein and output complex. ProtCHOIR requires input of either a sequence or a protomeric structure that is queried against a pre-constructed local database of homo-oligomeric structures, then extensively analyzed using well-established tools such as PSI-Blast, MAFFT, PISA and Molprobity. Finally, MODELLER is employed to achieve the construction of the homo-oligomers. The output complex is thoroughly analyzed taking into account its stereochemical quality, interfacial stabilities, hydrophobicity and conservation profile. All these data are then summarized in a user-friendly HTML report that can be saved or printed as a PDF file. The software is easily parallelizable and also outputs a comma-separated file with summary statistics that can straightforwardly be concatenated as a spreadsheet-like document for large-scale data analyses. As a proof-of-concept, we built oligomeric models for the Mabellini Mycobacterium abscessus structural proteome database.

21255607,"Aromatic-Aromatic Interactions Database, A(2)ID: an analysis of aromatic π-networks in proteins.","The geometrical arrangement of the aromatic rings of phenylalanine, tyrosine, tryptophan and histidine has been analyzed at a database level using the X-ray crystal structure of proteins from PDB in order to find out the aromatic-aromatic (p-p) networks in proteins and to understand how these aromatic rings are connected with each-other in a specific p-p network. A stringent examination of the 7848 proteins indicates that close to 89% of the proteins have occurrence of at least a network of 2p or a higher p-p network. The occurrence of p-p networks in various protein superfamilies based on SCOP, CATH and EC classifiers has also been probed in the present work. In general, we find that multidomain and membrane proteins as well as lyases show a more number of these networks. Analysis of the distribution of angle between planes of two proximal aromatic rings (<U+03D5>) distribution indicates that at a larger cutoff distance (between centroid of two aromatic rings), above 5�, C-H<U+22EF>p interactions (T-shaped orientation) are more prevalent, while p-p interactions (stacked orientation) are more prevalent at a smaller cutoff distance. The connectivity patterns of p-p networks propose strong propensity of finding arrangement of aromatic residues as clusters rather than linear arrangement.

The identification of suitable biomarkers could facilitate early detection and diagnosis and allow better understanding of the underlying pathology. One of the challenges in meeting this goal is the necessary integration of experimental results from multiple biological levels for further analysis by data mining. Data integration in the life science is still a struggle, and many groups are looking to the benefits promised by the Semantic Web for data integration.<h4>Results</h4>We present a Semantic Web approach to developing a knowledge base that integrates data from high-throughput experiments on kidney and urine. A specialised KUP ontology is used to tie the various layers together, whilst background knowledge from external databases is incorporated by conversion into RDF. Using SPARQL as a query mechanism, we are able to query for proteins expressed in urine and place these back into the context of genes expressed in regions of the kidney.<h4>Conclusions</h4>The KUPKB gives KUP biologists the means to ask queries across many resources in order to aggregate knowledge that is necessary for answering biological questions. The Semantic Web technologies we use, together with the background knowledge from the domain's ontologies, allows both rapid conversion and integration of this knowledge base.

While many neuropeptides have been identified in previous studies, the resulting data has not been structured to facilitate further analysis by tandem mass spectrometry (MS/MS), the main technology for high-throughput neuropeptide identification. Many neuropeptides are difficult to identify when searching MS/MS spectra against large protein databases because of their atypical lengths (e.g. shorter/longer than common tryptic peptides) and lack of tryptic residues to facilitate peptide ionization/fragmentation. NeuroPedia is a neuropeptide encyclopedia of peptide sequences (including genomic and taxonomic information) and spectral libraries of identified MS/MS spectra of homolog neuropeptides from multiple species. Searching neuropeptide MS/MS data against known NeuroPedia sequences will improve the sensitivity of database search tools. Moreover, the availability of neuropeptide spectral libraries will also enable the utilization of spectral library search tools, which are known to further improve the sensitivity of peptide identification. These will also reinforce the confidence in peptide identifications by enabling visual comparisons between new and previously identified neuropeptide MS/MS spectra.<h4>Availability</h4>http://proteomics.ucsd.edu/Software/NeuroPedia.html<h4>Contact</h4>bandeira@ucsd.edu<h4>Supplementary information</h4>Supplementary materials are available at Bioinformatics online.","kes, hji",1.0,1,2,2,1.0,,
22058129,DistiLD Database: diseases and traits in linkage disequilibrium blocks.,"Genome-wide association studies (GWAS) have identified thousands of single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) associated with the risk of hundreds of diseases. However, there is currently no database that enables non-specialists to answer the following simple questions: which SNPs associated with diseases are in linkage disequilibrium (LD) with a gene of interest? Which chromosomal regions have been associated with a given disease, and which are the potentially causal genes in each region? To answer these questions, we use data from the HapMap Project to partition each chromosome into so-called LD blocks, so that SNPs in LD with each other are preferentially in the same block, whereas SNPs not in LD are in different blocks. By projecting SNPs and genes onto LD blocks, the DistiLD database aims to increase usage of existing GWAS results by making it easy to query and visualize disease-associated SNPs and genes in their chromosomal context. The database is available at http://distild.jensenlab.org/.","kes, hji",1.0,1,2,2,1.0,,

22276777,miRdSNP: a database of disease-associated SNPs and microRNA target sites on 3'UTRs of human genes.,"<h4>Background</h4>Single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) can lead to the susceptibility and onset of diseases through their effects on gene expression at the posttranscriptional level. Recent findings indicate that SNPs could create, destroy, or modify the efficiency of miRNA binding to the 3'UTR of a gene, resulting in gene dysregulation. With the rapidly growing number of published disease-associated SNPs (dSNPs), there is a strong need for resources specifically recording dSNPs on the 3'UTRs and their nucleotide distance from miRNA target sites. We present here miRdSNP, a database incorporating three important areas of dSNPs, miRNA target sites, and diseases.<h4>Description</h4>miRdSNP provides a unique database of dSNPs on the 3'UTRs of human genes manually curated from PubMed. The current release includes 786 dSNP-disease associations for 630 unique dSNPs and 204 disease types. miRdSNP annotates genes with experimentally confirmed targeting by miRNAs and indexes miRNA target sites predicted by TargetScan and PicTar as well as potential miRNA target sites newly generated by dSNPs. A robust web interface and search tools are provided for studying the proximity of miRNA binding sites to dSNPs in relation to human diseases. Searches can be dynamically filtered by gene name, miRBase ID, target prediction algorithm, disease, and any nucleotide distance between dSNPs and miRNA target sites. Results can be viewed at the sequence level showing the annotated locations for miRNA target sites and dSNPs on the entire 3'UTR sequences. The integration of dSNPs with the UCSC Genome browser is also supported.<h4>Conclusion</h4>miRdSNP provides a comprehensive data source of dSNPs and robust tools for exploring their distance from miRNA target sites on the 3'UTRs of human genes. miRdSNP enables researchers to further explore the molecular mechanism of gene dysregulation for dSNPs at posttranscriptional level. miRdSNP is freely available on the web at http://mirdsnp.ccr.buffalo.edu.","kes, hji",1.0,1,2,2,1.0,,
22334387,The androgen receptor gene mutations database: 2012 update.,"The current version of the androgen receptor gene (AR) mutations database is described. A major change to the database is that the nomenclature and numbering scheme now conforms to all Human Genome Variation Society norms. The total number of reported mutations has risen from 605 to 1,029 since 2004. The database now contains a number of mutations that are associated with prostate cancer (CaP) treatment regimens, while the number of AR mutations found in CaP tissues has more than doubled from 76 to 159. In addition, in a number of androgen insensitivity syndrome (AIS) and CaP cases, multiple mutations have been found within the same tissue samples. For the first time, we report on a disconnect within the AIS phenotype-genotype relationship among our own patient database, in that over 40% of our patients with a classic complete AIS or partial AIS phenotypes did not appear to have a mutation in their AR gene. The implications of this phenomenon on future locus-specific mutation database (LSDB) development are discussed, together with the concept that mutations can be associated with both loss- and gain-of-function, and the effect of multiple AR mutations within individuals.

22345505,ANAP: an integrated knowledge base for Arabidopsis protein interaction network analysis.,"Protein interactions are fundamental to the molecular processes occurring within an organism and can be utilized in network biology to help organize, simplify, and understand biological complexity. Currently, there are more than 10 publicly available Arabidopsis (Arabidopsis thaliana) protein interaction databases. However, there are limitations with these databases, including different types of interaction evidence, a lack of defined standards for protein identifiers, differing levels of information, and, critically, a lack of integration between them. In this paper, we present an interactive bioinformatics Web tool, ANAP (Arabidopsis Network Analysis Pipeline), which serves to effectively integrate the different data sets and maximize access to available data. ANAP has been developed for Arabidopsis protein interaction integration and network-based study to facilitate functional protein network analysis. ANAP integrates 11 Arabidopsis protein interaction databases, comprising 201,699 unique protein interaction pairs, 15,208 identifiers (including 11,931 The Arabidopsis Information Resource Arabidopsis Genome Initiative codes), 89 interaction detection methods, 73 species that interact with Arabidopsis, and 6,161 references. ANAP can be used as a knowledge base for constructing protein interaction networks based on user input and supports both direct and indirect interaction analysis. It has an intuitive graphical interface allowing easy network visualization and provides extensive detailed evidence for each interaction. In addition, ANAP displays the gene and protein annotation in the generated interactive network with links to The Arabidopsis Information Resource, the AtGenExpress Visualization Tool, the Arabidopsis 1,001 Genomes GBrowse, the Protein Knowledgebase, the Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes, and the Ensembl Genome Browser to significantly aid functional network analysis.

Most of these proteins are generated as a response to the stimulation of toxins or medicines. They are essential for the clearance of harmful substances and for maintenance of physiological balance in organisms. Thus, it is important to collect and integrate information on detoxification proteins.<h4>Results</h4>To store, retrieve and analyze the information related to their features and functions, we developed the DetoxiProt, a comprehensive database for annotation of these proteins. This database provides detailed introductions about different classes of the detoxification proteins. Extensive annotations of these proteins, including sequences, structures, features, inducers, inhibitors, substrates, chromosomal location, functional domains as well as physiological-biochemical properties were generated. Furthermore, pre-computed BLAST results, multiple sequence alignments and evolutionary trees for detoxification proteins are also provided for evolutionary study of conserved function and pathways. The current version of DetoxiProt contains 5956 protein entries distributed in 628 organisms. An easy to use web interface was designed, so that annotations about each detoxification protein can be retrieved by browsing with a specific method or by searching with different criteria.<h4>Conclusions</h4>DetoxiProt provides an effective and efficient way of accessing the detoxification protein sequences and other high-quality information. This database would be a valuable source for toxicologists, pharmacologists and medicinal chemists.

This resource will provide information to researchers studying the molecular and genetic causes of stroke in terms of genomic variants, genes, and pathways.<h4>Methods</h4>Reported genetic variants, gene structure, phenotypes, and literature information regarding stroke were collected and extracted from publicly available databases describing variants, genome, proteome, functional annotation, and disease subtypes. Stroke related candidate pathways and etiologic genes that participate significantly in risk were analyzed in terms of canonical pathways in public biological pathway databases. These efforts resulted in a relational database of genetic signals of cerebral stroke, SigCS base, which implements an effective web retrieval system.<h4>Results</h4>The current version of SigCS base documents 1943 non-redundant genes with 11472 genetic variants and 165 non-redundant pathways. The web retrieval system of SigCS base consists of two principal search flows, including: 1) a gene-based variant search using gene table browsing or a keyword search, and, 2) a pathway-based variant search using pathway table browsing. SigCS base is freely accessible at http://sysbio.kribb.re.kr/sigcs.<h4>Conclusions</h4>SigCS base is an effective tool that can assist researchers in the identification of the genetic factors associated with stroke by utilizing existing literature information, selecting candidate genes and variants for experimental studies, and examining the pathways that contribute to the pathophysiological mechanisms of stroke.","kes, hji",1.0,1,2,2,1.0,,

Chromosome replication begins at specific sites, called origins of replication (oriCs), for all three domains of life. However, the origins of replication still remain unknown in a considerably large number of bacterial and archaeal genomes completely sequenced so far. The availability of increasing complete bacterial and archaeal genomes has created challenges and opportunities for identification of their oriCs in silico, as well as in vivo. Based on the Z-curve theory, we have developed a web-based system Ori-Finder to predict oriCs in bacterial genomes with high accuracy and reliability by taking advantage of comparative genomics, and the predicted oriC regions have been organized into an online database DoriC, which is publicly available at http://tubic.tju.edu.cn/doric/ since 2007. Five years after we constructed DoriC, the database has significant advances over the number of bacterial genomes, increasing about 4-fold. Additionally, oriC regions in archaeal genomes identified by in vivo experiments, as well as in silico analyses, have also been added to the database.

The angiosperms (flowering plants) are outstanding models in which to elucidate consequences of GD for higher eukaryotes, owing to their propensity for chromosomal duplication or even triplication in a few cases. Duplicated genome structures often require both intra- and inter-genome alignments to unravel their evolutionary history, also providing the means to deduce both obvious and otherwise-cryptic orthology, paralogy and other relationships among genes. The burgeoning sets of angiosperm genome sequences provide the foundation for a host of investigations into the functional and evolutionary consequences of gene and GD. To provide genome alignments from a single resource based on uniform standards that have been validated by empirical studies, we built the Plant Genome Duplication Database (PGDD; freely available at http://chibba.agtec.uga.edu/duplication/), a web service providing synteny information in terms of colinearity between chromosomes.

Currently, there are 837, 835 and 821 candidate genes recorded in T-HOD for hypertension, obesity and diabetes, respectively. T-HOD employed the state-of-art text-mining technologies, including a gene/disease identification system and a disease-gene relation extraction system, which can be used to affirm the association of genes with three diseases and provide more evidence for further studies. The primary inputs of T-HOD are the three kinds of diseases, and the output is a list of disease-related genes that can be ranked based on their number of appearance, protein-protein interactions and single-nucleotide polymorphisms. Unlike manually constructed disease gene databases, the content of T-HOD is regularly updated by our text-mining system and verified by domain experts.

In proteomics, several studies aim to use protein sequence repositories to annotate MS experiments or to detect differentially expressed proteins. However, the available protein sequence repositories are not designed to fully detect protein isoforms derived from mRNA splice variants. To foster knowledge for the field, here we introduce SpliceProt, a new protein sequence repository of transcriptome experimental data used to investigate for putative splice variants in human proteomes. Current version of SpliceProt contains 159�719 non-redundant putative polypeptide sequences. The assessment of the potential of SpliceProt in detecting new protein isoforms resulting from alternative splicing was performed by using publicly available proteomics data. We detected 173 peptides hypothetically derived from splice variants, which 54 of them are not present in UniprotKB/TrEMBL sequence repository. In comparison to other protein sequence repositories, SpliceProt contains a greater number of unique peptides and is able to detect more splice variants. Therefore, SpliceProt provides a solution for the annotation of proteomics experiments regarding splice isofoms.

Increasing the relative oil concentration in soybean seeds is many researchers' goal, but a complete analysis platform of functional annotation for the genes involved in the soybean acyl-lipid pathway is still lacking. Following the success of soybean whole-genome sequencing, functional annotation has become a major challenge for the scientific community. Whole-genome transcriptome analysis is a powerful way to predict genes with biological functions. It is essential to build a comprehensive analysis platform for integrating soybean whole-genome sequencing data, the available transcriptome data and protein information. This platform could also be used to identify acyl-lipid metabolism pathways.<h4>Description</h4>In this study, we describe our construction of the Soybean Functional Genomics Database (SFGD) using Generic Genome Browser (Gbrowse) as the core platform. We integrated microarray expression profiling with 255 samples from 14 groups' experiments and mRNA-seq data with 30 samples from four groups' experiments, including spatial and temporal transcriptome data for different soybean development stages and environmental stresses. The SFGD includes a gene co-expression regulatory network containing 23,267 genes and 1873 miRNA-target pairs, and a group of acyl-lipid pathways containing 221 enzymes and more than 1550 genes. The SFGD also provides some key analysis tools, i.e. BLAST search, expression pattern search and cis-element significance analysis, as well as gene ontology information search and single nucleotide polymorphism display.<h4>Conclusion</h4>The SFGD is a comprehensive database integrating genome and transcriptome data, and also for soybean acyl-lipid metabolism pathways. It provides useful toolboxes for biologists to improve the accuracy and robustness of soybean functional genomics analysis, further improving understanding of gene regulatory networks for effective crop improvement.

The functional structure of a community can be represented by a set of functional traits assigned to behavioural, reproductive and morphological characteristics. The collection of these traits from the literature is however a laborious and time-consuming process, and gaps of knowledge and restricted availability of literature are a common problem. Trait data are not yet readily being shared by research communities, and even if they are, a lack of trait data repositories and standards for data formats leads to the publication of trait information in forms which cannot be processed by computers. This paper describes Polytraits (http://polytraits.lifewatchgreece.eu), a database on biological traits of marine polychaetes (bristle worms, Polychaeta: Annelida). At present, the database contains almost 20,000 records on morphological, behavioural and reproductive characteristics of more than 1,000 marine polychaete species, all referenced by literature sources.

Several lines of evidence suggest that epigenetic- or genetic-mediated dysfunction is frequently present in these disorders. To date, the inheritance patterns have been complicated by the problem of integrating epigenomic and transcriptomic factors that have yet to be elucidated. Therefore, there is a need to build a comprehensive database for storing epigenomic and transcriptomic data relating to psychiatric disorders.<h4>Description</h4>We have developed the PD_NGSAtlas, which focuses on the efficient storage of epigenomic and transcriptomic data based on next-generation sequencing and on the quantitative analyses of epigenetic and transcriptional alterations involved in psychiatric disorders. The current release of the PD_NGSAtlas contains 43 DNA methylation profiles and 37 transcription profiles detected by MeDIP-Seq and RNA-Seq, respectively, in two distinct brain regions and peripheral blood of SZ, BP and non-psychiatric controls. In addition to these data that were generated in-house, we have included, and will continue to include, published DNA methylation and gene expression data from other research groups, with a focus on psychiatric disorders. A flexible query engine has been developed for the acquisition of methylation profiles and transcription profiles for special genes or genomic regions of interest of the selected samples. Furthermore, the PD_NGSAtlas offers online tools for identifying aberrantly methylated and expressed events involved in psychiatric disorders. A genome browser has been developed to provide integrative and detailed views of multidimensional data in a given genomic context, which can help researchers understand molecular mechanisms from epigenetic and transcriptional perspectives. Moreover, users can download the methylation and transcription data for further analyses.<h4>Conclusions</h4>The PD_NGSAtlas aims to provide storage of epigenomic and transcriptomic data as well as quantitative analyses of epigenetic and transcriptional alterations involved in psychiatric disorders.

Translating fossil data into minimum and maximum bounds for calibrations is the most important-often least appreciated-step of divergence dating. Properly justified calibrations require the synthesis of phylogenetic, paleontological, and geological evidence and can be difficult for nonspecialists to formulate.

26387108,The Protein Ensemble Database.,"The scientific community's major conceptual notion of structural biology has recently shifted in emphasis from the classical structure-function paradigm due to the emergence of intrinsically disordered proteins (IDPs). As opposed to their folded cousins, these proteins are defined by the lack of a stable 3D fold and a high degree of inherent structural heterogeneity that is closely tied to their function. Due to their flexible nature, solution techniques such as small-angle X-ray scattering (SAXS), nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy and fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET) are particularly well-suited for characterizing their biophysical properties. Computationally derived structural ensembles based on such experimental measurements provide models of the conformational sampling displayed by these proteins, and they may offer valuable insights into the functional consequences of inherent flexibility. The Protein Ensemble Database (http://pedb.vib.be) is the first openly accessible, manually curated online resource storing the ensemble models, protocols used during the calculation procedure, and underlying primary experimental data derived from SAXS and/or NMR measurements. By making this previously inaccessible data freely available to researchers, this novel resource is expected to promote the development of more advanced modelling methodologies, facilitate the design of standardized calculation protocols, and consequently lead to a better understanding of how function arises from the disordered state.","kes, hji",1.0,1,2,2,1.0,,

A substantial fraction of piRNAs originates from genomic loci termed piRNA clusters and sequences encoded in these piRNA clusters determine putative targets for the Piwi/piRNA system. In the past decade, studies of piRNA transcriptomes in different species revealed additional roles for piRNAs beyond transposon silencing, reflecting the astonishing plasticity of the Piwi/piRNA system along different phylogenetic branches. Moreover, piRNA transcriptomes can change drastically during development and vary across different tissues.Since piRNA clusters crucially shape piRNA profiles, analysis of these loci is imperative for a thorough understanding of functional and evolutionary aspects of the piRNA pathway. But despite the ever-growing amount of available piRNA sequence data, we know little about the factors that determine differential regulation of piRNA clusters, nor the evolutionary events that cause their gain or loss.In order to facilitate addressing these subjects, we established a user-friendly piRNA cluster database (http://www.smallrnagroup-mainz.de/piRNAclusterDB.html) that provides comprehensive data on piRNA clusters in multiple species, tissues and developmental stages based on small RNA sequence data deposited at NCBI's Sequence Read Archive (SRA).","kes, hji",1.0,1,2,2,1.0,,

The associated biological pathway information was also specially marked for the interactions that are involved in the pathway to facilitate the investigation of cross-talk between pathways. Furthermore, HRGRN integrates a series of graph path search algorithms to discover novel relationships among genes, compounds, RNAs and even pathways from heterogeneous biological interaction data that could be missed by traditional SQL database search methods. Users can also build subnetworks based on known interactions. The outcomes are visualized with rich text, figures and interactive network graphs on web pages. The HRGRN database is freely available at http://plantgrn.noble.org/hrgrn/.","kes, hji",1.0,1,2,2,1.0,,
26777304,dbEM: A database of epigenetic modifiers curated from cancerous and normal genomes.,"We have developed a database called dbEM (database of Epigenetic Modifiers) to maintain the genomic information of about 167 epigenetic modifiers/proteins, which are considered as potential cancer targets. In dbEM, modifiers are classified on functional basis and comprise of 48 histone methyl transferases, 33 chromatin remodelers and 31 histone demethylases. dbEM maintains the genomic information like mutations, copy number variation and gene expression in thousands of tumor samples, cancer cell lines and healthy samples. This information is obtained from public resources viz. COSMIC, CCLE and 1000-genome project. Gene essentiality data retrieved from COLT database further highlights the importance of various epigenetic proteins for cancer survival. We have also reported the sequence profiles, tertiary structures and post-translational modifications of these epigenetic proteins in cancer. It also contains information of 54 drug molecules against different epigenetic proteins. A wide range of tools have been integrated in dbEM e.g. Search, BLAST, Alignment and Profile based prediction. In our analysis, we found that epigenetic proteins DNMT3A, HDAC2, KDM6A, and TET2 are highly mutated in variety of cancers. We are confident that dbEM will be very useful in cancer research particularly in the field of epigenetic proteins based cancer therapeutics.

27199454,Comprehensive database of human E3 ubiquitin ligases: application to aquaporin-2 regulation.,"Aquaporin-2 (AQP2) is regulated in part via vasopressin-mediated changes in protein half-life that are in turn dependent on AQP2 ubiquitination. Here we addressed the question, """"What E3 ubiquitin ligase is most likely to be responsible for AQP2 ubiquitination?"""" using large-scale data integration based on Bayes' rule. The first step was to bioinformatically identify all E3 ligase genes coded by the human genome. The 377 E3 ubiquitin ligases identified in the human genome, consisting predominant of HECT, RING, and U-box proteins, have been used to create a publically accessible and downloadable online database (https://hpcwebapps.cit.nih.gov/ESBL/Database/E3-ligases/). We also curated a second database of E3 ligase accessory proteins that included BTB domain proteins, cullins, SOCS-box proteins, and F-box proteins. Using Bayes' theorem to integrate information from multiple large-scale proteomic and transcriptomic datasets, we ranked these 377 E3 ligases with respect to their probability of interaction with AQP2. Application of Bayes' rule identified the E3 ligases most likely to interact with AQP2 as (in order of probability): NEDD4 and NEDD4L (tied for first), AMFR, STUB1, ITCH, ZFPL1. Significantly, the two E3 ligases tied for top rank have also been studied extensively in the reductionist literature as regulatory proteins in renal tubule epithelia. The concordance of conclusions from reductionist and systems-level data provides strong motivation for further studies of the roles of NEDD4 and NEDD4L in the regulation of AQP2 protein turnover.","kes, hji",1.0,1,2,2,1.0,,
27451428,SZDB: A Database for Schizophrenia Genetic Research.,"Schizophrenia (SZ) is a debilitating brain disorder with a complex genetic architecture. Genetic studies, especially recent genome-wide association studies (GWAS), have identified multiple variants (loci) conferring risk to SZ. However, how to efficiently extract meaningful biological information from bulk genetic findings of SZ remains a major challenge. There is a pressing need to integrate multiple layers of data from various sources, eg, genetic findings from GWAS, copy number variations (CNVs), association and linkage studies, gene expression, protein-protein interaction (PPI), co-expression, expression quantitative trait loci (eQTL), and Encyclopedia of DNA Elements (ENCODE) data, to provide a comprehensive resource to facilitate the translation of genetic findings into SZ molecular diagnosis and mechanism study. Here we developed the SZDB database (http://www.szdb.org/), a comprehensive resource for SZ research. SZ genetic data, gene expression data, network-based data, brain eQTL data, and SNP function annotation information were systematically extracted, curated and deposited in SZDB. In-depth analyses and systematic integration were performed to identify top prioritized SZ genes and enriched pathways. Multiple types of data from various layers of SZ research were systematically integrated and deposited in SZDB. In-depth data analyses and integration identified top prioritized SZ genes and enriched pathways. We further showed that genes implicated in SZ are highly co-expressed in human brain and proteins encoded by the prioritized SZ risk genes are significantly interacted. The user-friendly SZDB provides high-confidence candidate variants and genes for further functional characterization. More important, SZDB provides convenient online tools for data search and browse, data integration, and customized data analyses.","kes, hji",1.0,1,2,2,1.0,tentative 1; Clinical type data.

27484196,iLIR database: A web resource for LIR motif-containing proteins in eukaryotes.,"Atg8-family proteins are the best-studied proteins of the core autophagic machinery. They are essential for the elongation and closure of the phagophore into a proper autophagosome. Moreover, Atg8-family proteins are associated with the phagophore from the initiation of the autophagic process to, or just prior to, the fusion between autophagosomes with lysosomes. In addition to their implication in autophagosome biogenesis, they are crucial for selective autophagy through their ability to interact with selective autophagy receptor proteins necessary for the specific targeting of substrates for autophagic degradation. In the past few years it has been revealed that Atg8-interacting proteins include not only receptors but also components of the core autophagic machinery, proteins associated with vesicles and their transport, and specific proteins that are selectively degraded by autophagy. Atg8-interacting proteins contain a short linear LC3-interacting region/LC3 recognition sequence/Atg8-interacting motif (LIR/LRS/AIM) motif which is responsible for their interaction with Atg8-family proteins. These proteins are referred to as LIR-containing proteins (LIRCPs). So far, many experimental efforts have been carried out to identify new LIRCPs, leading to the characterization of some of them in the past 10�years. Given the need for the identification of LIRCPs in various organisms, we developed the iLIR database ( https://ilir.warwick.ac.uk ) as a freely available web resource, listing all the putative canonical LIRCPs identified in silico in the proteomes of 8 model organisms using the iLIR server, combined with a Gene Ontology (GO) term analysis. Additionally, a curated text-mining analysis of the literature permitted us to identify novel putative LICRPs in mammals that have not previously been associated with autophagy.","kes, hji",1.0,1,2,2,1.0,,value add and available
27841751,A public database of macromolecular diffraction experiments.,"The low reproducibility of published experimental results in many scientific disciplines has recently garnered negative attention in scientific journals and the general media. Public transparency, including the availability of `raw' experimental data, will help to address growing concerns regarding scientific integrity. Macromolecular X-ray crystallography has led the way in requiring the public dissemination of atomic coordinates and a wealth of experimental data, making the field one of the most reproducible in the biological sciences. However, there remains no mandate for public disclosure of the original diffraction data. The Integrated Resource for Reproducibility in Macromolecular Crystallography (IRRMC) has been developed to archive raw data from diffraction experiments and, equally importantly, to provide related metadata. Currently, the database of our resource contains data from 2920 macromolecular diffraction experiments (5767 data sets), accounting for around 3% of all depositions in the Protein Data Bank (PDB), with their corresponding partially curated metadata. IRRMC utilizes distributed storage implemented using a federated architecture of many independent storage servers, which provides both scalability and sustainability. The resource, which is accessible via the web portal at http://www.proteindiffraction.org, can be searched using various criteria. All data are available for unrestricted access and download. The resource serves as a proof of concept and demonstrates the feasibility of archiving raw diffraction data and associated metadata from X-ray crystallographic studies of biological macromolecules. The goal is to expand this resource and include data sets that failed to yield X-ray structures in order to facilitate collaborative efforts that will improve protein structure-determination methods and to ensure the availability of `orphan' data left behind for various reasons by individual investigators and/or extinct structural genomics projects.","kes, hji",1.0,1,2,2,1.0,,

In the updated YM500v3 database (http://ngs.ym.edu.tw/ym500/) presented herein, we not only focus on miRNAs but also on other functional small non-coding RNAs (sncRNAs), such as PIWI-interacting RNAs (piRNAs), tRNA-derived fragments (tRFs), small nuclear RNAs (snRNAs) and small nucleolar RNAs (snoRNAs). There is growing knowledge of the role of sncRNAs in gene regulation and tumorigenesis. We have also incorporated >10 000 cancer-related RNA-seq and >3000 more smRNA-seq data sets into the YM500v3 database. Furthermore, there are two main new sections, 'Survival' and 'Cancer', in this updated version. The 'Survival' section provides the survival analysis results in all cancer types or in a user-defined group of samples for a specific sncRNA. The 'Cancer' section provides the results of differential expression analyses, miRNA-gene interactions and cancer miRNA-related pathways. In the 'Expression' section, sncRNA expression profiles across cancer and sample types are newly provided.

Grouping and prioritizing a large number of genes for further analysis can be a time-consuming challenge. In 2009 we developed a web-based user interface, GExplore, to assist with large-scale data-mining related to gene function in <i>Caenorhabditis elegans</i>. The underlying database contained information about <i>Caenorhabditis elegans</i> genes and proteins including domain organization of the proteins, phenotypic descriptions, expression data and Gene Ontology Consortium annotations. These data enable users to quickly obtain an overview of biological and biochemical functions of a large number of genes at once. Since its inception the underlying database has been updated and expanded significantly. Here we describe the current version of GExplore 1.4, documenting the changes since the original release. GExplore 1.4 now contains information about the domain organization of the proteomes of 9 nematode species, can display the location of <i>Caenorhabditis elegans</i> mutations with respect to the domain organization of the proteins, and includes stage-specific RNAseq gene expression data generated by the modENCODE project. The underlying database has been reorganized to facilitate independent updates of the different parts of the database and to allow the addition of novel data sets in the future.

28149703,Expanding our understanding of the trade in marine aquarium animals.,"The trade of live marine animals for home and public aquaria has grown into a major global industry. Millions of marine fishes and invertebrates are removed from coral reefs and associated habitats each year. The majority are imported into the United States, with the remainder sent to Europe, Japan, and a handful of other countries. Despite the recent growth and diversification of the aquarium trade, to date, data collection is not mandatory, and hence comprehensive information on species volume and diversity is lacking. This lack of information makes it impossible to study trade pathways. Without species-specific volume and diversity data, it is unclear how importing and exporting governments can oversee this industry effectively or how sustainability should be encouraged. To expand our knowledge and understanding of the trade, and to effectively communicate this new understanding, we introduce the publically-available Marine Aquarium Biodiversity and Trade Flow online database (https://www.aquariumtradedata.org/). This tool was created to communicate the volume and diversity of marine fishes and/or invertebrates imported into the US over three complete years (2008, 2009, and 2011) and three partial years (2000, 2004, 2005). To create this tool, invoices pertaining to shipments of live marine fishes and invertebrates were scanned and analyzed for species name, species quantities, country of origin, port of entry, and city of import destination. Here we focus on the analysis of the later three years of data and also produce an estimate for the entirety of 2000, 2004, and 2005. The three-year aggregate totals (2008, 2009, 2011) indicate that just under 2,300 fish and 725 invertebrate species were imported into the US cumulatively, although just under 1,800 fish and 550 invertebrate species were traded annually. Overall, the total number of live marine animals decreased between 2008 and 2011. In 2008, 2009, and 2011, the total number of individual fish (8.2, 7.3, and 6.9 million individuals) and invertebrates (4.2, 3.7, and 3.6 million individuals) assessed by analyzing the invoice data are roughly 60% of the total volumes recorded through the Law Enforcement Management Information System (LEMIS) dataset. Using these complete years, we back-calculated the number of individuals of both fishes and invertebrates imported in 2000, 2004, and 2005. These estimates (9.3, 10.8, and 11.2 million individual fish per year) were consistent with the three years of complete data. We also use these data to understand the global trade in two species (Banggai cardinalfish, <i>Pterapogon kauderni</i>, and orange clownfish, <i>Amphiprion ocellaris</i> / <i>percula</i>) recently considered for Endangered Species Act listing. Aquariumtradedata.org can help create more effective management plans for the traded species, and ideally could be implemented at key trade ports to better assess the global trade of aquatic wildlife.","kes, hji",1.0,1,2,2,1.0,,

Deep-sequencing technology has been widely adopted in miRNA investigations. However, it is still a big mysterious why nearly all sequencing data contain miRNA sequences from exogenous species, called exo-miRNAs. In this study, we developed a novel platform, exo-miRExplorer, for mining and identifying exo-miRNAs from high-throughput small RNA sequencing experiments which originated from tissues and cell lines of multiple organisms. Thousands of exo-miRNAs are characterized with their expression abundance, the RNA families, original organisms and the sequencing platforms presented in exo-miRExplorer. Subsequently, we used exo-miRExplorer to perform further analysis. Comparative analysis of the exo-miRNAs between different sequencing datasets revealed significant correlation of exo-miRNAs between experiments in the same study. The plant-derived exo-miRNAs analysis provided robust evidence for non-diet source of exo-miRNAs. Virus-derived exo-miRNA analysis showed that pathogen RNAs could transfer to host cells and exist in deep-sequencing result at abundance level. In conclusion, exo-miRExplorer provides users with an integrative resource to facilitate detection and analysis of exo-miRNAs. exo-miRExplorer is available at the following URL: http://rna.sysu.edu.cn/exomiRDB/.","kes, hji",1.0,1,2,2,1.0,,

29209336,DRDB: An Online Date Palm Genomic Resource Database.,"Background: Date palm (Phoenix dactylifera L.) is a cultivated woody plant with agricultural and economic importance in many countries around the world. With the advantages of next generation sequencing technologies, genome sequences for many date palm cultivars have been released recently. Short sequence repeat (SSR) and single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) can be identified from these genomic data, and have been proven to be very useful biomarkers in plant genome analysis and breeding. Results: Here, we first improved the date palm genome assembly using 130X of HiSeq data generated in our lab. Then 246,445 SSRs (214,901 SSRs and 31,544 compound SSRs) were annotated in this genome assembly; among the SSRs, mononucleotide SSRs (58.92%) were the most abundant, followed by di- (29.92%), tri- (8.14%), tetra- (2.47%), penta- (0.36%), and hexa-nucleotide SSRs (0.19%). The high-quality PCR primer pairs were designed for most (174,497; 70.81% out of total) SSRs. We also annotated 6,375,806 SNPs with raw read depth=3 in 90% cultivars. To further reduce false positive SNPs, we only kept 5,572,650 (87.40% out of total) SNPs with at least 20% cultivars support for downstream analyses. The high-quality PCR primer pairs were also obtained for 4,177,778 (65.53%) SNPs. We reconstructed the phylogenetic relationships among the 62 cultivars using these variants and found that they can be divided into three clusters, namely North Africa, Egypt - Sudan, and Middle East - South Asian, with Egypt - Sudan being the admixture of North Africa and Middle East - South Asian cultivars; we further confirmed these clusters using principal component analysis. Moreover, 34,346 SSRs and 4,177,778 SNPs with PCR primers were assigned to shared cultivars for cultivar classification and diversity analysis. All these SSRs, SNPs and their classification are available in our database, and can be used for cultivar identification, comparison, and molecular breeding. Conclusion:DRDB is a comprehensive genomic resource database of date palm. It can serve as a bioinformatics platform for date palm genomics, genetics, and molecular breeding.

29315358,HTT-DB: new features and updates.,"Horizontal Transfer (HT) of genetic material between species is a common phenomenon among Bacteria and Archaea species and several databases are available for information retrieval and data mining. However, little attention has been given to this phenomenon among eukaryotic species mainly due to the lower proportion of these events. In the last years, a vertiginous amount of new HT events involving eukaryotic species was reported in the literature, highlighting the need of a common repository to keep the scientific community up to date and describe overall trends. Recently, we published the first HT database focused on HT of transposable elements among eukaryotes: the Horizontal Transposon Transfer DataBase (http://lpa.saogabriel.unipampa.edu.br: 8080/httdatabase/). Here, we present new features and updates of this unique database: (i) its expansion to include virus-host exchange of genetic material, which we called Horizontal Virus Transfer (HVT) and (ii) the availability of a web server for HT detection, where we implemented the online version of vertical and horizontal inheritance consistence analysis (VHICA), an R package developed for HT detection. These improvements will help researchers to navigate through known HVT cases, take data-informed decision and export figures based on keywords searches. Moreover, the availability of the VHICA as an online tool will make this software easily reachable even for researchers with no or little computation knowledge as well as foster our capability to detect new HT events in a wide variety of taxa.

29617941,A reference peptide database for proteome quantification based on experimental mass spectrum response curves.,"<h4>Motivation</h4>Mass spectrometry (MS) based quantification of proteins/peptides has become a powerful tool in biological research with high sensitivity and throughput. The accuracy of quantification, however, has been problematic as not all peptides are suitable for quantification. Several methods and tools have been developed to identify peptides that response well in mass spectrometry and they are mainly based on predictive models, and rarely consider the linearity of the response curve, limiting the accuracy and applicability of the methods. An alternative solution is to select empirically superior peptides that offer satisfactory MS response intensity and linearity in a wide dynamic range of peptide concentration.<h4>Results</h4>We constructed a reference database for proteome quantification based on experimental mass spectrum response curves. The intensity and dynamic range of over 2 647 773 transitions from 121 318 peptides were obtained from a set of dilution experiments, covering 11 040 gene products. These transitions and peptides were evaluated and presented in a database named SCRIPT-MAP. We showed that the best-responder (BR) peptide approach for quantification based on SCRIPT-MAP database is robust, repeatable and accurate in proteome-scale protein quantification. This study provides a reference database as well as a peptides/transitions selection method for quantitative proteomics.<h4>Availability and implementation</h4>SCRIPT-MAP database is available at http://www.firmiana.org/responders/.<h4>Supplementary information</h4>Supplementary data are available at Bioinformatics online.","kes, hji",1.0,1,2,2,1.0,,
29662024,"PKIDB: A Curated, Annotated and Updated Database of Protein Kinase Inhibitors in Clinical Trials.","The number of protein kinase inhibitors (PKIs) approved worldwide continues to grow steadily, with 39 drugs approved in the period between 2001 and January 2018. PKIs on the market have been the subject of many reviews, and structure-property relationships specific to this class of drugs have been inferred. However, the large number of PKIs under development is often overlooked. In this paper, we present PKIDB (Protein Kinase Inhibitor Database), a monthly-updated database gathering approved PKIs as well as PKIs currently in clinical trials. The database compiles currently 180 inhibitors ranging from phase 0 to 4 clinical trials along with annotations extracted from seven public resources. The distribution and property ranges of standard physicochemical properties are presented. They can be used as filters to better prioritize compound selection for future screening campaigns. Interestingly, more than one-third of the kinase inhibitors violate at least one Lipinski's rule. A Principal Component Analysis (PCA) reveals that Type-II inhibitors are mapped to a distinct chemical space as compared to orally administrated drugs as well as to other types of kinase inhibitors. Using a Principal Moment of Inertia (PMI) analysis, we show that PKIs under development tend to explore new shape territories as compared to approved PKIs. In order to facilitate the analysis of the protein space, the kinome tree has been annotated with all protein kinases being targeted by PKIs. Finally, we analyzed the pipeline of the pharmaceutical companies having PKIs on the market or still under development. We hope that this work will assist researchers in the kinase field in identifying and designing the next generation of kinase inhibitors for still untargeted kinases.

29743053,PDXliver: a database of liver cancer patient derived xenograft mouse models.,"<h4>Background</h4>Liver cancer is the second leading cause of cancer-related deaths and characterized by heterogeneity and drug resistance. Patient-derived xenograft (PDX) models have been widely used in cancer research because they reproduce the characteristics of original tumors. However, the current studies of liver cancer PDX mice are scattered and the number of available PDX models are too small to represent the heterogeneity of liver cancer patients. To improve this situation and to complement available PDX models related resources, here we constructed a comprehensive database, PDXliver, to integrate and analyze liver cancer PDX models.<h4>Description</h4>Currently, PDXliver contains 116 PDX models from Chinese liver cancer patients, 51 of them were established by the in-house PDX platform and others were curated from the public literatures. These models are annotated with complete information, including clinical characteristics of patients, genome-wide expression profiles, germline variations, somatic mutations and copy number alterations. Analysis of expression subtypes and mutated genes show that PDXliver represents the diversity of human patients. Another feature of PDXliver is storing drug response data of PDX mice, which makes it possible to explore the association between molecular profiles and drug sensitivity. All data can be accessed via the Browse and Search pages. Additionally, two tools are provided to interactively visualize the omics data of selected PDXs or to compare two groups�of PDXs.<h4>Conclusion</h4>As far as we known, PDXliver is the first public database of liver cancer PDX models. We hope that this comprehensive resource will accelerate the utility of PDX models and facilitate liver cancer research.

The development of differentially diagnostic biomarkers for different subtypes largely depends on understanding the biological pathways and regulatory mechanisms associated with leukemia-implicated genes. Unfortunately, the leukemia-implicated genes that have been identified thus far are scattered among thousands of published studies, and no systematic summary of the differences between adult and childhood leukemia exists with regard to the causative genetic mutations and genetic mechanisms of the various subtypes. In this study, we performed a systematic literature review of those susceptibility genes reported in small-scale experiments and built an online gene database containing a total of 1805 leukemia-associated genes, available at http://soft.bioinfo-minzhao.org/lgl/. Our comparison of genes from the four primary subtypes and between adult and childhood cases identified a number of potential genes related to patient survival.

The essential oil is a mixture of highly complex, naturally occurring volatile aroma compounds synthesized by medicinal and aromatic plants as secondary metabolites. Essential oils widely used in pharmaceutical, cosmetic, sanitary, food industry and agriculture for their antibacterial, antiviral, antifungal, antiparasitic, insecticidal, anticancer, neuroprotective, psychophysiological, and anti-aging activities. Moreover, volatile aroma compounds comprise a chemically diverse class of low molecular weight organic compounds with significant vapor pressure. However, aroma compounds produced by plants, mainly attract pollinators, seed dispersers and provide defense against pests or pathogens. However, in humans, about 300 active olfactory receptor genes are involved to detect thousands of different aroma compounds and modulates expression of different metabolic genes regulating human psychophysiological activity, brain function, pharmacological signaling, and therapeutic potential. Keeping in mind this importance, present database, namely, AromaDb (http://bioinfo.cimap.res.in/aromadb/) covers information of plant varieties/chemotypes, essential oils, chemical constituents, GC-MS profile, yield variations due to agro-morphological parameters, trade data, aroma compounds, fragrance type, and bioactivity details. The database includes 1,321 aroma chemical structures, bioactivities of essential oil/aroma compounds, 357 fragrance type, 166 commercially used plants, and their high yielding 148 varieties/chemotypes. Also includes calculated cheminformatics properties related to identification, physico-chemical properties, pharmacokinetics, toxicological, and ecological information. Also comprises interacted human genes affecting various diseases related cell signaling pathways correlating the use of aromatherapy.

From these, relatively few amyloid structures can be identified, since amyloids are insoluble in water. Therefore, most amyloid structures deposited in the PDB are in the form of solid state NMR data. Based on the geometric analysis of these deposited structures, we have prepared an automatically updated web server, which generates a list of the deposited amyloid structures, and also entries of globular proteins that have amyloid-like substructures of given size and characteristics. We have found that by applying only appropriately selected geometric conditions, it is possible to identify deposited amyloid structures and a number of globular proteins with amyloid-like substructures. We have analyzed these globular proteins and have found proof in the literature that many of them form amyloids more easily than many other globular proteins.

APID Interactomes is a public resource of biological data (http://apid.dep.usal.es) that provides a comprehensive and curated collection of `protein interactomes' for more than 1100 organisms, including 30 species with more than 500 interactions, derived from the integration of experimentally detected protein-to-protein physical interactions (PPIs). We have performed an update of APID database including a redefinition of several key properties of the PPIs to provide a more precise data integration and to avoid false duplicated records. This includes the unification of all the PPIs from five primary databases of molecular interactions (BioGRID, DIP, HPRD, IntAct and MINT), plus the information from two original systematic sources of human data and from experimentally resolved 3D structures (i.e. PDBs, Protein Data Bank files, where more than two distinct proteins have been identified). Thus, APID provides PPIs reported in published research articles (with traceable PMIDs) and detected by valid experimental interaction methods that give evidences about such protein interactions (following the `ontology and controlled vocabulary': www.ebi.ac.uk/ols/ontologies/mi; developed by `HUPO PSI-MI'). Within this data mining framework, all interaction detection methods have been grouped into two main types: (i) `binary' physical direct detection methods and (ii) `indirect' methods. As a result of these redefinitions, APID provides unified protein interactomes including the specific `experimental evidences' that support each PPI, indicating whether the interactions can be considered `binary' (i.e. supported by at least one binary detection method) or not.","kes, hji",1.0,1,2,2,1.0,,

A total of 3,950 primer pairs were identified and developed from EST sequences. The tri and tetra nucleotide repeat motifs were most prevalent (each 24.75%) followed by di-nucleotide repeat motifs. Whole genome-wide analysis found a total of 245,654 SSR repeats across the 16 chromosomes of oil palm, of which 38,717 were compound microsatellite repeats. A web application, OpSatdb, the first microsatellite database of oil palm, was developed using the PHP and MySQL database ( https://ssr.icar.gov.in/index.php ). It is a simple and systematic web-based search engine for searching SSRs based on repeat motif type, repeat type, and primer details. High synteny was observed between oil palm and rice genomes. The mapping of ESTs having SSRs by Blast2GO resulted in the identification of 19.2% sequences with gene ontology (GO) annotations. Randomly, a set of ten genic SSRs and five genomic SSRs were used for validation and genetic diversity on 100 genotypes belonging to the world oil palm genetic resources. The grouping pattern was observed to be broadly in accordance with the geographical origin of the genotypes. The identified genic and genome-wide SSRs can be effectively useful for various genomic applications of oil palm, such as genetic diversity, linkage map construction, mapping of QTLs, marker-assisted selection, and comparative population studies.","kes, hji",1.0,1,2,2,1.0,,

Somatic perturbations of mtDNA are accumulating with age thus it is of great importance to uncover the main sources of mtDNA instability. Recent analyses demonstrated that somatic mtDNA deletions depend on imperfect repeats of various nature between distant mtDNA segments. However, till now there are no comprehensive databases annotating all types of imperfect repeats in numerous species with sequenced complete mitochondrial genome as well as there are no algorithms capable to call all types of imperfect repeats in circular mtDNA.<h4>Results</h4>We implemented na�ve algorithm of pattern recognition by analogy to standard dot-plot construction procedures allowing us to find both perfect and imperfect repeats of four main types: direct, inverted, mirror and complementary. Our algorithm is adapted to specific characteristics of mtDNA such as circularity and an excess of short repeats - it calls imperfect repeats starting from the length of 10 b.p. We constructed interactive web available database ImtRDB depositing perfect and imperfect repeats positions in mtDNAs of more than 3500 Vertebrate species. Additional tools, such as visualization of repeats within a genome, comparison of repeat densities among different genomes and a possibility to download all results make this database useful for many biologists. Our first analyses of the database demonstrated that mtDNA imperfect repeats (i) are usually short; (ii) associated with unfolded DNA structures; (iii) four types of repeats positively correlate with each other forming two equivalent pairs: direct and mirror versus inverted and complementary, with identical nucleotide content and similar distribution between species; (iv) abundance of repeats is negatively associated with GC content; (v) dinucleotides GC versus CG are overrepresented on light chain of mtDNA covered by repeats.<h4>Conclusions</h4>ImtRDB is available at http://bioinfodbs.kantiana.ru/ImtRDB/ .

31416842,Curatopes Melanoma: A Database of Predicted T-cell Epitopes from Overly Expressed Proteins in Metastatic Cutaneous Melanoma.,"Therapeutic anticancer vaccination has been adapted as an immunotherapy in several solid tumors. However, the selection of promising candidates from the total quantity of possible epitopes poses a challenge to clinicians and bioinformaticians alike, and very few epitopes have been tested in experimental or clinical settings to validate their efficacy. Here, we present a comprehensive database of predicted nonmutated peptide epitopes derived from genes that are overly expressed in a group of 32 melanoma biopsies compared with healthy tissues and that were filtered against expression in a curated list of survival-critical tissues. We hypothesize that these """"self-tolerant"""" epitopes have two desirable properties: they do not depend on mutations, being immediately applicable to a large patient collective, and they potentially cause fewer autoimmune reactions. To support epitope selection, we provide an aggregated score of expected therapeutic efficiency as a shortlist mechanism. The database has applications in facilitating epitope selection and trial design and is freely accessible at https://www.curatopes.com. SIGNIFICANCE: A database is presented that predicts and scores antitumor T-cell epitopes, with a focus on tolerability and avoidance of severe autoimmunity, offering a supplementary epitope set for further investigation in immunotherapy.","kes, hji",1.0,1,2,2,1.0,,
31642469,PhenoModifier: a genetic modifier database for elucidating the genetic basis of human phenotypic variation.,"From clinical observations to large-scale sequencing studies, the phenotypic impact of genetic modifiers is evident. To better understand the full spectrum of the genetic contribution to human disease, concerted efforts are needed to construct a useful modifier resource for interpreting the information from sequencing data. Here, we present the PhenoModifier (https://www.biosino.org/PhenoModifier), a manually curated database that provides a comprehensive overview of human genetic modifiers. By manually curating over ten thousand published articles, 3078 records of modifier information were entered into the current version of PhenoModifier, related to 288 different disorders, 2126 genetic modifier variants and 843 distinct modifier genes. To help users probe further into the mechanism of their interested modifier genes, we extended the yeast genetic interaction data and yeast quantitative trait loci to the human and we also integrated GWAS data into the PhenoModifier to assist users in evaluating all possible phenotypes associated with a modifier allele. As the first comprehensive resource of human genetic modifiers, PhenoModifier provides a more complete spectrum of genetic factors contributing to human phenotypic variation. The portal has a broad scientific and clinical scope, spanning activities relevant to variant interpretation for research purposes as well as clinical decision making.","kes, hji",1.0,1,2,2,1.0,,

To accommodate the increasing amount and complexity of bovine genomics data, BGD continues to advance its practices in data acquisition, curation, integration and efficient data retrieval. BGD provides tools for genome browsing (JBrowse), genome annotation (Apollo), data mining (BovineMine) and sequence database searching (BLAST). To augment the BGD genome annotation capabilities, we have developed a new Apollo plug-in, called the Locus-Specific Alternate Assembly (LSAA) tool, which enables users to identify and report potential genome assembly errors and structural variants. BGD now hosts both the newest bovine reference genome assembly, ARS-UCD1.2, as well as the previous reference genome, UMD3.1.1, with cross-genome navigation and queries supported in JBrowse and BovineMine, respectively. Other notable enhancements to BovineMine include the incorporation of genomes and gene annotation datasets for non-bovine ruminant species (goat and sheep), support for multiple assemblies per organism in the Regions Search tool, integration of additional ontologies and development of many new template queries. To better serve the research community, we continue to focus on improving existing tools, developing new tools, adding new datasets and encouraging researchers to use these resources.","kes, hji",1.0,1,2,2,1.0,,
32159215,TeaMiD: a comprehensive database of simple sequence repeat markers of tea.,"Tea is a highly cross-pollinated, woody, perennial tree. High heterozygosity combined with a long gestational period makes conventional breeding a cumbersome process. Therefore, marker-assisted breeding is a better alternative approach when compared with conventional breeding. Considering the large genome size of tea (~3�Gb), information about simple sequence repeat (SSR) is scanty. Thus, we have taken advantage of the recently published tea genomes to identify large numbers of SSR markers in the tea. Besides the genomic sequences, we identified SSRs from the other publicly available sequences such as RNA-seq, GSS, ESTs and organelle genomes (chloroplasts and mitochondrial) and also searched published literature to catalog validated set of tea SSR markers. The complete exercise yielded a total of 935 547 SSRs. Out of the total, 82 SSRs were selected for validation among a diverse set of tea genotypes. Six primers (each with four to six alleles, an average of five alleles per locus) out of the total 27 polymorphic primers were used for a diversity analysis in 36 tea genotypes with mean polymorphic information content of 0.61-0.76. Finally, using all the information generated in this study, we have developed a user-friendly database (TeaMiD; http://indianteagenome.in:8080/teamid/) that hosts SSR from all the six resources including three nuclear genomes of tea and transcriptome sequences of 17 Camellia wild species.

32277449,Choice of the Promoter for Tissue and Developmental Stage-Specific Gene Expression.,"Transgenic technologies belong to important tools of reverse genetics and biotechnology in plants. Targeted genetic modifications can reveal functions of genes of interest, change metabolic and regulatory pathways, or result in accumulation of valuable proteins or metabolites. However, to be efficient in targeted genetic modification, the chimeric gene construct should be designed properly. In particular, the promoters used to control transgene expression need to be carefully chosen. Most promoters in widely used vectors belong to strong and constitutively expressed variants. However, in many cases transgene expression has to be restricted to certain tissue, stage of development, or response to some internal or external stimuli. In turn, a large variety of tissue-specific promoters have been studied and information on their characteristics may be recovered from the literature. An appropriate promoter may be selected and used in genetic construct to optimize the transgene transcription pattern. We have previously designed the TGP database (TransGene Promoters, http://wwwmgs.bionet.nsc.ru/mgs/dbases/tgp/home.html ) collecting information from the publications in this field. Here we review the wide range of noncanonical tissue-specific and developmentally regulated promoters that might be used for transgene expression control.","kes, hji",1.0,1,2,2,1.0,,iffy

One of the critical obstacles for the use of proteins in biotechnological applications is their insufficient stability at elevated temperatures or in the presence of salts. Since experimental screening for stabilizing mutations is typically laborious and expensive, in silico predictors are often used for narrowing down the mutational landscape. The recent advances in machine learning and artificial intelligence further facilitate the development of such computational tools. However, the accuracy of these predictors strongly depends on the quality and amount of data used for training and testing, which have often been reported as the current bottleneck of the approach. To address this problem, we present a novel database of experimental thermostability data for single-point mutants FireProtDB. The database combines the published datasets, data extracted manually from the recent literature, and the data collected in our laboratory.

Each entry in the database contains relevant background information on how the data was compiled as well as the total energy of each molecular system and interfragment interaction energy (IFIE) and pair interaction energy decomposition analysis (PIEDA) values. Currently, the database contains more than 13�600 FMO calculation data sets, and a comprehensive search function implemented at the front-end. The procedure for selecting target proteins, preprocessing the experimental structures, construction of the database, and details of the database front-end were described. Then, we demonstrated a use of the FMODB by comparing IFIE value distributions of hydrogen bond, ion-pair, and XH/p interactions obtained by FMO method to those by molecular mechanics approach. From the comparison, the statistical analysis of the data provided standard reference values for the three types of interactions that will be useful for determining whether each interaction in a given system is relatively strong or weak compared to the interactions contained within the data in the FMODB. In the final part, we demonstrate the use of the database to examine the contribution of halogen atoms to the binding affinity between human cathepsin L and its inhibitors. We found that the electrostatic term derived by PIEDA greatly correlated with the binding affinities of the halogen containing cathepsin L inhibitors, indicating the importance of QM calculation for quantitative analysis of halogen interactions. Thus, the FMO calculation data in FMODB will be useful for conducting statistical analyses to drug discovery, for conducting molecular recognition studies in structural biology, and for other studies involving quantum mechanics-based interactions.","kes, hji",1.0,1,2,2,1.0,,

A wealth of information about drug and small molecule structure, targets, indications and side effects; induced gene expression signatures; and other attributes are publicly available through web-based tools, databases and repositories. By processing, abstracting and aggregating information from these resources into drug set libraries, knowledge about novel properties of drugs and small molecules can be systematically imputed with machine learning. In addition, drug set libraries can be used as the underlying database for drug set enrichment analysis. Here, we present Drugmonizome, a database with a search engine for querying annotated sets of drugs and small molecules for performing drug set enrichment analysis. Utilizing the data within Drugmonizome, we also developed Drugmonizome-ML. Drugmonizome-ML enables users to construct customized machine learning pipelines using the drug set libraries from Drugmonizome.

26098815,From Ramachandran Maps to Tertiary Structures of Proteins.,"Sequence to structure of proteins is an unsolved problem. A possible coarse grained resolution to this entails specification of all the torsional (F, <U+03A8>) angles along the backbone of the polypeptide chain. The Ramachandran map quite elegantly depicts the allowed conformational (F, <U+03A8>) space of proteins which is still very large for the purposes of accurate structure generation. We have divided the allowed (F, <U+03A8>) space in Ramachandran maps into 27 distinct conformations sufficient to regenerate a structure to within 5 � from the native, at least for small proteins, thus reducing the structure prediction problem to a specification of an alphanumeric string, i.e., the amino acid sequence together with one of the 27 conformations preferred by each amino acid residue. This still theoretically results in 27(n) conformations for a protein comprising """"n"""" amino acids. We then investigated the spatial correlations at the two-residue (dipeptide) and three-residue (tripeptide) levels in what may be described as higher order Ramachandran maps, with the premise that the allowed conformational space starts to shrink as we introduce neighborhood effects. We found, for instance, for a tripeptide which potentially can exist in any of the 27(3) """"allowed"""" conformations, three-fourths of these conformations are redundant to the 95% confidence level, suggesting sequence context dependent preferred conformations. We then created a look-up table of preferred conformations at the tripeptide level and correlated them with energetically favorable conformations. We found in particular that Boltzmann probabilities calculated from van der Waals energies for each conformation of tripeptides correlate well with the observed populations in the structural database (the average correlation coefficient is ~0.8). An alpha-numeric string and hence the tertiary structure can be generated for any sequence from the look-up table within minutes on a single processor and to a higher level of accuracy if secondary structure can be specified. We tested the methodology on 100 small proteins, and in 90% of the cases, a structure within 5 � is recovered. We thus believe that the method presented here provides the missing link between Ramachandran maps and tertiary structures of proteins. A Web server to convert a tertiary structure to an alphanumeric string and to predict the tertiary structure from the sequence of a protein using the above methodology is created and made freely accessible at http://www.scfbio-iitd.res.in/software/proteomics/rm2ts.jsp.","kes, hji",0.0,0,0,2,0.0,,

However, in some infected individuals, this can progress to severe pneumonia and acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), leading to multi-organ failure and death. This study explores the proteomic differences between mild, severe, and critical COVID-19 positive patients to further understand the disease progression, identify proteins associated with disease severity, and identify potential therapeutic targets. Blood protein profiling was performed on 59 COVID-19 mild (n = 26), severe (n = 9) or critical (n = 24) cases and 28 controls using the OLINK inflammation, autoimmune, cardiovascular and neurology panels. Differential expression analysis was performed within and between disease groups to generate nine different analyses. From the 368 proteins measured per individual, more than 75% were observed to be significantly perturbed in COVID-19 cases. Six proteins (IL6, CKAP4, Gal-9, IL-1ra, LILRB4 and PD-L1) were identified to be associated with disease severity. The results have been made readily available through an interactive web-based application for instant data exploration and visualization, and can be accessed at https://phidatalab-shiny.rosalind.kcl.ac.uk/COVID19/ . Our results demonstrate that dynamic changes in blood proteins associated with disease severity can potentially be used as early biomarkers to monitor disease severity in COVID-19 and serve as potential therapeutic targets.","kes, hji",0.0,0,0,2,0.0,,

21208984,Model selection in Bayesian segmentation of multiple DNA alignments.,"<h4>Motivation</h4>The analysis of multiple sequence alignments is allowing researchers to glean valuable insights into evolution, as well as identify genomic regions that may be functional, or discover novel classes of functional elements. Understanding the distribution of conservation levels that constitutes the evolutionary landscape is crucial to distinguishing functional regions from non-functional. Recent evidence suggests that a binary classification of evolutionary rates is inappropriate for this purpose and finds only highly conserved functional elements. Given that the distribution of evolutionary rates is multi-modal, determining the number of modes is of paramount concern. Through simulation, we evaluate the performance of a number of information criterion approaches derived from MCMC simulations in determining the dimension of a model.<h4>Results</h4>We utilize a deviance information criterion (DIC) approximation that is more robust than the approximations from other information criteria, and show our information criteria approximations do not produce superfluous modes when estimating conservation distributions under a variety of circumstances. We analyse the distribution of conservation for a multiple alignment comprising four primate species and mouse, and repeat this on two additional multiple alignments of similar species. We find evidence of six distinct classes of evolutionary rates that appear to be robust to the species used.<h4>Availability</h4>Source code and data are available at http://dl.dropbox.com/u/477240/changept.zip.","kes, hji",0.0,0,0,2,0.0,,data available but on dropbox
21226895,Shape-based peak identification for ChIP-Seq.,"<h4>Background</h4>The identification of binding targets for proteins using ChIP-Seq has gained popularity as an alternative to ChIP-chip. Sequencing can, in principle, eliminate artifacts associated with microarrays, and cheap sequencing offers the ability to sequence deeply and obtain a comprehensive survey of binding. A number of algorithms have been developed to call """"peaks"""" representing bound regions from mapped reads. Most current algorithms incorporate multiple heuristics, and despite much work it remains difficult to accurately determine individual peaks corresponding to distinct binding events.<h4>Results</h4>Our method for identifying statistically significant peaks from read coverage is inspired by the notion of persistence in topological data analysis and provides a non-parametric approach that is statistically sound and robust to noise in experiments. Specifically, our method reduces the peak calling problem to the study of tree-based statistics derived from the data. We validate our approach using previously published data and show that it can discover previously missed regions.<h4>Conclusions</h4>The difficulty in accurately calling peaks for ChIP-Seq data is partly due to the difficulty in defining peaks, and we demonstrate a novel method that improves on the accuracy of previous methods in resolving peaks. Our introduction of a robust statistical test based on ideas from topological data analysis is also novel.

Although there are more than 750 active registered servers from around 50 organizations, setting up a DAS server comprises a fair amount of work, making it difficult for many research groups to share their biological annotations. Given the clear advantage that the generalized sharing of relevant biological data is for the research community it would be desirable to facilitate the sharing process.<h4>Results</h4>Here we present easyDAS, a web-based system enabling anyone to publish biological annotations with just some clicks. The system, available at http://www.ebi.ac.uk/panda-srv/easydas is capable of reading different standard data file formats, process the data and create a new publicly available DAS source in a completely automated way. The created sources are hosted on the EBI systems and can take advantage of its high storage capacity and network connection, freeing the data provider from any network management work. easyDAS is an open source project under the GNU LGPL license.<h4>Conclusions</h4>easyDAS is an automated DAS source creation system which can help many researchers in sharing their biological data, potentially increasing the amount of relevant biological data available to the scientific community.","kes, hji",0.0,0,0,2,0.0,,
21256977,AskHERMES: An online question answering system for complex clinical questions.,"<h4>Objective</h4>Clinical questions are often long and complex and take many forms. We have built a clinical question answering system named AskHERMES to perform robust semantic analysis on complex clinical questions and output question-focused extractive summaries as answers.<h4>Design</h4>This paper describes the system architecture and a preliminary evaluation of AskHERMES, which implements innovative approaches in question analysis, summarization, and answer presentation. Five types of resources were indexed in this system: MEDLINE abstracts, PubMed Central full-text articles, eMedicine documents, clinical guidelines and Wikipedia articles.<h4>Measurement</h4>We compared the AskHERMES system with Google (Google and Google Scholar) and UpToDate and asked physicians to score the three systems by ease of use, quality of answer, time spent, and overall performance.<h4>Results</h4>AskHERMES allows physicians to enter a question in a natural way with minimal query formulation and allows physicians to efficiently navigate among all the answer sentences to quickly meet their information needs. In contrast, physicians need to formulate queries to search for information in Google and UpToDate. The development of the AskHERMES system is still at an early stage, and the knowledge resource is limited compared with Google or UpToDate. Nevertheless, the evaluation results show that AskHERMES' performance is comparable to the other systems. In particular, when answering complex clinical questions, it demonstrates the potential to outperform both Google and UpToDate systems.<h4>Conclusions</h4>AskHERMES, available at http://www.AskHERMES.org, has the potential to help physicians practice evidence-based medicine and improve the quality of patient care.","kes, hji",0.0,0,0,2,0.0,,
21266443,An efficient hierarchical generalized linear mixed model for pathway analysis of genome-wide association studies.,"<h4>Motivation</h4>In genome-wide association studies (GWAS) of complex diseases, genetic variants having real but weak associations often fail to be detected at the stringent genome-wide significance level. Pathway analysis, which tests disease association with combined association signals from a group of variants in the same pathway, has become increasingly popular. However, because of the complexities in genetic data and the large sample sizes in typical GWAS, pathway analysis remains to be challenging. We propose a new statistical model for pathway analysis of GWAS. This model includes a fixed effects component that models mean disease association for a group of genes, and a random effects component that models how each gene's association with disease varies about the gene group mean, thus belongs to the class of mixed effects models.<h4>Results</h4>The proposed model is computationally efficient and uses only summary statistics. In addition, it corrects for the presence of overlapping genes and linkage disequilibrium (LD). Via simulated and real GWAS data, we showed our model improved power over currently available pathway analysis methods while preserving type I error rate. Furthermore, using the WTCCC Type 1 Diabetes (T1D) dataset, we demonstrated mixed model analysis identified meaningful biological processes that agreed well with previous reports on T1D. Therefore, the proposed methodology provides an efficient statistical modeling framework for systems analysis of GWAS.<h4>Availability</h4>The software code for mixed models analysis is freely available at http://biostat.mc.vanderbilt.edu/LilyWang.","kes, hji",0.0,0,0,2,0.0,,
21330288,Sensitive gene fusion detection using ambiguously mapping RNA-Seq read pairs.,"<h4>Motivation</h4>Paired-end whole transcriptome sequencing provides evidence for fusion transcripts. However, due to the repetitiveness of the transcriptome, many reads have multiple high-quality mappings. Previous methods to find gene fusions either ignored these reads or required additional longer single reads. This can obscure up to 30% of fusions and unnecessarily discards much of the data.<h4>Results</h4>We present a method for using paired-end reads to find fusion transcripts without requiring unique mappings or additional single read sequencing. Using simulated data and data from tumors and cell lines, we show that our method can find fusions with ambiguously mapping read pairs without generating numerous spurious fusions from the many mapping locations.<h4>Availability</h4>A C++ and Python implementation of the method demonstrated in this article is available at http://exon.ucsd.edu/ShortFuse.<h4>Contact</h4>mckinsel@ucsd.edu<h4>Supplementary information</h4>Supplementary data are available at Bioinformatics online.","kes, hji",0.0,0,0,2,0.0,,

In particular, subgroups of strongly coexpressed gene pairs result in an increased variance of the correlation distribution. This variance, a measure of association between sets of genes (or proteins), can be summarized as the bimodality of coexpression (BiC). We developed an online tool to calculate the BiC for user-defined gene lists and associated mRNA expression data.

Here, we survey the field of high-throughput methods for 3-D structure prediction and set up new target specifications for the next generation of methods. We then introduce COSMOS, a novel data-driven prediction method that utilizes libraries of fragment and torsion angle parameters. We illustrate COSMOS using parameters extracted from the Cambridge Structural Database (CSD) by analyzing their distribution and then evaluating the system's performance in terms of speed, coverage, and accuracy. Results show that COSMOS represents a significant improvement when compared to state-of-the-art prediction methods, particularly in terms of coverage of complex molecular structures, including metal-organics. COSMOS can predict structures for 96.4% of the molecules in the CSD (99.6% organic, 94.6% metal-organic), whereas the widely used commercial method CORINA predicts structures for 68.5% (98.5% organic, 51.6% metal-organic). On the common subset of molecules predicted by both methods, COSMOS makes predictions with an average speed per molecule of 0.15 s (0.10 s organic, 0.21 s metal-organic) and an average rmsd of 1.57 � (1.26 � organic, 1.90 � metal-organic), and CORINA makes predictions with an average speed per molecule of 0.13s (0.18s organic, 0.08s metal-organic) and an average rmsd of 1.60 � (1.13 � organic, 2.11 � metal-organic).

21435986,A potential causal association mining algorithm for screening adverse drug reactions in postmarketing surveillance.,"Early detection of unknown adverse drug reactions (ADRs) in postmarketing surveillance saves lives and prevents harmful consequences. We propose a novel data mining approach to signaling potential ADRs from electronic health databases. More specifically, we introduce potential causal association rules (PCARs) to represent the potential causal relationship between a drug and ICD-9 (CDC. (2010). International Classification of Diseases, Ninth Revision (ICD-9). [Online]. Available: http://www.cdc.gov/nchs/icd/icd9.html) coded signs or symptoms representing potential ADRs. Due to the infrequent nature of ADRs, the existing frequency-based data mining methods cannot effectively discover PCARs. We introduce a new interestingness measure, potential causal leverage, to quantify the degree of association of a PCAR. This measure is based on the computational, experience-based fuzzy recognition-primed decision (RPD) model that we developed previously (Y. Ji, R. M. Massanari, J. Ager, J. Yen, R. E. Miller, and H. Ying, """"A fuzzy logic-based computational recognition-primed decision model,"""" Inf. Sci., vol. 177, pp. 4338-4353, 2007) on the basis of the well-known, psychology-originated qualitative RPD model (G. A. Klein, """"A recognition-primed decision making model of rapid decision making,"""" in Decision Making in Action: Models and Methods, 1993, pp. 138-147). The potential causal leverage assesses the strength of the association of a drug-symptom pair given a collection of patient cases. To test our data mining approach, we retrieved electronic medical data for 16,206 patients treated by one or more than eight drugs of our interest at the Veterans Affairs Medical Center in Detroit between 2007 and 2009. We selected enalapril as the target drug for this ADR signal generation study. We used our algorithm to preliminarily evaluate the associations between enalapril and all the ICD-9 codes associated with it. The experimental results indicate that our approach has a potential to better signal potential ADRs than risk ratio and leverage, two traditional frequency-based measures. Among the top 50 signal pairs (i.e., enalapril versus symptoms) ranked by the potential causal-leverage measure, the physicians on the project determined that eight of them probably represent true causal associations.","kes, hji",0.0,0,0,2,0.0,,
21467568,Increasing power of genome-wide association studies by collecting additional single-nucleotide polymorphisms.,"Genome-wide association studies (GWASs) have been effectively identifying the genomic regions associated with a disease trait. In a typical GWAS, an informative subset of the single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs), called tag SNPs, is genotyped in case/control individuals. Once the tag SNP statistics are computed, the genomic regions that are in linkage disequilibrium (LD) with the most significantly associated tag SNPs are believed to contain the causal polymorphisms. However, such LD regions are often large and contain many additional polymorphisms. Following up all the SNPs included in these regions is costly and infeasible for biological validation. In this article we address how to characterize these regions cost effectively with the goal of providing investigators a clear direction for biological validation. We introduce a follow-up study approach for identifying all untyped associated SNPs by selecting additional SNPs, called follow-up SNPs, from the associated regions and genotyping them in the original case/control individuals. We introduce a novel SNP selection method with the goal of maximizing the number of associated SNPs among the chosen follow-up SNPs. We show how the observed statistics of the original tag SNPs and human genetic variation reference data such as the HapMap Project can be utilized to identify the follow-up SNPs. We use simulated and real association studies based on the HapMap data and the Wellcome Trust Case Control Consortium to demonstrate that our method shows superior performance to the correlation- and distance-based traditional follow-up SNP selection approaches.

21496265,SNP-based pathway enrichment analysis for genome-wide association studies.,"<h4>Background</h4>Recently we have witnessed a surge of interest in using genome-wide association studies (GWAS) to discover the genetic basis of complex diseases. Many genetic variations, mostly in the form of single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs), have been identified in a wide spectrum of diseases, including diabetes, cancer, and psychiatric diseases. A common theme arising from these studies is that the genetic variations discovered by GWAS can only explain a small fraction of the genetic risks associated with the complex diseases. New strategies and statistical approaches are needed to address this lack of explanation. One such approach is the pathway analysis, which considers the genetic variations underlying a biological pathway, rather than separately as in the traditional GWAS studies. A critical challenge in the pathway analysis is how to combine evidences of association over multiple SNPs within a gene and multiple genes within a pathway. Most current methods choose the most significant SNP from each gene as a representative, ignoring the joint action of multiple SNPs within a gene. This approach leads to preferential identification of genes with a greater number of SNPs.<h4>Results</h4>We describe a SNP-based pathway enrichment method for GWAS studies. The method consists of the following two main steps: 1) for a given pathway, using an adaptive truncated product statistic to identify all representative (potentially more than one) SNPs of each gene, calculating the average number of representative SNPs for the genes, then re-selecting the representative SNPs of genes in the pathway based on this number; and 2) ranking all selected SNPs by the significance of their statistical association with a trait of interest, and testing if the set of SNPs from a particular pathway is significantly enriched with high ranks using a weighted Kolmogorov-Smirnov test. We applied our method to two large genetically distinct GWAS data sets of schizophrenia, one from European-American (EA) and the other from African-American (AA). In the EA data set, we found 22 pathways with nominal P-value less than or equal to 0.001 and corresponding false discovery rate (FDR) less than 5%. In the AA data set, we found 11 pathways by controlling the same nominal P-value and FDR threshold. Interestingly, 8 of these pathways overlap with those found in the EA sample. We have implemented our method in a JAVA software package, called SNP Set Enrichment Analysis (SSEA), which contains a user-friendly interface and is freely available at http://cbcl.ics.uci.edu/SSEA.<h4>Conclusions</h4>The SNP-based pathway enrichment method described here offers a new alternative approach for analysing GWAS data. By applying it to schizophrenia GWAS studies, we show that our method is able to identify statistically significant pathways, and importantly, pathways that can be replicated in large genetically distinct samples.","kes, hji",0.0,0,0,2,0.0,,
21546392,Boulder ALignment Editor (ALE): a web-based RNA alignment tool.,"<h4>Summary</h4>The explosion of interest in non-coding RNAs, together with improvements in RNA X-ray crystallography, has led to a rapid increase in RNA structures at atomic resolution from 847 in 2005 to 1900 in 2010. The success of whole-genome sequencing has led to an explosive growth of unaligned homologous sequences. Consequently, there is a compelling and urgent need for user-friendly tools for producing structure-informed RNA alignments. Most alignment software considers the primary sequence alone; some specialized alignment software can also include Watson-Crick base pairs, but none adequately addresses the needs introduced by the rapid influx of both sequence and structural data. Therefore, we have developed the Boulder ALignment Editor (ALE), which is a web-based RNA alignment editor, designed for editing and assessing alignments using structural information. Some features of BoulderALE include the annotation and evaluation of an alignment based on isostericity of Watson-Crick and non-Watson-Crick base pairs, along with the collapsing (horizontally and vertically) of the alignment, while maintaining the ability to edit the alignment.<h4>Availability</h4>http://www.microbio.me/boulderale.","kes, hji",0.0,0,0,2,0.0,,
21546400,Mixture models for analysis of the taxonomic composition of metagenomes.,"<h4>Motivation</h4>Inferring the taxonomic profile of a microbial community from a large collection of anonymous DNA sequencing reads is a challenging task in metagenomics. Because existing methods for taxonomic profiling of metagenomes are all based on the assignment of fragmentary sequences to phylogenetic categories, the accuracy of results largely depends on fragment length. This dependence complicates comparative analysis of data originating from different sequencing platforms or resulting from different preprocessing pipelines.<h4>Results</h4>We here introduce a new method for taxonomic profiling based on mixture modeling of the overall oligonucleotide distribution of a sample. Our results indicate that the mixture-based profiles compare well with taxonomic profiles obtained with other methods. However, in contrast to the existing methods, our approach shows a nearly constant profiling accuracy across all kinds of read lengths and it operates at an unrivaled speed.<h4>Availability</h4>A platform-independent implementation of the mixture modeling approach is available in terms of a MATLAB/Octave toolbox at http://gobics.de/peter/taxy.

21554765,Enhancing genome assemblies by integrating non-sequence based data.,"<h4>Introduction</h4>Many genome projects were underway before the advent of high-throughput sequencing and have thus been supported by a wealth of genome information from other technologies. Such information frequently takes the form of linkage and physical maps, both of which can provide a substantial amount of data useful in de novo sequencing projects. Furthermore, the recent abundance of genome resources enables the use of conserved synteny maps identified in related species to further enhance genome assemblies.<h4>Methods</h4>The tammar wallaby (Macropus eugenii) is a model marsupial mammal with a low coverage genome. However, we have access to extensive comparative maps containing over 14,000 markers constructed through the physical mapping of conserved loci, chromosome painting and comprehensive linkage maps. Using a custom Bioperl pipeline, information from the maps was aligned to assembled tammar wallaby contigs using BLAT. This data was used to construct pseudo paired-end libraries with intervals ranging from 5-10 MB. We then used Bambus (a program designed to scaffold eukaryotic genomes by ordering and orienting contigs through the use of paired-end data) to scaffold our libraries. To determine how map data compares to sequence based approaches to enhance assemblies, we repeated the experiment using a 0.5� coverage of unique reads from 4 KB and 8 KB Illumina paired-end libraries. Finally, we combined both the sequence and non-sequence-based data to determine how a combined approach could further enhance the quality of the low coverage de novo reconstruction of the tammar wallaby genome.<h4>Results</h4>Using the map data alone, we were able order 2.2% of the initial contigs into scaffolds, and increase the N50 scaffold size to 39 KB (36 KB in the original assembly). Using only the 0.5� paired-end sequence based data, 53% of the initial contigs were assigned to scaffolds. Combining both data sets resulted in a further 2% increase in the number of initial contigs integrated into a scaffold (55% total) but a 35% increase in N50 scaffold size over the use of sequence-based data alone.<h4>Conclusions</h4>We provide a relatively simple pipeline utilizing existing bioinformatics tools to integrate map data into a genome assembly which is available at http://www.mcb.uconn.edu/fac.php?name=paska. While the map data only contributed minimally to assigning the initial contigs to scaffolds in the new assembly, it greatly increased the N50 size. This process added structure to our low coverage assembly, greatly increasing its utility in further analyses.","kes, hji",0.0,0,0,2,0.0,,
21590677,Evaluation of the positional difference between two common geocoding methods.,"Geocoding, the process of matching addresses to geographic coordinates, is a necessary first step when using geographical information systems (GIS) technology. However, different geocoding methodologies can result in different geographic coordinates. The objective of this study was to compare the positional (i.e. longitude/latitude) difference between two common geocoding methods, i.e. ArcGIS (Environmental System Research Institute, Redlands, CA, USA) and Batchgeo (freely available online at http://www.batchgeo.com). Address data came from the YMCA-Harvard After School Food and Fitness Project, an obesity prevention intervention involving children aged 5-11 years and their families participating in YMCA-administered, after-school programmes located in four geographically diverse metropolitan areas in the USA. Our analyses include baseline addresses (n = 748) collected from the parents of the children in the after school sites. Addresses were first geocoded to the street level and assigned longitude and latitude coordinates with ArcGIS, version 9.3, then the same addresses were geocoded with Batchgeo. For this analysis, the ArcGIS minimum match score was 80. The resulting geocodes were projected into state plane coordinates, and the difference in longitude and latitude coordinates were calculated in meters between the two methods for all data points in each of the four metropolitan areas. We also quantified the descriptions of the geocoding accuracy provided by Batchgeo with the match scores from ArcGIS. We found a 94% match rate (n = 705), 2% (n = 18) were tied and 3% (n = 25) were unmatched using ArcGIS. Forty-eight addresses (6.4%) were not matched in ArcGIS with a match score =80 (therefore only 700 addresses were included in our positional difference analysis). Six hundred thirteen (87.6%) of these addresses had a match score of 100. Batchgeo yielded a 100% match rate for the addresses that ArcGIS geocoded. The median for longitude and latitude coordinates for all the data was just over 25 m. Overall, the range for longitude was 0.04-12,911.8 m, and the range for latitude was 0.02-37,766.6 m. Comparisons show minimal differences in the median and minimum values, while there were slightly larger differences in the maximum values. The majority (>75%) of the geographic differences were within 50 m of each other; mostly <25 m from each other (about 49%). Only about 4% overall were =400 m apart. We also found geographic differences in the proportion of addresses that fell within certain meter ranges. The match-score range associated with the Batchgeo accuracy level """"approximate"""" (least accurate) was 84-100 (mean = 92), while the """"rooftop"""" Batchgeo accuracy level (most accurate) delivered a mean of 98.9 but the range was the same. Although future research should compare the positional difference of Batchgeo to criterion measures of longitude/latitude (e.g. with global positioning system measurement), this study suggests that Batchgeo is a good, free-of-charge option to geocode addresses.","kes, hji",0.0,0,0,2,0.0,,

These guidelines were periodically updated in past years.<h4>Objective</h4>The aim of this paper is to present a summary of the 2009 update of the EAU guidelines on urinary incontinence (UI).<h4>Evidence acquisition</h4>The EAU working panel was part of the 4th International Consultation on Incontinence (ICI) and, with permission of the ICI, extracted the relevant data. The methodology of the 4th ICI was a comprehensive literature review by international experts and consensus formation. In addition, level of evidence was rated according to a modified Oxford system and grades of recommendation were given accordingly.<h4>Evidence summary</h4>A full version of the EAU guidelines on urinary incontinence is available as a printed document (extended and short form) and as a CD-ROM from the EAU office or online from the EAU Web site (http://www.uroweb.org/guidelines/online-guidelines/). The extent and invasiveness of assessment of UI depends on severity and/or complexity of symptoms and clinical signs and is different for men, women, frail older persons, children, and patients with neuropathy. At the level of initial management, basic diagnostic tests are applied to exclude an underlying disease or condition such as urinary tract infection. Treatment is mostly conservative (lifestyle interventions, physiotherapy, physical therapy, pharmacotherapy) and is of an empirical nature. At the level of specialised management (when primary therapy failed, diagnosis is unclear, or symptoms and/or signs are complex/severe),more elaborate assessment is generally required, including imaging, endoscopy, and urodynamics. Treatment options include invasive interventions and surgery.<h4>Conclusions</h4>Treatment options for UI are rapidly expanding. These EAU guidelines provide ratings of the evidence (guided by evidence-based medicine) and graded recommendations for the appropriate assessment and according treatment options and put them into clinical perspective.","kes, hji",0.0,0,0,2,0.0,,

By modeling the patterns of linkage disequilibrium in a reference panel, genotypes not directly measured in the study samples can be imputed and used for GWASs. Since millions of single nucleotide polymorphisms need to be imputed in a GWAS, faster methods for genotype imputation and haplotype reconstruction are required.<h4>Results</h4>We developed a program package for parallel computation of genotype imputation and haplotype reconstruction. Our program package, ParaHaplo 3.0, is intended for use in workstation clusters using the Intel Message Passing Interface. We compared the performance of ParaHaplo 3.0 on the Japanese in Tokyo, Japan and Han Chinese in Beijing, and Chinese in the HapMap dataset. A parallel version of ParaHaplo 3.0 can conduct genotype imputation 20 times faster than a non-parallel version of ParaHaplo.<h4>Conclusions</h4>ParaHaplo 3.0 is an invaluable tool for conducting haplotype-based GWASs.

21624157,How orthogonal are the OBO Foundry ontologies?,"<h4>Background</h4>Ontologies in biomedicine facilitate information integration, data exchange, search and query of biomedical data, and other critical knowledge-intensive tasks. The OBO Foundry is a collaborative effort to establish a set of principles for ontology development with the eventual goal of creating a set of interoperable reference ontologies in the domain of biomedicine. One of the key requirements to achieve this goal is to ensure that ontology developers reuse term definitions that others have already created rather than create their own definitions, thereby making the ontologies orthogonal.<h4>Methods</h4>We used a simple lexical algorithm to analyze the extent to which the set of OBO Foundry candidate ontologies identified from September 2009 to September 2010 conforms to this vision. Specifically, we analyzed (1) the level of explicit term reuse in this set of ontologies, (2) the level of overlap, where two ontologies define similar terms independently, and (3) how the levels of reuse and overlap changed during the course of this year.<h4>Results</h4>We found that 30% of the ontologies reuse terms from other Foundry candidates and 96% of the candidate ontologies contain terms that overlap with terms from the other ontologies. We found that while term reuse increased among the ontologies between September 2009 and September 2010, the level of overlap among the ontologies remained relatively constant. Additionally, we analyzed the six ontologies announced as OBO Foundry members on March 5, 2010, and identified that the level of overlap was extremely low, but, notably, so was the level of term reuse.<h4>Conclusions</h4>We have created a prototype web application that allows OBO Foundry ontology developers to see which classes from their ontologies overlap with classes from other ontologies in the OBO Foundry (http://obomap.bioontology.org). From our analysis, we conclude that while the OBO Foundry has made significant progress toward orthogonality during the period of this study through increased adoption of explicit term reuse, a large amount of overlap remains among these ontologies. Furthermore, the characteristics of the identified overlap, such as the terms it comprises and its distribution among the ontologies, indicate that the achieving orthogonality will be exceptionally difficult, if not impossible.","kes, hji",0.0,0,0,2,0.0,,for analysis only it seems
21708002,A mutation degree model for the identification of transcriptional regulatory elements.,"<h4>Background</h4>Current approaches for identifying transcriptional regulatory elements are mainly via the combination of two properties, the evolutionary conservation and the overrepresentation of functional elements in the promoters of co-regulated genes. Despite the development of many motif detection algorithms, the discovery of conserved motifs in a wide range of phylogenetically related promoters is still a challenge, especially for the short motifs embedded in distantly related gene promoters or very closely related promoters, or in the situation that there are not enough orthologous genes available.<h4>Results</h4>A mutation degree model is proposed and a new word counting method is developed for the identification of transcriptional regulatory elements from a set of co-expressed genes. The new method comprises two parts: 1) identifying overrepresented oligo-nucleotides in promoters of co-expressed genes, 2) estimating the conservation of the oligo-nucleotides in promoters of phylogenetically related genes by the mutation degree model. Compared with the performance of other algorithms, our method shows the advantages of low false positive rate and higher specificity, especially the robustness to noisy data. Applying the method to co-expressed gene sets from Arabidopsis, most of known cis-elements were successfully detected. The tool and example are available at http://mcube.nju.edu.cn/jwang/lab/soft/ocw/OCW.html.<h4>Conclusions</h4>The mutation degree model proposed in this paper is adapted to phylogenetic data of different qualities, and to a wide range of evolutionary distances. The new word-counting method based on this model has the advantage of better performance in detecting short sequence of cis-elements from co-expressed genes of eukaryotes and is robust to less complete phylogenetic data.","kes, hji",0.0,0,0,2,0.0,,

21750706,GenExp: an interactive web-based genomic DAS client with client-side data rendering.,"<h4>Background</h4>The Distributed Annotation System (DAS) offers a standard protocol for sharing and integrating annotations on biological sequences. There are more than 1000 DAS sources available and the number is steadily increasing. Clients are an essential part of the DAS system and integrate data from several independent sources in order to create a useful representation to the user. While web-based DAS clients exist, most of them do not have direct interaction capabilities such as dragging and zooming with the mouse.<h4>Results</h4>Here we present GenExp, a web based and fully interactive visual DAS client. GenExp is a genome oriented DAS client capable of creating informative representations of genomic data zooming out from base level to complete chromosomes. It proposes a novel approach to genomic data rendering and uses the latest HTML5 web technologies to create the data representation inside the client browser. Thanks to client-side rendering most position changes do not need a network request to the server and so responses to zooming and panning are almost immediate. In GenExp it is possible to explore the genome intuitively moving it with the mouse just like geographical map applications. Additionally, in GenExp it is possible to have more than one data viewer at the same time and to save the current state of the application to revisit it later on.<h4>Conclusions</h4>GenExp is a new interactive web-based client for DAS and addresses some of the short-comings of the existing clients. It uses client-side data rendering techniques resulting in easier genome browsing and exploration. GenExp is open source under the GPL license and it is freely available at http://gralggen.lsi.upc.edu/recerca/genexp.","kes, hji",0.0,0,0,2,0.0,,

21756356,Statistical mutation calling from sequenced overlapping DNA pools in TILLING experiments.,"<h4>Background</h4>TILLING (Targeting induced local lesions IN genomes) is an efficient reverse genetics approach for detecting induced mutations in pools of individuals. Combined with the high-throughput of next-generation sequencing technologies, and the resolving power of overlapping pool design, TILLING provides an efficient and economical platform for functional genomics across thousands of organisms.<h4>Results</h4>We propose a probabilistic method for calling TILLING-induced mutations, and their carriers, from high throughput sequencing data of overlapping population pools, where each individual occurs in two pools. We assign a probability score to each sequence position by applying Bayes' Theorem to a simplified binomial model of sequencing error and expected mutations, taking into account the coverage level. We test the performance of our method on variable quality, high-throughput sequences from wheat and rice mutagenized populations.<h4>Conclusions</h4>We show that our method effectively discovers mutations in large populations with sensitivity of 92.5% and specificity of 99.8%. It also outperforms existing SNP detection methods in detecting real mutations, especially at higher levels of coverage variability across sequenced pools, and in lower quality short reads sequence data.

It is indexed by NeuroNames, an ontology designed to compensate for ambiguities in neuroanatomical nomenclature. The 20-year old ontology continues to evolve toward the ideal of recognizing all names of neuroanatomical entities and accommodating all structural concepts about which neuroscientists communicate, including multiple concepts of entities for which neuroanatomists have yet to determine the best or 'true' conceptualization. To make the definitions of structural concepts unambiguous and terminologically consistent we created a 'default vocabulary' of unique structure names selected from existing terminology. We selected standard names by criteria designed to maximize practicality for use in verbal communication as well as computerized knowledge management. The ontology of NeuroNames accommodates synonyms and homonyms of the standard terms in many languages. It defines complex structures as models composed of primary structures, which are defined in unambiguous operational terms. NeuroNames currently relates more than 16,000 names in eight languages to some 2,500 neuroanatomical concepts. The ontology is maintained in a relational database with three core tables: Names, Concepts and Models. BrainInfo uses NeuroNames to index information by structure, to interpret users' queries and to clarify terminology on remote web pages. NeuroNames is a resource vocabulary of the NLM's Unified Medical Language System (UMLS, 2011) and the basis for the brain regions component of NIFSTD (NeuroLex, 2011).

Tagged organism mentions also play a pivotal role in disambiguating other entities in a text, such as proteins. A high-precision organism tagging system must be able to detect the numerous forms of organism mentions, including common names as well as the traditional taxonomic groups: genus, species and strains. In addition, such a system must resolve abbreviations and acronyms, assign the scientific name and if possible link the detected mention to the NCBI Taxonomy database for further semantic queries and literature navigation.<h4>Results</h4>We present the OrganismTagger, a hybrid rule-based/machine learning system to extract organism mentions from the literature. It includes tools for automatically generating lexical and ontological resources from a copy of the NCBI Taxonomy database, thereby facilitating system updates by end users. Its novel ontology-based resources can also be reused in other semantic mining and linked data tasks. Each detected organism mention is normalized to a canonical name through the resolution of acronyms and abbreviations and subsequently grounded with an NCBI Taxonomy database ID. In particular, our system combines a novel machine-learning approach with rule-based and lexical methods for detecting strain mentions in documents.

21846404,Prediction of conformational B-cell epitopes from 3D structures by random forests with a distance-based feature.,"<h4>Background</h4>Antigen-antibody interactions are key events in immune system, which provide important clues to the immune processes and responses. In Antigen-antibody interactions, the specific sites on the antigens that are directly bound by the B-cell produced antibodies are well known as B-cell epitopes. The identification of epitopes is a hot topic in bioinformatics because of their potential use in the epitope-based drug design. Although most B-cell epitopes are discontinuous (or conformational), insufficient effort has been put into the conformational epitope prediction, and the performance of existing methods is far from satisfaction.<h4>Results</h4>In order to develop the high-accuracy model, we focus on some possible aspects concerning the prediction performance, including the impact of interior residues, different contributions of adjacent residues, and the imbalanced data which contain much more non-epitope residues than epitope residues. In order to address above issues, we take following strategies. Firstly, a concept of 'thick surface patch' instead of 'surface patch' is introduced to describe the local spatial context of each surface residue, which considers the impact of interior residue. The comparison between the thick surface patch and the surface patch shows that interior residues contribute to the recognition of epitopes. Secondly, statistical significance of the distance distribution difference between non-epitope patches and epitope patches is observed, thus an adjacent residue distance feature is presented, which reflects the unequal contributions of adjacent residues to the location of binding sites. Thirdly, a bootstrapping and voting procedure is adopted to deal with the imbalanced dataset. Based on the above ideas, we propose a new method to identify the B-cell conformational epitopes from 3D structures by combining conventional features and the proposed feature, and the random forest (RF) algorithm is used as the classification engine. The experiments show that our method can predict conformational B-cell epitopes with high accuracy. Evaluated by leave-one-out cross validation (LOOCV), our method achieves the mean AUC value of 0.633 for the benchmark bound dataset, and the mean AUC value of 0.654 for the benchmark unbound dataset. When compared with the state-of-the-art prediction models in the independent test, our method demonstrates comparable or better performance.<h4>Conclusions</h4>Our method is demonstrated to be effective for the prediction of conformational epitopes.

21857117,Eu-Detect: an algorithm for detecting eukaryotic sequences in metagenomic data sets.,"Physical partitioning techniques are routinely employed (during sample preparation stage) for segregating the prokaryotic and eukaryotic fractions of metagenomic samples. In spite of these efforts, several metagenomic studies focusing on bacterial and archaeal populations have reported the presence of contaminating eukaryotic sequences in metagenomic data sets. Contaminating sequences originate not only from genomes of micro-eukaryotic species but also from genomes of (higher) eukaryotic host cells. The latter scenario usually occurs in the case of host-associated metagenomes. Identification and removal of contaminating sequences is important, since these sequences not only impact estimates of microbial diversity but also affect the accuracy of several downstream analyses. Currently, the computational techniques used for identifying contaminating eukaryotic sequences, being alignment based, are slow, inefficient, and require huge computing resources. In this article, we present Eu-Detect, an alignment-free algorithm that can rapidly identify eukaryotic sequences contaminating metagenomic data sets. Validation results indicate that on a desktop with modest hardware specifications, the Eu-Detect algorithm is able to rapidly segregate DNA sequence fragments of prokaryotic and eukaryotic origin, with high sensitivity.

21873327,Finding recurrent copy number alterations preserving within-sample homogeneity.,"<h4>Motivation</h4>Copy number alterations (CNAs) represent an important component of genetic variation and play a significant role in many human diseases. Development of array comparative genomic hybridization (aCGH) technology has made it possible to identify CNAs. Identification of recurrent CNAs represents the first fundamental step to provide a list of genomic regions which form the basis for further biological investigations. The main problem in recurrent CNAs discovery is related to the need to distinguish between functional changes and random events without pathological relevance. Within-sample homogeneity represents a common feature of copy number profile in cancer, so it can be used as additional source of information to increase the accuracy of the results. Although several algorithms aimed at the identification of recurrent CNAs have been proposed, no attempt of a comprehensive comparison of different approaches has yet been published.<h4>Results</h4>We propose a new approach, called Genomic Analysis of Important Alterations (GAIA), to find recurrent CNAs where a statistical hypothesis framework is extended to take into account within-sample homogeneity. Statistical significance and within-sample homogeneity are combined into an iterative procedure to extract the regions that likely are involved in functional changes. Results show that GAIA represents a valid alternative to other proposed approaches. In addition, we perform an accurate comparison by using two real aCGH datasets and a carefully planned simulation study.<h4>Availability</h4>GAIA has been implemented as R/Bioconductor package.

21896882,Functional network construction in Arabidopsis using rule-based machine learning on large-scale data sets.,"The meta-analysis of large-scale postgenomics data sets within public databases promises to provide important novel biological knowledge. Statistical approaches including correlation analyses in coexpression studies of gene expression have emerged as tools to elucidate gene function using these data sets. Here, we present a powerful and novel alternative methodology to computationally identify functional relationships between genes from microarray data sets using rule-based machine learning. This approach, termed """"coprediction,"""" is based on the collective ability of groups of genes co-occurring within rules to accurately predict the developmental outcome of a biological system. We demonstrate the utility of coprediction as a powerful analytical tool using publicly available microarray data generated exclusively from Arabidopsis thaliana seeds to compute a functional gene interaction network, termed Seed Co-Prediction Network (SCoPNet). SCoPNet predicts functional associations between genes acting in the same developmental and signal transduction pathways irrespective of the similarity in their respective gene expression patterns. Using SCoPNet, we identified four novel regulators of seed germination (ALTERED SEED GERMINATION5, 6, 7, and 8), and predicted interactions at the level of transcript abundance between these novel and previously described factors influencing Arabidopsis seed germination. An online Web tool to query SCoPNet has been developed as a community resource to dissect seed biology and is available at http://www.vseed.nottingham.ac.uk/.","kes, hji",0.0,0,0,2,0.0,,
21903624,Finding stable local optimal RNA secondary structures.,"<h4>Motivation</h4>Many RNAs, such as riboswitches, can fold into multiple alternate structures and perform different biological functions. These biologically functional structures usually have low free energies in their local energy landscapes and are very stable such that they cannot easily jump out of the current states and fold into other stable conformations. The conformational space of feasible RNA secondary structures is prohibitively large, and accurate prediction of functional structure conformations is challenging. Because the stability of an RNA secondary structure is determined predominantly by energetically favorable helical regions (stacks), we propose to use configurations of putative stacks to represent RNA secondary structures. By considering a reduced conformational space of local optimal stack configurations instead of all feasible RNA structures, we first present an algorithm for enumerating all possible local optimal stack configurations. In addition, we present a fast heuristic algorithm for approximating energy barriers encountered during folding pathways between each pair of local optimal stack configurations and finding all the stable local optimal structures.<h4>Results</h4>Benchmark tests have been conducted on several RNA riboswitches, whose alternate secondary structures have been experimentally verified. The benchmark results show that our method can successfully predict the native 'on' and 'off' secondary structures, and better rank them compared with other state-of-art approaches.<h4>Availability</h4>The software is freely available and can be downloaded at http://genome.ucf.edu/RNASLOpt.<h4>Contact</h4>shzhang@eecs.ucf.edu.<h4>Supplementary information</h4>Supplementary data are available at Bioinformatics online.","kes, hji",0.0,0,0,2,0.0,,

A recent benchmark of binding affinities has allowed, for the first time, the evaluation and construction of binding free energy models using a diverse set of complexes, and a systematic assessment of our ability to model the energetics of conformational changes.<h4>Results</h4>We construct a large set of molecular descriptors using commonly available tools, introducing the use of energetic factors associated with conformational changes and disorder to order transitions, as well as features calculated on structural ensembles. The descriptors are used to train and test a binding free energy model using a consensus of four machine learning algorithms, whose performance constitutes a significant improvement over the other state of the art empirical free energy functions tested.

21985277,A model-based circular binary segmentation algorithm for the analysis of array CGH data.,"<h4>Background</h4>Circular Binary Segmentation (CBS) is a permutation-based algorithm for array Comparative Genomic Hybridization (aCGH) data analysis. CBS accurately segments data by detecting change-points using a maximal-t test; but extensive computational burden is involved for evaluating the significance of change-points using permutations. A recent implementation utilizing a hybrid method and early stopping rules (hybrid CBS) to improve the performance in speed was subsequently proposed. However, a time analysis revealed that a major portion of computation time of the hybrid CBS was still spent on permutation. In addition, what the hybrid method provides is an approximation of the significance upper bound or lower bound, not an approximation of the significance of change-points itself.<h4>Results</h4>We developed a novel model-based algorithm, extreme-value based CBS (eCBS), which limits permutations and provides robust results without loss of accuracy. Thousands of aCGH data under null hypothesis were simulated in advance based on a variety of non-normal assumptions, and the corresponding maximal-t distribution was modeled by the Generalized Extreme Value (GEV) distribution. The modeling results, which associate characteristics of aCGH data to the GEV parameters, constitute lookup tables (eXtreme model). Using the eXtreme model, the significance of change-points could be evaluated in a constant time complexity through a table lookup process.<h4>Conclusions</h4>A novel algorithm, eCBS, was developed in this study. The current implementation of eCBS consistently outperforms the hybrid CBS 4� to 20� in computation time without loss of accuracy.

21988420,"Pain, analgesia and genetics.","<h4>Objectives</h4>In the clinical setting, there is marked intersubject variability in the intensity of pain reported by patients with apparently similar pain states, as well as widely differing analgesic dosing requirements between individuals to produce satisfactory pain relief with tolerable side-effects. Genetic and environmental factors as well as their interaction are implicated, and these are discussed in this review.<h4>Key findings</h4>Pioneering work undertaken in mice more than a decade ago, showed a strong genetic contribution to levels of nociception/hypersensitivity as well as levels of antinociception produced by commonly available analgesic agents. To date more than 300 candidate 'pain' genes have been identified as potentially contributing to heritable differences in pain sensitivity and analgesic responsiveness in animals and humans, with this information available in a publicly accessible database http://www.jbldesign.com/jmogil/enter.html. Since then, many genetic association studies have been conducted in humans to investigate the possibility that single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in an individual gene may explain drug inefficacy or excessive toxicity experienced by a small subset of the whole population who have the rare allele for a particular SNP.<h4>Summary</h4>Despite the fact that SNPs in more than 20 genes that affect pain sensitivity or contribute to interindividual variability in responses to analgesic medications have been identified in the human genome, much of the data is conflicting. Apart from deficiencies in the design and conduct of human genetic association studies, recent research from other fields has implicated epigenetic mechanisms that facilitate dynamic gene-environment communication, as a possible explanation.","kes, hji",0.0,0,0,2,0.0,,not about the resource
22014078,"Inputs to quality: supervision, management, and community involvement in health facilities in Egypt in 2004.","<h4>Background</h4>As low- and middle-income countries experience economic development, ensuring quality of health care delivery is a central component of health reform. Nevertheless, health reforms in low- and middle-income countries have focused more on access to services rather than the quality of these services, and reporting on quality has been limited. In the present study, we sought to examine the prevalence and regional variation in key management practices in Egyptian health facilities within three domains: supervision of the facility from the Ministry of Health and Population (MOHP), managerial processes, and patient and community involvement in care.<h4>Methods</h4>We conducted a cross-sectional analysis of data from 559 facilities surveyed with the Egyptian Service Provision Assessment (ESPA) survey in 2004, the most recent such survey in Egypt. We registered on the Measure Demographic and Health Survey (DHS) website http://legacy.measuredhs.com/login.cfm to gain access to the survey data. From the ESPA sampled 559 MOHP facilities, we excluded a total of 79 facilities because they did not offer facility-based 24-hour care or have at least one physician working in the facility, resulting in a final sample of 480 facilities. The final sample included 76 general service hospitals, 307 rural health units, and 97 maternal and child health and urban health units (MCH/urban units). We used standard frequency analyses to describe facility characteristics and tested the statistical significance of regional differences using chi-square statistics.<h4>Results</h4>Nearly all facilities reported having external supervision within the 6 months preceding the interview. In contrast, key facility-level managerial processes, such as having routine and documented management meetings and applying quality assurance approaches, were uncommon. Involvement of communities and patients was also reported in a minority of facilities. Hospitals and health units located in Urban Egypt compared with more rural parts of Egypt were significantly more likely to have management committees that met at least monthly, to keep official records of the meetings, and to have an approach for reviewing quality assurance activities.<h4>Conclusions</h4>Although the data precede the recent reform efforts of the MOHP, they provide a baseline against which future progress can be measured. Targeted efforts to improve facility-level management are critical to supporting quality improvement initiatives directed at improving the quality of health care throughout the country.","kes, hji",0.0,0,0,2,0.0,,

22161415,Surgical orbital decompression for thyroid eye disease.,"<h4>Background</h4>Orbital decompression is an established procedure for the management of exophthalmos and visual rehabilitation from optic neuropathy in cases of thyroid eye disease. Numerous procedures for removal of orbital bony wall, fat or a combination of these for a variety of indications in different stages of the disease have been well reported in the medical literature. However, the relative effectiveness and safety of these procedures in relation to the various indications remains unclear.<h4>Objectives</h4>To review current published evidence for the effectiveness of surgical orbital decompression for disfiguring proptosis in adult thyroid eye disease and summa rise information on possible complications and the quality of life from the studies identified.<h4>Search methods</h4>We searched CENTRAL (which contains the Cochrane Eyes and Vision Group Trials Register) (The Cochrane Library 2011, Issue 10), MEDLINE (January 1950 to October 2011), EMBASE (January 1980 to October 2011), the metaRegister of Controlled Trials (mRCT) (www.controlled-trials.com) and ClinicalTrials.gov (http://clinicaltrials.gov). There were no date or language restrictions in the electronic searches for trials. The electronic databases were last searched on 6 October 2011. We searched oculoplastic textbooks, conference proceedings from the European and American Society of Ophthalmic Plastic and Reconstructive Surgery (ESOPRS, ASOPRS), European Ophthalmological Society (SOE), the Association for Research in Vision and Ophthalmology (ARVO) and American Academy of Ophthalmology (AAO) for the years 2000 to 2009 to identify relevant data. We attempted to contact researchers who are active in this field for information about further published or unpublished studies.<h4>Selection criteria</h4>We included randomised controlled trials (RCTs) with no restriction on date or language comparing two or more surgical methods for orbital decompression with removal of bony wall, orbital fat or a combination of both for disfiguring proptosis or comparison of surgical techniques with any form of medical decompression.<h4>Data collection and analysis</h4>Each review author independently assessed study abstracts identified from the electronic and manual searches. Author analysis was then compared and full papers for appropriate studies were obtained according to the inclusion criteria. Disagreements between the authors were resolved by discussion.<h4>Main results</h4>We identified two randomised trials eligible for inclusion in the review. There was significant variability between the trials for interventions, methodology and outcome measures and therefore meta-analysis was not performed. One study suggested that the transantral approach and endoscopic transnasal technique had similar effects in reducing exophthalmos but that the endoscopic approach may be safer, relating to fewer complications. This study had short-term follow-up and lacked information on our primary outcome (success or failure of treatment). The second study provided evidence that intravenous steroids may be superior to primary surgical decompression in the management of compressive optic neuropathy requiring less secondary surgical procedures, although it relates more frequently to transient side effects. This study was weakened by a small sample size. Until more credible evidence is available recommendations as to best treatment cannot be reliably made.<h4>Authors' conclusions</h4>A single study showed that the transantral approach for orbital decompression was related to more complications than the endoscopic transnasal technique which is preferred by Ear, Nose and Throat (ENT) surgeons, usually as an adjunctive procedure. Intravenous steroids were reported in a single trial to be the most efficient intervention for dysthyroid optic neuropathy. The majority of published literature on orbital decompression for thyroid eye disease consists of retrospective, cohort, or case series studies. Although these provide useful descriptive information, clarification is required to show the relative effectiveness of each intervention for various indications.The two RCTs reviewed are not robust enough to provide credible evidence to our understanding of current decompressive surgery and to support recommendations for clinical practice. There is evidence from currently available uncontrolled studies that removal of the medial and lateral wall (balanced decompression) with or without fat removal may be the most effective surgical method related to only a few complications.There is a clear need for randomised studies evaluating the balanced two-wall, three-wall and orbital fat decompression techniques. Comparison with other surgical techniques for orbital decompression or with immunosuppression in cases of compressive optic neuropathy would also be important. These studies should primarily address the reduction of exophthalmos, disease severity, complication rates, quality of life and cost of the intervention.","kes, hji",0.0,0,0,2,0.0,,

The variants are interpreted by interrogating data compiled from 15 constantly updated sources. In addition to detailed functional characterization of the coding variants, AnnTools searches for overlaps with regulatory elements, disease/trait associated loci, known segmental duplications and artifact prone regions, thereby offering an integrated and comprehensive analysis of genomic data. The tool conveniently accepts user-provided tracks for custom annotation and offers flexibility in input data formats. The output is generated in the universal Variant Call Format. High annotation speed makes AnnTools suitable for high-throughput sequencing facilities, while a low-memory footprint and modest CPU requirements allow it to operate on a personal computer. The application is freely available for public use; the package includes installation scripts and a set of helper tools.<h4>Availability</h4>http://anntools.sourceforge.net/.<h4>Supplementary information</h4>Supplementary data are available at Bioinformatics online.","kes, hji",0.0,0,0,2,0.0,,
22280360,The EnzymeTracker: an open-source laboratory information management system for sample tracking.,"<h4>Background</h4>In many laboratories, researchers store experimental data on their own workstation using spreadsheets. However, this approach poses a number of problems, ranging from sharing issues to inefficient data-mining. Standard spreadsheets are also error-prone, as data do not undergo any validation process. To overcome spreadsheets inherent limitations, a number of proprietary systems have been developed, which laboratories need to pay expensive license fees for. Those costs are usually prohibitive for most laboratories and prevent scientists from benefiting from more sophisticated data management systems.<h4>Results</h4>In this paper, we propose the EnzymeTracker, a web-based laboratory information management system for sample tracking, as an open-source and flexible alternative that aims at facilitating entry, mining and sharing of experimental biological data. The EnzymeTracker features online spreadsheets and tools for monitoring numerous experiments conducted by several collaborators to identify and characterize samples. It also provides libraries of shared data such as protocols, and administration tools for data access control using OpenID and user/team management. Our system relies on a database management system for efficient data indexing and management and a user-friendly AJAX interface that can be accessed over the Internet. The EnzymeTracker facilitates data entry by dynamically suggesting entries and providing smart data-mining tools to effectively retrieve data. Our system features a number of tools to visualize and annotate experimental data, and export highly customizable reports. It also supports QR matrix barcoding to facilitate sample tracking.<h4>Conclusions</h4>The EnzymeTracker was designed to be easy to use and offers many benefits over spreadsheets, thus presenting the characteristics required to facilitate acceptance by the scientific community. It has been successfully used for 20 months on a daily basis by over 50 scientists. The EnzymeTracker is freely available online at http://cubique.fungalgenomics.ca/enzymedb/index.html under the GNU GPLv3 license.","kes, hji",0.0,0,0,2,0.0,,
22417303,Infrequent p53 gene mutation but UV gradient-like p53 protein positivity in keloids.,"Keloids are characterized by extreme fibroblastic overgrowth of unknown pathogenesis after skin injury. Previous studies, mostly in non-Caucasian populations, suggest that p53 mutations may be involved. To substantiate this, we performed DNA sequence analysis of exons 4-8 of the p53 gene and immunohistochemical staining of p53 protein in archived keloidal tissue samples from 23 Caucasian patients. In contrast to previous reports, we found mutated p53 in keloidal tissue in a minority of cases (2/23; 12%). The G allele frequency and C allele frequency at the p53 polymorphic codon 72 were 0.72 (33/46) and 0.28 (13/46), respectively, in our study, a finding that was similar to the 0.77 (184/240) vs. 0.23 (56/240) (P = 0.4580; chi-squared test) observed in the Hap Map data of a European population but statistically significantly different from the 0.43 (547/1258) vs. 0.57 (711/1258) (P = 0.0002; chi-squared test) observed in the 1000 Genome project [Database of Single Nucleotide Polymorphisms (dbSNP). Bethesda (MD): National Center for Biotechnology Information, National Library of Medicine. dbSNP accession:rs1042522, (dbSNP Build ID: 132). Available from: (http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/SNP/] a difference most likely due to the different genetic background of the populations enrolled. However, one-third of the keloidal samples showed lesional nuclear p53 staining with a UV penetration gradient-like positivity (P = 0.0084). Staining with an anti-cyclobutane pyrimidine dimer antibody revealed the total absence of short-term photoproducts in the epidermis as well as keloidal tissue. Furthermore, all fibroblasts expressing p53 stained negative for Ki-67, indicating that these cells were in a quiescent stage and p53 upregulation did not contribute to keloidal proliferation. We conclude that p53 plays no major role in the pathogenesis of keloids in the Caucasian population.","kes, hji",0.0,0,0,2,0.0,,references other data resource

22434533,Sann: solvent accessibility prediction of proteins by nearest neighbor method.,"We present a method to predict the solvent accessibility of proteins which is based on a nearest neighbor method applied to the sequence profiles. Using the method, continuous real-value prediction as well as two-state and three-state discrete predictions can be obtained. The method utilizes the z-score value of the distance measure in the feature vector space to estimate the relative contribution among the k-nearest neighbors for prediction of the discrete and continuous solvent accessibility. The Solvent accessibility database is constructed from 5717 proteins extracted from PISCES culling server with the cutoff of 25% sequence identities. Using optimal parameters, the prediction accuracies (for discrete predictions) of 78.38% (two-state prediction with the threshold of 25%), 65.1% (three-state prediction with the thresholds of 9 and 36%), and the Pearson correlation coefficient (between the predicted and true RSA's for continuous prediction) of 0.676 are achieved An independent benchmark test was performed with the CASP8 targets where we find that the proposed method outperforms existing methods. The prediction accuracies are 80.89% (for two state prediction with the threshold of 25%), 67.58% (three-state prediction), and the Pearson correlation coefficient of 0.727 (for continuous prediction) with mean absolute error of 0.148. We have also investigated the effect of increasing database sizes on the prediction accuracy, where additional improvement in the accuracy is observed as the database size increases.

22435961,Healthcare continuity from hospital to territory in Lombardy: TELEMACO project.,"<h4>Objectives</h4>To verify implementation and use of TELEMACO (TELEMedicina Ai piccoli COmunilombardi; http://www.telemaco.regione.lombardia.it/), which provides specialized continuity of care with innovative healthcare services in remote areas of the Lombardy region of Italy; to design a network in the territory for sharing of continuityof- care programs; and to allow the relevant health authorities to collect cost data to establish a model for sustainable pricing for implementing these services.<h4>Methods</h4>TELEMACO provides home-based telemanagement services for patients with chronic heart failure and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), as well as second-opinion teleconsultations in cardiology, dermatology, diabetology, and pulmonology for general practitioners and second-opinion teleconsultations on digital images in cases of traumatic brain injury and stroke. A total of 2 service centers, 10 cardiology and pneumology departments, 30 specialists, 176 general practitioners, 40 nurses, 2 emergency departments, and 2 consultant hospitals were involved.<h4>Results</h4>A total of 166 patients with chronic heart failure and 474 patients with COPD were enrolled. There were 4830, 51, and 44 second-opinion teleconsultations for cardiologic, dermatologic, and diabetic conditions, respectively. There were 147 second-opinion teleconsultations on digital images, 68 for stroke, and 79 for traumatic brain injury. Implementation of TELEMACO introduced innovations in working methods and provided evidence to the health authorities for allocating funds for such services.<h4>Conclusions</h4>TELEMACO provided evidence that there is a growing need for home management of patients using telemedicine, a common and efficacious approach that can ensure care continuity, especially in chronic diseases.","kes, hji",0.0,0,0,2,0.0,,
22454131,Revealing mammalian evolutionary relationships by comparative analysis of gene clusters.,"Many software tools for comparative analysis of genomic sequence data have been released in recent decades. Despite this, it remains challenging to determine evolutionary relationships in gene clusters due to their complex histories involving duplications, deletions, inversions, and conversions. One concept describing these relationships is orthology. Orthologs derive from a common ancestor by speciation, in contrast to paralogs, which derive from duplication. Discriminating orthologs from paralogs is a necessary step in most multispecies sequence analyses, but doing so accurately is impeded by the occurrence of gene conversion events. We propose a refined method of orthology assignment based on two paradigms for interpreting its definition: by genomic context or by sequence content. X-orthology (based on context) traces orthology resulting from speciation and duplication only, while N-orthology (based on content) includes the influence of conversion events. We developed a computational method for automatically mapping both types of orthology on a per-nucleotide basis in gene cluster regions studied by comparative sequencing, and we make this mapping accessible by visualizing the output. All of these steps are incorporated into our newly extended CHAP 2 package. We evaluate our method using both simulated data and real gene clusters (including the well-characterized a-globin and �-globin clusters). We also illustrate use of CHAP 2 by analyzing four more loci: CCL (chemokine ligand), IFN (interferon), CYP2abf (part of cytochrome P450 family 2), and KIR (killer cell immunoglobulin-like receptors). These new methods facilitate and extend our understanding of evolution at these and other loci by adding automated accurate evolutionary inference to the biologist's toolkit.

22479706,Network-based functional enrichment.,"<h4>Background</h4>Many methods have been developed to infer and reason about molecular interaction networks. These approaches often yield networks with hundreds or thousands of nodes and up to an order of magnitude more edges. It is often desirable to summarize the biological information in such networks. A very common approach is to use gene function enrichment analysis for this task. A major drawback of this method is that it ignores information about the edges in the network being analyzed, i.e., it treats the network simply as a set of genes. In this paper, we introduce a novel method for functional enrichment that explicitly takes network interactions into account.<h4>Results</h4>Our approach naturally generalizes Fisher's exact test, a gene set-based technique. Given a function of interest, we compute the subgraph of the network induced by genes annotated to this function. We use the sequence of sizes of the connected components of this sub-network to estimate its connectivity. We estimate the statistical significance of the connectivity empirically by a permutation test. We present three applications of our method: i) determine which functions are enriched in a given network, ii) given a network and an interesting subnetwork of genes within that network, determine which functions are enriched in the sub-network, and iii) given two networks, determine the functions for which the connectivity improves when we merge the second network into the first. Through these applications, we show that our approach is a natural alternative to network clustering algorithms.<h4>Conclusions</h4>We presented a novel approach to functional enrichment that takes into account the pairwise relationships among genes annotated by a particular function. Each of the three applications discovers highly relevant functions. We used our methods to study biological data from three different organisms. Our results demonstrate the wide applicability of our methods. Our algorithms are implemented in C++ and are freely available under the GNU General Public License at our supplementary website.

22638579,SteinerNet: a web server for integrating 'omic' data to discover hidden components of response pathways.,"High-throughput technologies including transcriptional profiling, proteomics and reverse genetics screens provide detailed molecular descriptions of cellular responses to perturbations. However, it is difficult to integrate these diverse data to reconstruct biologically meaningful signaling networks. Previously, we have established a framework for integrating transcriptional, proteomic and interactome data by searching for the solution to the prize-collecting Steiner tree problem. Here, we present a web server, SteinerNet, to make this method available in a user-friendly format for a broad range of users with data from any species. At a minimum, a user only needs to provide a set of experimentally detected proteins and/or genes and the server will search for connections among these data from the provided interactomes for yeast, human, mouse, Drosophila melanogaster and Caenorhabditis elegans. More advanced users can upload their own interactome data as well. The server provides interactive visualization of the resulting optimal network and downloadable files detailing the analysis and results. We believe that SteinerNet will be useful for researchers who would like to integrate their high-throughput data for a specific condition or cellular response and to find biologically meaningful pathways.

This technical concern introduces biases that hamper any synthetic studies or comparison of genetic diversity between collections. To prevent this for Sorghum bicolor, we developed a control kit of 48 SSR markers.<h4>Methods and results</h4>One hundred seventeen markers were selected along the genome to provide coverage across the length of all 10 sorghum linkage groups. They were tested for polymorphism and reproducibility across two laboratories (Centre de Cooperation Internationale en Recherche Agronomique pour le Developpement [CIRAD], France, and International Crops Research Institute for the Semi-Arid Tropics [ICRISAT], India) using two commonly used genotyping technologies (polyacrylamide gel-based technology with LI-COR sequencing machines and capillary systems with ABI sequencing apparatus) with DNA samples from a diverse set of 48 S. bicolor accessions.<h4>Conclusions</h4>A kit for diversity analysis (http://sat.cirad.fr/sat/sorghum_SSR_kit/) was developed. It contains information on 48 technically robust sorghum microsatellite markers and 10 DNA controls. It can further be used to calibrate sorghum SSR genotyping data acquired with different technologies and compare those to genetic diversity references.","kes, hji",0.0,0,0,2,0.0,,
22645320,Integrative analysis of gene and miRNA expression profiles with transcription factor-miRNA feed-forward loops identifies regulators in human cancers.,"We describe here a novel method for integrating gene and miRNA expression profiles in cancer using feed-forward loops (FFLs) consisting of transcription factors (TFs), miRNAs and their common target genes. The dChip-GemiNI (Gene and miRNA Network-based Integration) method statistically ranks computationally predicted FFLs by their explanatory power to account for differential gene and miRNA expression between two biological conditions such as normal and cancer. GemiNI integrates not only gene and miRNA expression data but also computationally derived information about TF-target gene and miRNA-mRNA interactions. Literature validation shows that the integrated modeling of expression data and FFLs better identifies cancer-related TFs and miRNAs compared to existing approaches. We have utilized GemiNI for analyzing six data sets of solid cancers (liver, kidney, prostate, lung and germ cell) and found that top-ranked FFLs account for ~20% of transcriptome changes between normal and cancer. We have identified common FFL regulators across multiple cancer types, such as known FFLs consisting of MYC and miR-15/miR-17 families, and novel FFLs consisting of ARNT, CREB1 and their miRNA partners.

22672126,"Trends in midwife-attended births in the United States, 1989-2009.","<h4>Introduction</h4>Data on attendance at birth by midwives in the United States have been available on the national level since 1989. Rates of certified nurse-midwife (CNM)-attended births more than doubled between 1989 (3.3% of all births) and 2002 (7.7%) and have remained steady since. This article examines trends in midwife-attended births from 1989 to 2009.<h4>Methods</h4>The data in this report are based on records gathered as part of the US National Standard Certificate of Live Birth from a public use Web site, Vital Stats (http://www.cdc.gov/nchs/VitalStats.htm), that allows users to create and download specialized tables.<h4>Results</h4>Between 2007 and 2009, the proportion of all births attended by CNMs increased by 4% from 7.3% of all births to 7.6% and a total of 313,516. This represents a decline in total births attended by CNMs from 2008 but a higher proportion of all births because total US births dropped at a faster rate. The proportion of vaginal births attended by CNMs reached an all-time high of 11.4% in 2009. There were strong regional patterns to the distribution of CNM-attended births. Births attended by """"other midwives"""" rose to 21,787 or 0.5% of all US births, and the total proportion of all births attended by midwives reached an all-time high of 8.1%. The race/ethnicity of mothers attended by CNMs has shifted over the years. In 1990, CNMs attended a disproportionately high number of births to non-white mothers, whereas in 2009, the profile of CNM births mirrors the national distribution in race/ethnicity.<h4>Discussion</h4>Midwife-attended births in the United States are increasing. The geographic patterns in the distribution of midwife-attended births warrant further study.","kes, hji",0.0,0,0,2,0.0,,

High-resolution spatiotemporal electrical mapping has become an important advance for investigating gastrointestinal electrical behaviors in health and motility disorders. However, research progress has been constrained by the low efficiency of the data analysis tasks. This work introduces a new efficient software package: GEMS (Gastrointestinal Electrical Mapping Suite), for analyzing and visualizing high-resolution multi-electrode gastrointestinal mapping data in spatiotemporal detail.<h4>Results</h4>GEMS incorporates a number of new and previously validated automated analytical and visualization methods into a coherent framework coupled to an intuitive and user-friendly graphical user interface. GEMS is implemented using MATLAB�, which combines sophisticated mathematical operations and GUI compatibility. Recorded slow wave data can be filtered via a range of inbuilt techniques, efficiently analyzed via automated event-detection and cycle clustering algorithms, and high quality isochronal activation maps, velocity field maps, amplitude maps, frequency (time interval) maps and data animations can be rapidly generated. Normal and dysrhythmic activities can be analyzed, including initiation and conduction abnormalities. The software is distributed free to academics via a community user website and forum (http://sites.google.com/site/gimappingsuite).<h4>Conclusions</h4>This software allows for the rapid analysis and generation of critical results from gastrointestinal high-resolution electrical mapping data, including quantitative analysis and graphical outputs for qualitative analysis. The software is designed to be used by non-experts in data and signal processing, and is intended to be used by clinical researchers as well as physiologists and bioengineers. The use and distribution of this software package will greatly accelerate efforts to improve the understanding of the causes and clinical consequences of gastrointestinal electrical disorders, through high-resolution electrical mapping.","kes, hji",0.0,0,0,2,0.0,,
22689643,MoNetFamily: a web server to infer homologous modules and module-module interaction networks in vertebrates.,"A module is a fundamental unit forming with highly connected proteins and performs a certain kind of biological functions. Modules and module-module interaction (MMI) network are essential for understanding cellular processes and functions. The MoNetFamily web server can identify the modules, homologous modules (called module family) and MMI networks across multiple species for the query protein(s). This server first finds module candidates of the query by using BLASTP to search the module template database (1785 experimental and 1252 structural templates). MoNetFamily then infers the homologous modules of the selected module candidate using protein-protein interaction (PPI) families. According to homologous modules and PPIs, we statistically calculated MMIs and MMI networks across multiple species. For each module candidate, MoNetFamily identifies its neighboring modules and their MMIs in module networks of Homo sapiens, Mus musculus and Danio rerio. Finally, MoNetFamily shows the conserved proteins, PPI profiles and functional annotations of the module family. Our results indicate that the server can be useful for MMI network (e.g. 1818 modules and 9678 MMIs in H. sapiens) visualizations and query annotations using module families and neighboring modules. We believe that the server is able to provide valuable insights to determine homologous modules and MMI networks across multiple species for studying module evolution and cellular processes.

Given these limitations, development of a method that can bin vast amounts of metagenomic sequence data in a rapid, efficient and computationally inexpensive manner can profoundly influence metagenomic analysis in computational resource poor settings. We introduce TWARIT, a hybrid binning algorithm, that employs a combination of short-read alignment and composition-based signature sorting approaches to achieve rapid binning rates without compromising on binning accuracy and specificity. TWARIT is validated with simulated and real-world metagenomes and the results demonstrate significantly lower overall binning times compared to that of existing methods.

In this work, we propose a new framework for the detection of fusion transcripts through short paired-end reads which integrates splicing-driven alignment and abundance estimation analysis, producing a more accurate set of reads supporting the junction discovery and taking into account also not annotated transcripts. Bellerophontes performs a selection of putative junctions on the basis of a match to an accurate gene fusion model.<h4>Results</h4>We report the fusion genes discovered by the proposed framework on experimentally validated biological samples of chronic myelogenous leukemia (CML) and on public NCBI datasets, for which Bellerophontes is able to detect the exact junction sequence. With respect to state-of-art approaches, Bellerophontes detects the same experimentally validated fusions, however, it is more selective on the total number of detected fusions and provides a more accurate set of spanning reads supporting the junctions. We finally report the fusions involving non-annotated transcripts found in CML samples.<h4>Availability and implementation</h4>Bellerophontes JAVA/Perl/Bash software implementation is free and available at http://eda.polito.it/bellerophontes/.","kes, hji",0.0,0,0,2,0.0,,

Structural genomic projects are beginning to produce protein structures with unknown functions. Therefore, efficient methods are required if all these structures are to be properly annotated. Lots of methods for finding binding sites involve 3D structure comparison. Here we design a method to find protein binding sites by direct comparison of protein 3D structures.<h4>Results</h4>We have developed an efficient heuristic approach for finding similar binding sites from the surface of given proteins. Our approach consists of three steps: local sequence alignment, protein surface detection, and 3D structures comparison. We implement the algorithm and produce a software package that works well in practice. When comparing a complete protein with all complete protein structures in the PDB database, experiments show that the average recall value of our approach is 82% and the average precision value of our approach is also significantly better than the existing approaches.<h4>Conclusions</h4>Our program has much higher recall values than those existing programs. Experiments show that all the existing approaches have recall values less than 50%. This implies that more than 50% of real binding sites cannot be reported by those existing approaches.

22848493,"qPMS7: a fast algorithm for finding (ℓ, d)-motifs in DNA and protein sequences.","Detection of rare events happening in a set of DNA/protein sequences could lead to new biological discoveries. One kind of such rare events is the presence of patterns called motifs in DNA/protein sequences. Finding motifs is a challenging problem since the general version of motif search has been proven to be intractable. Motifs discovery is an important problem in biology. For example, it is useful in the detection of transcription factor binding sites and transcriptional regulatory elements that are very crucial in understanding gene function, human disease, drug design, etc. Many versions of the motif search problem have been proposed in the literature. One such is the (l, d)-motif search (or Planted Motif Search (PMS)). A generalized version of the PMS problem, namely, Quorum Planted Motif Search (qPMS), is shown to accurately model motifs in real data. However, solving the qPMS problem is an extremely difficult task because a special case of it, the PMS Problem, is already NP-hard, which means that any algorithm solving it can be expected to take exponential time in the worse case scenario. In this paper, we propose a novel algorithm named qPMS7 that tackles the qPMS problem on real data as well as challenging instances. Experimental results show that our Algorithm qPMS7 is on an average 5 times faster than the state-of-art algorithm. The executable program of Algorithm qPMS7 is freely available on the web at http://pms.engr.uconn.edu/downloads/qPMS7.zip. Our online motif discovery tools that use Algorithm qPMS7 are freely available at http://pms.engr.uconn.edu or http://motifsearch.com.","kes, hji",0.0,0,0,2,0.0,,
22861649,A re-evaluation of 9-HODE activity at TRPV1 channels in comparison with anandamide: enantioselectivity and effects at other TRP channels and in sensory neurons.,"<h4>Background and purpose</h4>Two oxidation products of linoleic acid, 9- and 13-hydroxy-octadecadienoic acids (HODEs), have recently been suggested to act as endovanilloids, that is, endogenous agonists of transient receptor potential vanilloid-1 (TRPV1) channels, thereby contributing to inflammatory hyperalgesia in rats. However, HODE activity at rat TRPV1 in comparison with the best established endovanilloid, anandamide, and its enantioselectivity and selectivity towards other TRP channels that are also abundant in sensory neurons have never been investigated.<h4>Experimental approach</h4>We studied the effect of 9(R)-HODE, 9(S)-HODE, (+/-)13-HODE, 15(S)-hydroxyanandamide and anandamide on [Ca(2+) ](i)  in HEK-293 cells stably expressing the rat or human recombinant TRPV1, or rat recombinant TRPV2, TRPA1 or TRPM8, and also the effect of 9(S)-HODE in rat dorsal root ganglion (DRG) neurons by calcium imaging.<h4>Key results</h4>Anandamide and 15(S)-hydroxyanandamide were the most potent endovanilloids at human TRPV1, whereas 9(S)-HODE was approximately threefold less efficacious and 75- and 3-fold less potent, respectively, and did not perform much better at rat TRPV1. The 9(R)-HODE and (+/-)13-HODE were almost inactive at TRPV1. Unlike anandamide and 15(S)-hydroxyanandamide, all HODEs were very weak at desensitizing TRPV1 to the action of capsaicin, but activated rat TRPV2 [only (+/-)13-HODE] and rat TRPA1, and antagonized rat TRPM8, at concentrations higher than those required to activate TRPV1. Finally, 9(S)-HODE elevated [Ca(2+) ](i)  in DRG neurons almost exclusively in capsaicin-sensitive cells but only at concentrations between 25 and 100 �M.<h4>Conclusions and implications</h4>The present data suggest that HODEs are less important endovanilloids than anandamide.<h4>Linked articles</h4>This article is part of a themed section on Cannabinoids.

22915736,Plant B vitamin pathways and their compartmentation: a guide for the perplexed.,"The B vitamins and the cofactors derived from them are essential for life. B vitamin synthesis in plants is consequently as crucial to plants themselves as it is to humans and animals, whose B vitamin nutrition depends largely on plants. The synthesis and salvage pathways for the seven plant B vitamins are now broadly known, but certain enzymes and many transporters have yet to be identified, and the subcellular locations of various reactions are unclear. Although very substantial, what is not known about plant B vitamin pathways is regrettably difficult to discern from the literature or from biochemical pathway databases. Nor do databases accurately represent all that is known about B vitamin pathways-above all their compartmentation-because the facts are scattered throughout the literature, and thus hard to piece together. These problems (i) deter discoveries because newcomers to B vitamins cannot see which mysteries still need solving; and (ii) impede metabolic reconstruction and modelling of B vitamin pathways because genes for reactions or transport steps are missing. This review therefore takes a fresh approach to capture current knowledge of B vitamin pathways in plants. The synthesis pathways, key salvage routes, and their subcellular compartmentation are surveyed in depth, and encoded in the SEED database (http://pubseed.theseed.org/seedviewer.cgi?page=PlantGateway) for Arabidopsis and maize. The review itself and the encoded pathways specifically identify enigmatic or missing reactions, enzymes, and transporters. The SEED-encoded B vitamin pathway collection is a publicly available, expertly curated, one-stop resource for metabolic reconstruction and modeling.","kes, hji",0.0,0,0,2,0.0,,

The exact characterization of such aberrations remains a challenge despite the availability of increasing amount of data, from SNParray to next-generation sequencing. Furthermore, genomic aberrations in cancer are especially difficult to handle because they are, by nature, unique to the patients. However, their recurrence in specific regions of the genome has been shown to reflect their relevance in the development of tumors. GREVE makes use of previously characterized events to identify such regions and focus any further analysis.<h4>Availability</h4>GREVE is available through a web interface and open-source application (http://www.well.ox.ac.uk/GREVE).","kes, hji",0.0,0,0,2,0.0,,
22998891,Patterns of medication initiation in newly diagnosed diabetes mellitus: quality and cost implications.,"Currently, 25 million Americans are known to have diabetes, with an additional 7 million cases believed to be undiagnosed. It is estimated that direct and indirect costs of diabetes top $200 billion. Due to the significant health and financial burdens associated with diabetes, it is imperative that this disease be treated quickly and aggressively. In 2009, the American Diabetes Association and the European Association for the Study of Diabetes developed a consensus statement regarding the treatment of type 2 diabetes, citing lifestyle modification and metformin as the preferred first line therapies. In this study, the authors looked at prescription claims data for adults who were newly initiated on oral hypoglycemic monotherapy between January 1, 2006, and December 31, 2008, to determine if initiation patterns changed over time, to evaluate how well the treatment guidelines were being followed, and to assess the economic consequences of prescribing patterns by drug class for both patients and insurers. The results showed that over the course of the study period the proportion of patients initially treated with metformin increased, whereas those receiving sulfonylureas as first-line therapy decreased. Thiazolidinediones experienced the greatest decrease, falling from 20% to 8%, while prescriptions for dipeptidyl peptidase-4 inhibitors increase from 0-7%. Over a 6-month period, patients taking metformin or sulfonylureas paid approximately $38 to $40 in co-pays while insurance paid about $77. Patients taking other agents paid approximately $130 in co-pays and insurance paid over $500. The authors concluded that based its cost and safety profile, metformin should be the first line drug therapy for patients with newly diagnosed type 2 diabetes.

The former option is a basic one and applicable only to full-length sequences, whereas the latter option is applicable even when the unaligned sequences are short and fragmentary. These methods internally infer the phylogenetic relationship among the sequences in the existing alignment and the phylogenetic positions of unaligned sequences. Benchmarks based on two independent simulations consistently suggest that the """"--addfragments"""" option outperforms recent methods, PaPaRa and PAGAN, in accuracy for difficult problems and that these three methods appropriately handle easy problems.<h4>Availability</h4>http://mafft.cbrc.jp/alignment/software/<h4>Contact</h4>katoh@ifrec.osaka-u.ac.jp<h4>Supplementary information</h4>Supplementary data are available at Bioinformatics online.","kes, hji",0.0,0,0,2,0.0,,

As the population ages and healthcare demands increase, providers are consulting palliative care (PC). Nurse practitioners (NPs) should understand when to consult PC.<h4>Data sources</h4>Information was obtained from an extensive search of the scientific literature to include Pallimed (http://www.pallimed.org/) and the author's clinical experience.<h4>Conclusions</h4>Based on the 2009 Clinical Practice Guidelines for Quality PC developed from the Hospice and PC Coalition, PC should be consulted at diagnosis. These findings have also been validated in a landmark randomized controlled trial by Temel et al. (2010). The goals of PC are to alleviate suffering and promote quality of life for people with illnesses. PC accepts and incorporates hospice philosophies, but is distinct.<h4>Implications for practice</h4>Many professional organizations are incorporating PC into their specialties and guidelines. In addition to incorporating PC at diagnosis, PC access needs to be improved. New and experienced NPs may appreciate collaborating with PC specialists. Such conversations and relationships will likely offer practical and supportive guidance to both patients and NPs. Overall, the future for PC is promising.","kes, hji",0.0,0,0,2,0.0,,clinical
23118487,CellLineNavigator: a workbench for cancer cell line analysis.,"The CellLineNavigator database, freely available at http://www.medicalgenomics.org/celllinenavigator, is a web-based workbench for large scale comparisons of a large collection of diverse cell lines. It aims to support experimental design in the fields of genomics, systems biology and translational biomedical research. Currently, this compendium holds genome wide expression profiles of 317 different cancer cell lines, categorized into 57 different pathological states and 28 individual tissues. To enlarge the scope of CellLineNavigator, the database was furthermore closely linked to commonly used bioinformatics databases and knowledge repositories. To ensure easy data access and search ability, a simple data and an intuitive querying interface were implemented. It allows the user to explore and filter gene expression, focusing on pathological or physiological conditions. For a more complex search, the advanced query interface may be used to query for (i) differentially expressed genes; (ii) pathological or physiological conditions; or (iii) gene names or functional attributes, such as Kyoto Encyclopaedia of Genes and Genomes pathway maps. These queries may also be combined.

UROD has potential to modulate tumor response of radiotherapy for head and neck cancer, and EGFR and Her2 are common drug targets for the treatment of head and neck cancer. This study attempts to find a possible lead compound backbone from TCM Database@Taiwan ( http://tcm.cmu.edu.tw/ ) for EGFR, Her2, and UROD proteins against head and neck cancer using computational techniques. Possible traditional Chinese medicine (TCM) lead compounds had potential binding affinities with EGFR, Her2, and UROD proteins. The candidates formed stable interactions with residues Arg803, Thr854 in EGFR, residues Thr862, Asp863 in Her2 protein, and residues Arg37, Arg41 in UROD protein, which are key residues in the binding or catalytic domain of EGFR, Her2, and UROD proteins. Thus, the TCM candidates indicated a possible molecule backbone for evolving potential inhibitors for three drug target proteins against head and neck cancer.","kes, hji",0.0,0,0,2,0.0,,
23153250,"MTMDAT-HADDOCK: high-throughput, protein complex structure modeling based on limited proteolysis and mass spectrometry.","<h4>Background</h4>MTMDAT is a program designed to facilitate analysis of mass spectrometry data of proteins and biomolecular complexes that are probed structurally by limited proteolysis. This approach can provide information about stable fragments of multidomain proteins, yield tertiary and quaternary structure data, and help determine the origin of stability changes at the amino acid residue level. Here, we introduce a pipeline between MTMDAT and HADDOCK, that facilitates protein-protein complex structure probing in a high-throughput and highly automated fashion.<h4>Results</h4>A new feature of MTMDAT allows for the direct identification of residues that are involved in complex formation by comparing the mass spectra of bound and unbound proteins after proteolysis. If 3D structures of the unbound components are available, this data can be used to define restraints for data-driven docking to calculate a model of the complex. We describe here a new implementation of MTMDAT, which includes a pipeline to the data-driven docking program HADDOCK, thus streamlining the entire procedure. This addition, together with usability improvements in MTMDAT, enables high-throughput modeling of protein complexes from mass spectrometry data. The algorithm has been validated by using the protein-protein interaction between the ubiquitin-binding domain of proteasome component Rpn13 and ubiquitin. The resulting structural model, based on restraints extracted by MTMDAT from limited proteolysis and modeled by HADDOCK, was compared to the published NMR structure, which relied on twelve unambiguous intermolecular NOE interactions. The MTMDAT-HADDOCK structure was of similar quality to structures generated using only chemical shift perturbation data derived by NMR titration experiments.<h4>Conclusions</h4>The new MTMDAT-HADDOCK pipeline enables direct high-throughput modeling of protein complexes from mass spectrometry data.

23192052,Hierarchical shrinkage priors and model fitting for high-dimensional generalized linear models.,"Abstract     Genetic and other scientific studies routinely generate very many predictor variables, which can be naturally grouped, with predictors in the same groups being highly correlated. It is desirable to incorporate the hierarchical structure of the predictor variables into generalized linear models for simultaneous variable selection and coefficient estimation. We propose two prior distributions: hierarchical Cauchy and double-exponential distributions, on coefficients in generalized linear models. The hierarchical priors include both variable-specific and group-specific tuning parameters, thereby not only adopting different shrinkage for different coefficients and different groups but also providing a way to pool the information within groups. We fit generalized linear models with the proposed hierarchical priors by incorporating flexible expectation-maximization (EM) algorithms into the standard iteratively weighted least squares as implemented in the general statistical package R. The methods are illustrated with data from an experiment to identify genetic polymorphisms for survival of mice following infection with Listeria monocytogenes. The performance of the proposed procedures is further assessed via simulation studies. The methods are implemented in a freely available R package BhGLM (http://www.ssg.uab.edu/bhglm/).","kes, hji",0.0,0,0,2,0.0,,
23217202,Protein Nano-Object Integrator (ProNOI) for generating atomic style objects for molecular modeling.,"<h4>Background</h4>With the progress of nanotechnology, one frequently has to model biological macromolecules simultaneously with nano-objects. However, the atomic structures of the nano objects are typically not available or they are solid state entities. Because of that, the researchers have to investigate such nano systems by generating models of the nano objects in a manner that the existing software be able to carry the simulations. In addition, it should allow generating composite objects with complex shape by combining basic geometrical figures and embedding biological macromolecules within the system.<h4>Results</h4>Here we report the Protein Nano-Object Integrator (ProNOI) which allows for generating atomic-style geometrical objects with user desired shape and dimensions. Unlimited number of objects can be created and combined with biological macromolecules in Protein Data Bank (PDB) format file. Once the objects are generated, the users can use sliders to manipulate their shape, dimension and absolute position. In addition, the software offers the option to charge the objects with either specified surface or volumetric charge density and to model them with user-desired dielectric constants. According to the user preference, the biological macromolecule atoms can be assigned charges and radii according to four different force fields: Amber, Charmm, OPLS and PARSE. The biological macromolecules and the atomic-style objects are exported as a position, charge and radius (PQR) file, or if a default dielectric constant distribution is not selected, it is exported as a position, charge, radius and epsilon (PQRE) file. As illustration of the capabilities of the ProNOI, we created a composite object in a shape of a robot, aptly named the Clemson Robot, whose parts are charged with various volumetric charge densities and holds the barnase-barstar protein complex in its hand.<h4>Conclusions</h4>The Protein Nano-Object Integrator (ProNOI) is a convenient tool for generating atomic-style nano shapes in conjunction with biological macromolecule(s). Charges and radii on the macromolecule atoms and the atoms in the shapes are assigned according to the user's preferences allowing various scenarios of modeling.

23271269,Inference of gene regulatory networks from genome-wide knockout fitness data.,"<h4>Motivation</h4>Genome-wide fitness is an emerging type of high-throughput biological data generated for individual organisms by creating libraries of knockouts, subjecting them to broad ranges of environmental conditions, and measuring the resulting clone-specific fitnesses. Since fitness is an organism-scale measure of gene regulatory network behaviour, it may offer certain advantages when insights into such phenotypical and functional features are of primary interest over individual gene expression. Previous works have shown that genome-wide fitness data can be used to uncover novel gene regulatory interactions, when compared with results of more conventional gene expression analysis. Yet, to date, few algorithms have been proposed for systematically using genome-wide mutant fitness data for gene regulatory network inference.<h4>Results</h4>In this article, we describe a model and propose an inference algorithm for using fitness data from knockout libraries to identify underlying gene regulatory networks. Unlike most prior methods, the presented approach captures not only structural, but also dynamical and non-linear nature of biomolecular systems involved. A state-space model with non-linear basis is used for dynamically describing gene regulatory networks. Network structure is then elucidated by estimating unknown model parameters. Unscented Kalman filter is used to cope with the non-linearities introduced in the model, which also enables the algorithm to run in on-line mode for practical use. Here, we demonstrate that the algorithm provides satisfying results for both synthetic data as well as empirical measurements of GAL network in yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae and TyrR-LiuR network in bacteria Shewanella oneidensis.<h4>Availability</h4>MATLAB code and datasets are available to download at http://www.duke.edu/~lw174/Fitness.zip and http://genomics.lbl.gov/supplemental/fitness-bioinf/","kes, hji",0.0,0,0,2,0.0,,zip file
23281802,BM-Map: an efficient software package for accurately allocating multireads of RNA-sequencing data.,"<h4>Background</h4>RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) has become a major tool for biomedical research. A key step in analyzing RNA-seq data is to infer the origin of short reads in the source genome, and for this purpose, many read alignment/mapping software programs have been developed. Usually, the majority of mappable reads can be mapped to one unambiguous genomic location, and these reads are called unique reads. However, a considerable proportion of mappable reads can be aligned to more than one genomic location with the same or similar fidelities, and they are called """"multireads"""". Allocating these multireads is challenging but critical for interpreting RNA-seq data. We recently developed a Bayesian stochastic model that allocates multireads more accurately than alternative methods (Ji et al. Biometrics 2011).<h4>Results</h4>In order to serve a greater biological community, we have implemented this method in a stand-alone, efficient, and user-friendly software package, BM-Map. BM-Map takes SAM (Sequence Alignment/Map), the most popular read alignment format, as the standard input; then based on the Bayesian model, it calculates mapping probabilities of multireads for competing genomic loci; and BM-Map generates the output by adding mapping probabilities to the original SAM file so that users can easily perform downstream analyses. The program is available in three common operating systems, Linux, Mac and PC. Moreover, we have built a dedicated website, http://bioinformatics.mdanderson.org/main/BM-Map, which includes free downloads, detailed tutorials and illustration examples.<h4>Conclusions</h4>We have developed a stand-alone, efficient, and user-friendly software package for accurately allocating multireads, which is an important addition to our previous methodology paper.

23303509,ALE: a generic assembly likelihood evaluation framework for assessing the accuracy of genome and metagenome assemblies.,"<h4>Motivation</h4>Researchers need general purpose methods for objectively evaluating the accuracy of single and metagenome assemblies and for automatically detecting any errors they may contain. Current methods do not fully meet this need because they require a reference, only consider one of the many aspects of assembly quality or lack statistical justification, and none are designed to evaluate metagenome assemblies.<h4>Results</h4>In this article, we present an Assembly Likelihood Evaluation (ALE) framework that overcomes these limitations, systematically evaluating the accuracy of an assembly in a reference-independent manner using rigorous statistical methods. This framework is comprehensive, and integrates read quality, mate pair orientation and insert length (for paired-end reads), sequencing coverage, read alignment and k-mer frequency. ALE pinpoints synthetic errors in both single and metagenomic assemblies, including single-base errors, insertions/deletions, genome rearrangements and chimeric assemblies presented in metagenomes. At the genome level with real-world data, ALE identifies three large misassemblies from the Spirochaeta smaragdinae finished genome, which were all independently validated by Pacific Biosciences sequencing. At the single-base level with Illumina data, ALE recovers 215 of 222 (97%) single nucleotide variants in a training set from a GC-rich Rhodobacter sphaeroides genome. Using real Pacific Biosciences data, ALE identifies 12 of 12 synthetic errors in a Lambda Phage genome, surpassing even Pacific Biosciences' own variant caller, EviCons. In summary, the ALE framework provides a comprehensive, reference-independent and statistically rigorous measure of single genome and metagenome assembly accuracy, which can be used to identify misassemblies or to optimize the assembly process.<h4>Availability</h4>ALE is released as open source software under the UoI/NCSA license at http://www.alescore.org.

23342084,Early growth response 3 (Egr3) is highly over-expressed in non-relapsing prostate cancer but not in relapsing prostate cancer.,"Members of the early growth response (EGR) family of transcription factors play diverse functions in response to many cellular stimuli, including growth, stress, and inflammation. Egr3 has gone relatively unstudied, but here through use of the SPECS (Strategic Partners for the Evaluation of Predictive Signatures of Prostate Cancer) Affymetrix whole genome gene expression database we report that Egr3 mRNA is significantly over-expressed in prostate cancer compared to normal prostate tissue (5-fold). The Human Protein Atlas (http://www.proteinatlas.org), a database of tissue microarrays labeled with antibodies against over 11,000 human proteins, was utilized to quantify Egr3 protein expression in normal prostate and prostate cancer patients. In agreement with the SPECS data, we found that Egr3 protein is significantly increased in prostate cancer. The SPECS database has the benefit of extensive clinical follow up for the prostate cancer patients. Analysis of Egr3 mRNA expression in relation to the relapse status reveals that Egr3 mRNA expression is increased in tumor cells of non-relapsed samples (n = 63) compared to normal prostate cells, but is significantly lower in relapsed samples (n = 38) compared to non-relapse. The observations were confirmed using an independent data set. A list of genes correlating with this unique expression pattern was determined. These Egr3-correlated genes were enriched with Egr binding sites in their promoters. The gene list contains inflammatory genes such as IL-6, IL-8, IL1� and COX-2, which have extensive connections to prostate cancer.","kes, hji",0.0,0,0,2,0.0,,

Our study applied high-throughput screening methods to identify causative epigenetic targets in a cohort of men with ABC-associated OSCC. We identified BEX1 and LDOC1 as two epigenetically silenced X-linked tumour suppressors and demonstrated a functional link between the transcription of BEX1 and LDOC1 and promoter hypermethylation. Methylation of the BEX1 and LDOC1 promoters was associated significantly (p < 0.0001) with OSCC and were detected in 75% (42/56) and 89% (50/56) of the samples, respectively. We observed concordant increases in the methylation of both genes in 71% (40/56) of the tumours, and potent in vitro and in vivo growth inhibitory effects in OSCC cells ectopically expressing BEX1 and/or LDOC1. Restored expression of BEX1 and LDOC1 suppressed the nuclear factor-<U+03BA>B (NF-<U+03BA>B) signalling pathway, which is the most frequently hyperactivated signalling pathway in OSCC. This suppression might result from decreased p50 and p65 expression. These findings suggest that silencing of BEX1 and LDOC1 by promoter hypermethylation might represent a critical event in the molecular pathogenesis of OSCC and account for the oncogenic effects of ABC exposure and the male predominance of OSCC occurrence.

23368677,Identifying cross-category relations in gene ontology and constructing genome-specific term association networks.,"<h4>Background</h4>Gene Ontology (GO) has been widely used in biological databases, annotation projects, and computational analyses. Although the three GO categories are structured as independent ontologies, the biological relationships across the categories are not negligible for biological reasoning and knowledge integration. However, the existing cross-category ontology term similarity measures are either developed by utilizing the GO data only or based on manually curated term name similarities, ignoring the fact that GO is evolving quickly and the gene annotations are far from complete.<h4>Results</h4>In this paper we introduce a new cross-category similarity measurement called CroGO by incorporating genome-specific gene co-function network data. The performance study showed that our measurement outperforms the existing algorithms. We also generated genome-specific term association networks for yeast and human. An enrichment based test showed our networks are better than those generated by the other measures.<h4>Conclusions</h4>The genome-specific term association networks constructed using CroGO provided a platform to enable a more consistent use of GO. In the networks, the frequently occurred MF-centered hub indicates that a molecular function may be shared by different genes in multiple biological processes, or a set of genes with the same functions may participate in distinct biological processes. And common subgraphs in multiple organisms also revealed conserved GO term relationships. Software and data are available online at http://www.msu.edu/~jinchen/CroGO.","kes, hji",0.0,0,0,2,0.0,,iffy
23375235,Learning the local Bayesian network structure around the ZNF217 oncogene in breast tumours.,"In this study, we discuss and apply a novel and efficient algorithm for learning a local Bayesian network model in the vicinity of the ZNF217 oncogene from breast cancer microarray data without having to decide in advance which genes have to be included in the learning process. ZNF217 is a candidate oncogene located at 20q13, a chromosomal region frequently amplified in breast and ovarian cancer, and correlated with shorter patient survival in these cancers. To properly address the difficulties in managing complex gene interactions given our limited sample, statistical significance of edge strengths was evaluated using bootstrapping and the less reliable edges were pruned to increase the network robustness. We found that 13 out of the 35 genes associated with deregulated ZNF217 expression in breast tumours have been previously associated with survival and/or prognosis in cancers. Identifying genes involved in lipid metabolism opens new fields of investigation to decipher the molecular mechanisms driven by the ZNF217 oncogene. Moreover, nine of the 13 genes have already been identified as putative ZNF217 targets by independent biological studies. We therefore suggest that the algorithms for inferring local BNs are valuable data mining tools for unraveling complex mechanisms of biological pathways from expression data.

However, determining the biologically significant targets of miRNAs is an ongoing challenge. In this chapter, we describe how to identify miRNA-target interactions and miRNA regulatory networks from high-throughput deep sequencing, CLIP-Seq (HITS-CLIP, PAR-CLIP) and degradome sequencing data using starBase platforms. In starBase, several web-based and stand-alone computational tools were developed to discover Argonaute (Ago) binding and cleavage sites, miRNA-target interactions, perform enrichment analysis of miRNA target genes in Gene Ontology (GO) categories and biological pathways, and identify combinatorial effects between Ago and other RNA-binding proteins (RBPs). Investigating target pathways of miRNAs in human CLIP-Seq data, we found that many cancer-associated miRNAs modulate cancer pathways. Performing an enrichment analysis of genes targeted by highly expressed miRNAs in the mouse brain showed that many miRNAs are involved in cancer-associated MAPK signaling and glioma pathways, as well as neuron-associated neurotrophin signaling and axon guidance pathways. Moreover, thousands of combinatorial binding sites between Ago and RBPs were identified from CLIP-Seq data suggesting RBPs and miRNAs coordinately regulate mRNA transcripts. As a means of comprehensively integrating CLIP-Seq and Degradome-Seq data, the starBase platform is expected to identify clinically relevant miRNA-target regulatory relationships, and reveal multi-dimensional post-transcriptional regulatory networks involving miRNAs and RBPs. starBase is available at                  http://starbase.sysu.edu.cn/                                .","kes, hji",0.0,0,0,2,0.0,,
23524031,Acute diagnostic biomarkers for spinal cord injury: review of the literature and preliminary research report.,"<h4>Objective</h4>Many efforts have been made to create new diagnostic technologies for use in the diagnosis of central nervous system injury. However, there is still no consensus for the use of biomarkers in clinical acute spinal cord injury (SCI). The aims of this review are (1) to evaluate the current status of neurochemical biomarkers and (2) to discuss their potential acute diagnostic role in SCI by reviewing the literature.<h4>Methods</h4>PubMed (http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed) was searched up to 2012 to identify publications concerning diagnostic biomarkers in SCI. To support more knowledge, we also checked secondary references in the primarily retrieved literature.<h4>Results</h4>Neurofilaments, cleaved-Tau, microtubule-associated protein 2, myelin basic protein, neuron-specific enolase, S100�, and glial fibrillary acidic protein were identified as structural protein biomarkers in SCI by this review process. We could not find reports relating ubiquitin C-terminal hydrolase-L1 and a-II spectrin breakdown products, which are widely researched in other central nervous system injuries. Therefore, we present our preliminary data relating to these two biomarkers. Some of biomarkers showed promising results for SCI diagnosis and outcome prediction; however, there were unresolved issues relating to accuracy and their accessibility.<h4>Conclusion</h4>Currently, there still are not many reports focused on diagnostic biomarkers in SCI. This fact warranted the need for greater efforts to innovate sensitive and reliable biomarkers for SCI.","kes, hji",0.0,0,0,2,0.0,,not about the resource

The objective of this study was to investigate the balance of Th17/Treg and the expression of related cytokines in Uighur cervical cancer patients.<h4>Methods</h4>Peripheral blood was collected from 65 cases of cervical cancer patients, 42 cases of cervical CIN patients and 40 healthy people. Flow cytometry was used to detect the percentages of T cell subsets, including CD3+ T cells, CD4+ T cells, CD8+ T cells, Treg cells and Th17 cells. ELISA assay was conducted to detect expression levels of TGF-�, IL-6, IL-10, IL-17, IL-23 and IFN-<U+03B3>.<h4>Results</h4>There were no significant difference in the levels of CD3+ T cells, CD4+ T cells, CD8+ T cells, and the ratio of CD4+/CD8+ among the cervical cancer group, the CIN group and the healthy control group. However, compared with the healthy control group, the percentages of CD4+ CD25+ Treg, CD4+CD25+CD127- Treg, CD4+IL17+ Th17, CD4+CD25+Foxp3+, CD4+CD25- Foxp3+, CD8+CD25+CD127-Treg and CD8+CD25+Foxp3 were significantly higher in the cervical cancer group and the CIN group. Similar results were also found in the Th17/Treg ratio and the related cytokines. There was no significant difference between the cervical cancer group and the CIN group. Additionally, Th17 cell levels were positively correlated with IL-6, IL-23 and IL-17. Also, Treg cell levels were positively correlated with TGF-�, IL-10 and IL-6. Contrarily, Treg cell levels and IFN-<U+03B3> were negatively correlated.<h4>Conclusions</h4>Our data indicated that the Th17/Treg balance was broken in peripheral blood of cervical cancer patients. Analysis of Th17/Treg balance may have a significant implication in diagnosing cervical cancer.<h4>Virtual slides</h4>The virtual slide for this article can be found here: http://www.diagnosticpathology.diagnomx.eu/vs/1813823795931511.","kes, hji",0.0,0,0,2,0.0,,
23664230,Application of the Bayesian approach for derivation of PDFs for concentration ratio values.,"Concentration ratios (CRs) are used to derive activity concentrations in wild plants and animals. Usually, compilations of CR values encompass a wide range of element-organism combinations, extracted from different studies with statistical information reported at varying degrees of detail. To produce a more robust estimation of distribution parameters, data from different studies are normally pooled using classical statistical methods. However, there is inherent subjectivity involved in pooling CR data in the sense that there is a tacit assumption that the CRs under any arbitrarily defined biota category belong to the same population. Here, Bayesian inference has been introduced as an alternative way of making estimates of distribution parameters of CRs. This approach, in contrast to classical methods, is more flexible and also allows us to define the various assumptions required, when combining data, in a more explicit manner. Taking selected data from the recently compiled wildlife transfer database (http://www.wildlifetransferdatabase.org/) as a working example, attempts are made to refine the pooling approaches previously used and to consider situations when empirical data are limited.","kes, hji",0.0,0,0,2,0.0,,but usedful ref
23685432,DRIMust: a web server for discovering rank imbalanced motifs using suffix trees.,"Cellular regulation mechanisms that involve proteins and other active molecules interacting with specific targets often involve the recognition of sequence patterns. Short sequence elements on DNA, RNA and proteins play a central role in mediating such molecular recognition events. Studies that focus on measuring and investigating sequence-based recognition processes make use of statistical and computational tools that support the identification and understanding of sequence motifs. We present a new web application, named DRIMust, freely accessible through the website http://drimust.technion.ac.il for de novo motif discovery services. The DRIMust algorithm is based on the minimum hypergeometric statistical framework and uses suffix trees for an efficient enumeration of motif candidates. DRIMust takes as input ranked lists of sequences in FASTA format and returns motifs that are over-represented at the top of the list, where the determination of the threshold that defines top is data driven. The resulting motifs are presented individually with an accurate P-value indication and as a Position Specific Scoring Matrix. Comparing DRIMust with other state-of-the-art tools demonstrated significant advantage to DRIMust, both in result accuracy and in short running times. Overall, DRIMust is unique in combining efficient search on large ranked lists with rigorous P-value assessment for the detected motifs.","kes, hji",0.0,0,0,2,0.0,,

23737449,antiSMASH 2.0--a versatile platform for genome mining of secondary metabolite producers.,"Microbial secondary metabolites are a potent source of antibiotics and other pharmaceuticals. Genome mining of their biosynthetic gene clusters has become a key method to accelerate their identification and characterization. In 2011, we developed antiSMASH, a web-based analysis platform that automates this process. Here, we present the highly improved antiSMASH 2.0 release, available at http://antismash.secondarymetabolites.org/. For the new version, antiSMASH was entirely re-designed using a plug-and-play concept that allows easy integration of novel predictor or output modules. antiSMASH 2.0 now supports input of multiple related sequences simultaneously (multi-FASTA/GenBank/EMBL), which allows the analysis of draft genomes comprising multiple contigs. Moreover, direct analysis of protein sequences is now possible. antiSMASH 2.0 has also been equipped with the capacity to detect additional classes of secondary metabolites, including oligosaccharide antibiotics, phenazines, thiopeptides, homo-serine lactones, phosphonates and furans. The algorithm for predicting the core structure of the cluster end product is now also covering lantipeptides, in addition to polyketides and non-ribosomal peptides. The antiSMASH ClusterBlast functionality has been extended to identify sub-clusters involved in the biosynthesis of specific chemical building blocks. The new features currently make antiSMASH 2.0 the most comprehensive resource for identifying and analyzing novel secondary metabolite biosynthetic pathways in microorganisms.","kes, hji",0.0,0,0,2,0.0,,
23761447,ResponseNet2.0: Revealing signaling and regulatory pathways connecting your proteins and genes--now with human data.,"Genome sequencing and transcriptomic profiling are two widely used approaches for the identification of human disease pathways. However, each approach typically provides a limited view of disease pathways: Genome sequencing can identify disease-related mutations but rarely reveals their mode-of-action, while transcriptomic assays do not reveal the series of events that lead to the transcriptomic change. ResponseNet is an integrative network-optimization approach that we developed to fill these gaps by highlighting major signaling and regulatory molecular interaction paths that connect disease-related mutations and genes. The ResponseNet web-server provides a user-friendly interface to ResponseNet. Specifically, users can upload weighted lists of proteins and genes and obtain a sparse, weighted, molecular interaction subnetwork connecting them, that is biased toward regulatory and signaling pathways. ResponseNet2.0 enhances the functionality of the ResponseNet web-server in two important ways. First, it supports analysis of human data by offering a human interactome composed of proteins, genes and micro-RNAs. Second, it offers a new informative view of the output, including a randomization analysis, to help users assess the biological relevance of the output subnetwork.

23812995,Compressive genomics for protein databases.,"<h4>Motivation</h4>The exponential growth of protein sequence databases has increasingly made the fundamental question of searching for homologs a computational bottleneck. The amount of unique data, however, is not growing nearly as fast; we can exploit this fact to greatly accelerate homology search. Acceleration of programs in the popular PSI/DELTA-BLAST family of tools will not only speed-up homology search directly but also the huge collection of other current programs that primarily interact with large protein databases via precisely these tools.<h4>Results</h4>We introduce a suite of homology search tools, powered by compressively accelerated protein BLAST (CaBLASTP), which are significantly faster than and comparably accurate with all known state-of-the-art tools, including HHblits, DELTA-BLAST and PSI-BLAST. Further, our tools are implemented in a manner that allows direct substitution into existing analysis pipelines. The key idea is that we introduce a local similarity-based compression scheme that allows us to operate directly on the compressed data. Importantly, CaBLASTP's runtime scales almost linearly in the amount of unique data, as opposed to current BLASTP variants, which scale linearly in the size of the full protein database being searched. Our compressive algorithms will speed-up many tasks, such as protein structure prediction and orthology mapping, which rely heavily on homology search.<h4>Availability</h4>CaBLASTP is available under the GNU Public License at http://cablastp.csail.mit.edu/<h4>Contact</h4>bab@mit.edu.","kes, hji",0.0,0,0,2,0.0,,
23813003,Using state machines to model the Ion Torrent sequencing process and to improve read error rates.,"<h4>Motivation</h4>The importance of fast and affordable DNA sequencing methods for current day life sciences, medicine and biotechnology is hard to overstate. A major player is Ion Torrent, a pyrosequencing-like technology which produces flowgrams--sequences of incorporation values--which are converted into nucleotide sequences by a base-calling algorithm. Because of its exploitation of ubiquitous semiconductor technology and innovation in chemistry, Ion Torrent has been gaining popularity since its debut in 2011. Despite the advantages, however, Ion Torrent read accuracy remains a significant concern.<h4>Results</h4>We present FlowgramFixer, a new algorithm for converting flowgrams into reads. Our key observation is that the incorporation signals of neighboring flows, even after normalization and phase correction, carry considerable mutual information and are important in making the correct base-call. We therefore propose that base-calling of flowgrams should be done on a read-wide level, rather than one flow at a time. We show that this can be done in linear-time by combining a state machine with a Viterbi algorithm to find the nucleotide sequence that maximizes the likelihood of the observed flowgram. FlowgramFixer is applicable to any flowgram-based sequencing platform. We demonstrate FlowgramFixer's superior performance on Ion Torrent Escherichia coli data, with a 4.8% improvement in the number of high-quality mapped reads and a 7.1% improvement in the number of uniquely mappable reads.<h4>Availability</h4>Binaries and source code of FlowgramFixer are freely available at: http://www.cs.tau.ac.il/~davidgo5/flowgramfixer.html.","kes, hji",0.0,0,0,2,0.0,,
23824634,Validating a Coarse-Grained Potential Energy Function through Protein Loop Modelling.,"Coarse-grained (CG) methods for sampling protein conformational space have the potential to increase computational efficiency by reducing the degrees of freedom. The gain in computational efficiency of CG methods often comes at the expense of non-protein like local conformational features. This could cause problems when transitioning to full atom models in a hierarchical framework. Here, a CG potential energy function was validated by applying it to the problem of loop prediction. A novel method to sample the conformational space of backbone atoms was benchmarked using a standard test set consisting of 351 distinct loops. This method used a sequence-independent CG potential energy function representing the protein using [Formula: see text]-carbon positions only and sampling conformations with a Monte Carlo simulated annealing based protocol. Backbone atoms were added using a method previously described and then gradient minimised in the Rosetta force field. Despite the CG potential energy function being sequence-independent, the method performed similarly to methods that explicitly use either fragments of known protein backbones with similar sequences or residue-specific [Formula: see text]/[Formula: see text]-maps to restrict the search space. The method was also able to predict with sub-Angstrom accuracy two out of seven loops from recently solved crystal structures of proteins with low sequence and structure similarity to previously deposited structures in the PDB. The ability to sample realistic loop conformations directly from a potential energy function enables the incorporation of additional geometric restraints and the use of more advanced sampling methods in a way that is not possible to do easily with fragment replacement methods and also enable multi-scale simulations for protein design and protein structure prediction. These restraints could be derived from experimental data or could be design restraints in the case of computational protein design.

23829391,An untargeted metabolomic workflow to improve structural characterization of metabolites.,"Mass spectrometry-based metabolomics relies on MS(2) data for structural characterization of metabolites. To obtain the high-quality MS(2) data necessary to support metabolite identifications, ions of interest must be purely isolated for fragmentation. Here, we show that metabolomic MS(2) data are frequently characterized by contaminating ions that prevent structural identification. Although using narrow-isolation windows can minimize contaminating MS(2) fragments, even narrow windows are not always selective enough, and they can complicate data analysis by removing isotopic patterns from MS(2) spectra. Moreover, narrow windows can significantly reduce sensitivity. In this work, we introduce a novel, two-part approach for performing metabolomic identifications that addresses these issues. First, we collect MS(2) scans with less stringent isolation settings to obtain improved sensitivity at the expense of specificity. Then, by evaluating MS(2) fragment intensities as a function of retention time and precursor mass targeted for MS(2) analysis, we obtain deconvolved MS(2) spectra that are consistent with pure standards and can therefore be used for metabolite identification. The value of our approach is highlighted with metabolic extracts from brain, liver, astrocytes, as well as nerve tissue, and performance is evaluated by using pure metabolite standards in combination with simulations based on raw MS(2) data from the METLIN metabolite database.

23851377,CoLIde: a bioinformatics tool for CO-expression-based small RNA Loci Identification using high-throughput sequencing data.,"Small RNAs (sRNAs) are 20-25 nt non-coding RNAs that act as guides for the highly sequence-specific regulatory mechanism known as RNA silencing. Due to the recent increase in sequencing depth, a highly complex and diverse population of sRNAs in both plants and animals has been revealed. However, the exponential increase in sequencing data has also made the identification of individual sRNA transcripts corresponding to biological units (sRNA loci) more challenging when based exclusively on the genomic location of the constituent sRNAs, hindering existing approaches to identify sRNA loci. To infer the location of significant biological units, we propose an approach for sRNA loci detection called CoLIde (Co-expression based sRNA Loci Identification) that combines genomic location with the analysis of other information such as variation in expression levels (expression pattern) and size class distribution. For CoLIde, we define a locus as a union of regions sharing the same pattern and located in close proximity on the genome. Biological relevance, detected through the analysis of size class distribution, is also calculated for each locus. CoLIde can be applied on ordered (e.g., time-dependent) or un-ordered (e.g., organ, mutant) series of samples both with or without biological/technical replicates. The method reliably identifies known types of loci and shows improved performance on sequencing data from both plants (e.g., A. thaliana, S. lycopersicum) and animals (e.g., D. melanogaster) when compared with existing locus detection techniques.

23853063,Exhaustively characterizing feasible logic models of a signaling network using Answer Set Programming.,"<h4>Motivation</h4>Logic modeling is a useful tool to study signal transduction across multiple pathways. Logic models can be generated by training a network containing the prior knowledge to phospho-proteomics data. The training can be performed using stochastic optimization procedures, but these are unable to guarantee a global optima or to report the complete family of feasible models. This, however, is essential to provide precise insight in the mechanisms underlaying signal transduction and generate reliable predictions.<h4>Results</h4>We propose the use of Answer Set Programming to explore exhaustively the space of feasible logic models. Toward this end, we have developed caspo, an open-source Python package that provides a powerful platform to learn and characterize logic models by leveraging the rich modeling language and solving technologies of Answer Set Programming. We illustrate the usefulness of caspo by revisiting a model of pro-growth and inflammatory pathways in liver cells. We show that, if experimental error is taken into account, there are thousands (11 700) of models compatible with the data. Despite the large number, we can extract structural features from the models, such as links that are always (or never) present or modules that appear in a mutual exclusive fashion. To further characterize this family of models, we investigate the input-output behavior of the models. We find 91 behaviors across the 11 700 models and we suggest new experiments to discriminate among them. Our results underscore the importance of characterizing in a global and exhaustive manner the family of feasible models, with important implications for experimental design.<h4>Availability</h4>caspo is freely available for download (license GPLv3) and as a web service at http://caspo.genouest.org/.<h4>Supplementary information</h4>Supplementary materials are available at Bioinformatics online.<h4>Contact</h4>santiago.videla@irisa.fr.","kes, hji",0.0,0,0,2,0.0,,

Main outcomes were 1) linear growth from 6 to 12 mo of age; 2) hemoglobin, hematocrit, iron [serum ferritin (SF)], and zinc status at 12 mo of age; and 3) meat intake at 12 mo of age (by using a food-frequency questionnaire).<h4>Results</h4>A total of 38 infants/group provided data at 12 mo of age. NGG infants had significantly higher red meat intake [mean � SD: 5.4 � 1.8 compared with 3.5 � 1.7 d/wk at 12 mo of age; P < 0.001), higher hemoglobin and hematocrit at 12 mo of age, and a significantly greater increase in hemoglobin (mean � SD change: 0.41 � 0.8 compared with -0.13 � 1.0; P = 0.01) and hematocrit (1.04 � 2.2 compared with -0.15 � 2.4; P = 0.03) from 6 to 12 mo of age than those in CG infants. There were no significant differences in linear growth from 6 to 12 mo of age or in SF or zinc.<h4>Conclusions</h4>The new guidelines showed efficacy with higher red meat intake and positive effects on hemoglobin and hematocrit.

23956306,Incorporating prior knowledge into Gene Network Study.,"<h4>Motivation</h4>A major goal in genomic research is to identify genes that may jointly influence a biological response. From many years of intensive biomedical research, a large body of biological knowledge, or pathway information, has accumulated in available databases. There is a strong interest in leveraging these pathways to improve the statistical power and interpretability in studying gene networks associated with complex phenotypes. This prior information is a valuable complement to large-scale genomic data such as gene expression data generated from microarrays. However, it is a non-trivial task to effectively integrate available biological knowledge into gene expression data when reconstructing gene networks.<h4>Results</h4>In this article, we developed and applied a Lasso method from a Bayesian perspective, a method we call prior Lasso (pLasso), for the reconstruction of gene networks. In this method, we partition edges between genes into two subsets: one subset of edges is present in known pathways, whereas the other has no prior information associated. Our method assigns different prior distributions to each subset according to a modified Bayesian information criterion that incorporates prior knowledge on both the network structure and the pathway information. Simulation studies have indicated that the method is more effective in recovering the underlying network than a traditional Lasso method that does not use the prior information. We applied pLasso to microarray gene expression datasets, where we used information from the Pathway Commons (PC) and the Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) as prior information for the network reconstruction, and successfully identified network hub genes associated with clinical outcome in cancer patients.<h4>Availability</h4>The source code is available at http://nba.uth.tmc.edu/homepage/liu/pLasso.","kes, hji",0.0,0,0,2,0.0,,
23975194,A modular framework for gene set analysis integrating multilevel omics data.,"Modern high-throughput methods allow the investigation of biological functions across multiple 'omics' levels. Levels include mRNA and protein expression profiling as well as additional knowledge on, for example, DNA methylation and microRNA regulation. The reason for this interest in multi-omics is that actual cellular responses to different conditions are best explained mechanistically when taking all omics levels into account. To map gene products to their biological functions, public ontologies like Gene Ontology are commonly used. Many methods have been developed to identify terms in an ontology, overrepresented within a set of genes. However, these methods are not able to appropriately deal with any combination of several data types. Here, we propose a new method to analyse integrated data across multiple omics-levels to simultaneously assess their biological meaning. We developed a model-based Bayesian method for inferring interpretable term probabilities in a modular framework. Our Multi-level ONtology Analysis (MONA) algorithm performed significantly better than conventional analyses of individual levels and yields best results even for sophisticated models including mRNA fine-tuning by microRNAs. The MONA framework is flexible enough to allow for different underlying regulatory motifs or ontologies.

It contains two copies each of the four core histones H2A, H2B, H3 and H4 and about 147 bp of DNA. The residues of the histone proteins are subject to numerous post-translational modifications, such as methylation or acetylation. Chromatin immunoprecipitiation followed by sequencing (ChIP-seq) is a technique that provides genome-wide occupancy data of these modified histone proteins, and it requires appropriate computational methods.<h4>Results</h4>We present NucHunter, an algorithm that uses the data from ChIP-seq experiments directed against many histone modifications to infer positioned nucleosomes. NucHunter annotates each of these nucleosomes with the intensities of the histone modifications. We demonstrate that these annotations can be used to infer nucleosomal states with distinct correlations to underlying genomic features and chromatin-related processes, such as transcriptional start sites, enhancers, elongation by RNA polymerase II and chromatin-mediated repression. Thus, NucHunter is a versatile tool that can be used to predict positioned nucleosomes from a panel of histone modification ChIP-seq experiments and infer distinct histone modification patterns associated to different chromatin states.<h4>Availability</h4>The software is available at http://epigen.molgen.mpg.de/nuchunter/.","kes, hji",0.0,0,0,2,0.0,,

Achievements in this area are expected to result in effective drug design (especially for HIV-1 protease inhibitors) against this life-threatening virus. However, some drawbacks (like the shortage of the available training data and the high dimensionality of the feature space) turn this task into a difficult classification problem. Thus, various machine learning techniques, and specifically several classification methods have been proposed in order to increase the accuracy of the classification model. In addition, for several classification problems, which are characterized by having few samples and many features, selecting the most relevant features is a major factor for increasing classification accuracy.<h4>Results</h4>We propose for HIV-1 data a consistency-based feature selection approach in conjunction with recursive feature elimination of support vector machines (SVMs). We used various classifiers for evaluating the results obtained from the feature selection process. We further demonstrated the effectiveness of our proposed method by comparing it with a state-of-the-art feature selection method applied on HIV-1 data, and we evaluated the reported results based on attributes which have been selected from different combinations.<h4>Conclusion</h4>Applying feature selection on training data before realizing the classification task seems to be a reasonable data-mining process when working with types of data similar to HIV-1. On HIV-1 data, some feature selection or extraction operations in conjunction with different classifiers have been tested and noteworthy outcomes have been reported. These facts motivate for the work presented in this paper.<h4>Software availability</h4>The software is available at http://ozyer.etu.edu.tr/c-fs-svm.rar.

24206655,Association of a polymorphism in PON-1 gene with steroid-induced osteonecrosis of femoral head in Chinese Han population.,"<h4>Background</h4>Treatment with steroids covers a wide spectrum of diseases in clinic. However, some users are suffering from serious side effects of steroid administration, while we enjoy the benefit it brings about. Osteonecrosis of the femoral head (ONFH) is a troublesome one among them. Recent studies have demonstrated that lipid metabolism disorder may play a vital role in pathogenesis of ONFH and mutation of the paraoxonase-1 (PON-1) gene may be involved in the occurrence of this disease. However, the relationship between polymorphisms of PON-1 and ONFH has not been thoroughly studied. The aim of this study was to determine whether PON-1 polymorphisms are associated with steroid-induced ONFH through a cohort study among Chinese Han population.<h4>Methods</h4>This trial applied a case-control scheme to compare the clinical data including PON-1 SNP among 94 patients and 106 control subjects to analyze the association between SNP and risk of steroid-induced ONFH. Time of Flight Mass Spectrometer is utilized for genotyping and the result was analyzed in multivariate analysis models.<h4>Results</h4>According to polymorphism test of rs662, its SNP was significantly associated with the risk of ONFH in overdominant analysis model [P value: 0.022; odds ratio (OR): 0.39]. However, genotype frequencies of rs662 of PON-1 gene between case and control group showed no differences (P > 0.05).<h4>Conclusions</h4>Our data suggest for the first time that SNP (rs662) of the PON-1 gene was associated with the risk of steroid-induced ONFH. In addition, PAI-1 SNPs may play an important role in pathogenesis of ONFH.<h4>Virtual slides</h4>The virtual slide(s) for this article can be found here: http://www.diagnosticphatology.diagnomx.eu/vs/1501829501107336.","kes, hji",0.0,0,0,2,0.0,,
24250114,SNPAAMapper: An efficient genome-wide SNP variant analysis pipeline for next-generation sequencing data.,"<h4>Unlabelled</h4>Many NGS analysis tools focusing on read alignment and variant calling functions for exome sequencing data have been developed in recent years. However, publicly available tools dealing with the downstream analysis of genome-wide variants are fewer and have limited functionality. We developed SNPAAMapper, a novel variant analysis pipeline that can effectively classify variants by region (e.g. CDS, UTRs, intron, upstream, downstream), predict amino acid change type (e.g. synonymous, non-synonymous mutation), and prioritize mutation effects (e.g. CDS versus UTRs). Additional functionality afforded by our pipeline includes: checking variants at exon/intron junctions, customized homozygosity and allele frequency cutoff parameters, and annotation of known variants with dbSNP information, listing original and mutated amino acid sequences containing variants. The final result is reported in a spreadsheet format table containing all variant associated information and prioritized amino acids effects for investigators to examine.<h4>Availability</h4>Perl scripts and required input files are available on the web at http://www.ccmb.med.umich.edu/ccdu /SNPAAMapper.","kes, hji",0.0,0,0,2,0.0,,
24259518,Quantitative proteomic profiling reveals novel region-specific markers in the adult mouse brain.,"Despite major advances in neuroscience, a comprehensive understanding of the structural and functional components of the adult brain compartments remains to be fully elucidated at a quantitative molecular level. Indeed, over half of the soluble- and membrane-annotated proteins are currently unmapped within online digital brain atlases. In this study, two complementary approaches were used to assess the unique repertoire of proteins enriched within select regions of the adult mouse CNS, including the brain stem, cerebellum, and remaining brain hemispheres. Of the 1200 proteins visualized by 2D-DIGE, approximately 150 (including cytosolic and membrane proteins) were found to exhibit statistically significant changes in relative abundance thus representing putative region-specific brain markers. In addition to using a high-precision (18) O-labeling strategy for the quantitative LC-MS/MS mapping of membrane proteins isolated from myelin-enriched fractions, we have identified over 1000 proteins that have yet to be described in any other mammalian myelin proteome. A comparison of our myelin proteome was made to an existing transcriptome database containing mRNA abundance profiles during oligodendrocyte differentiation and has confirmed statistically significant abundance changes for ~500 of these newly mapped proteins, thus revealing new roles in oligodendrocyte and myelin biology. These data offer a resource for the neuroscience community studying the molecular basis for specialized neuronal activities in the CNS and myelin-related disorders.

24307635,Comparative proteomics reveals key proteins recruited at the nucleoid of Deinococcus after irradiation-induced DNA damage.,"The nucleoids of radiation-resistant Deinococcus species show a high degree of compaction maintained after ionizing irradiation. We identified proteins recruited after irradiation in nucleoids of Deinococcus radiodurans and Deinococcus deserti by means of comparative proteomics. Proteins in nucleoid-enriched fractions from unirradiated and irradiated Deinococcus were identified and semiquantified by shotgun proteomics. The ssDNA-binding protein SSB, DNA gyrase subunits GyrA and GyrB, DNA topoisomerase I, RecA recombinase, UvrA excinuclease, RecQ helicase, DdrA, DdrB, and DdrD proteins were found in significantly higher amounts in irradiated nucleoids of both Deinococcus species. We observed, by immunofluorescence microscopy, the subcellular localization of these proteins in D. radiodurans, showing for the first time the recruitment of the DdrD protein into the D. radiodurans nucleoid. We specifically followed the kinetics of recruitment of RecA, DdrA, and DdrD to the nucleoid after irradiation. Remarkably, RecA proteins formed irregular filament-like structures 1 h after irradiation, before being redistributed throughout the cells by 3 h post-irradiation. Comparable dynamics of DdrD localization were observed, suggesting a possible functional interaction between RecA and DdrD. Several proteins involved in nucleotide synthesis were also seen in higher quantities in the nucleoids of irradiated cells, indicative of the existence of a mechanism for orchestrating the presence of proteins involved in DNA metabolism in nucleoids in response to massive DNA damage.

24312116,The power of regional heritability analysis for rare and common variant detection: simulations and application to eye biometrical traits.,"Genome-wide association studies (GWAS) have provided valuable insights into the genetic basis of complex traits. However, they have explained relatively little trait heritability. Recently, we proposed a new analytical approach called regional heritability mapping (RHM) that captures more of the missing genetic variation. This method is applicable both to related and unrelated populations. Here, we demonstrate the power of RHM in comparison with single-SNP GWAS and gene-based association approaches under a wide range of scenarios with variable numbers of quantitative trait loci (QTL) with common and rare causal variants in a narrow genomic region. Simulations based on real genotype data were performed to assess power to capture QTL variance, and we demonstrate that RHM has greater power to detect rare variants and/or multiple alleles in a region than other approaches. In addition, we show that RHM can capture more accurately the QTL variance, when it is caused by multiple independent effects and/or rare variants. We applied RHM to analyze three biometrical eye traits for which single-SNP GWAS have been published or performed to evaluate the effectiveness of this method in real data analysis and detected some additional loci which were not detected by other GWAS methods. RHM has the potential to explain some of missing heritability by capturing variance caused by QTL with low MAF and multiple independent QTL in a region, not captured by other GWAS methods. RHM analyses can be implemented using the software REACTA (http://www.epcc.ed.ac.uk/projects-portfolio/reacta).","kes, hji",0.0,0,0,2,0.0,,

The neXtProt database (September 2013) lists 20,128 proteins for the human proteome, of which 3831 human proteins (~19%) are considered """"missing"""" according to the standard metrics table (released September 27, 2013). In support of the C-HPP initiative, we have extended the annotation strategy developed for human chromosome 7 """"missing"""" proteins into a semiautomated pipeline to functionally annotate the """"missing"""" human proteome. This pipeline integrates a suite of bioinformatics analysis and annotation software tools to identify homologues and map putative functional signatures, gene ontology, and biochemical pathways. From sequential BLAST searches, we have primarily identified homologues from reviewed nonhuman mammalian proteins with protein evidence for 1271 (33.2%) """"missing"""" proteins, followed by 703 (18.4%) homologues from reviewed nonhuman mammalian proteins and subsequently 564 (14.7%) homologues from reviewed human proteins. Functional annotations for 1945 (50.8%) """"missing"""" proteins were also determined. To accelerate the identification of """"missing"""" proteins from proteomics studies, we generated proteotypic peptides in silico. Matching these proteotypic peptides to ENCODE proteogenomic data resulted in proteomic evidence for 107 (2.8%) of the 3831 """"missing proteins, while evidence from a recent membrane proteomic study supported the existence for another 15 """"missing"""" proteins.

24334622,Metagenomic frameworks for monitoring antibiotic resistance in aquatic environments.,"<h4>Background</h4>High-throughput genomic technologies offer new approaches for environmental health monitoring, including metagenomic surveillance of antibiotic resistance determinants (ARDs). Although natural environments serve as reservoirs for antibiotic resistance genes that can be transferred to pathogenic and human commensal bacteria, monitoring of these determinants has been infrequent and incomplete. Furthermore, surveillance efforts have not been integrated into public health decision making.<h4>Objectives</h4>We used a metagenomic epidemiology-based approach to develop an ARD index that quantifies antibiotic resistance potential, and we analyzed this index for common modal patterns across environmental samples. We also explored how metagenomic data such as this index could be conceptually framed within an early risk management context.<h4>Methods</h4>We analyzed 25 published data sets from shotgun pyrosequencing projects. The samples consisted of microbial community DNA collected from marine and freshwater environments across a gradient of human impact. We used principal component analysis to identify index patterns across samples.<h4>Results</h4>We observed significant differences in the overall index and index subcategory levels when comparing ecosystems more proximal versus distal to human impact. The selection of different sequence similarity thresholds strongly influenced the index measurements. Unique index subcategory modes distinguished the different metagenomes.<h4>Conclusions</h4>Broad-scale screening of ARD potential using this index revealed utility for framing environmental health monitoring and surveillance. This approach holds promise as a screening tool for establishing baseline ARD levels that can be used to inform and prioritize decision making regarding management of ARD sources and human exposure routes.<h4>Citation</h4>Port JA, Cullen AC, Wallace JC, Smith MN, Faustman EM. 2014.

24367574,Switch of sensitivity dynamics revealed with DyGloSA toolbox for dynamical global sensitivity analysis as an early warning for system's critical transition.,"Systems with bifurcations may experience abrupt irreversible and often unwanted shifts in their performance, called critical transitions. For many systems like climate, economy, ecosystems it is highly desirable to identify indicators serving as early warnings of such regime shifts. Several statistical measures were recently proposed as early warnings of critical transitions including increased variance, autocorrelation and skewness of experimental or model-generated data. The lack of automatized tool for model-based prediction of critical transitions led to designing DyGloSA - a MATLAB toolbox for dynamical global parameter sensitivity analysis (GPSA) of ordinary differential equations models. We suggest that the switch in dynamics of parameter sensitivities revealed by our toolbox is an early warning that a system is approaching a critical transition. We illustrate the efficiency of our toolbox by analyzing several models with bifurcations and predicting the time periods when systems can still avoid going to a critical transition by manipulating certain parameter values, which is not detectable with the existing SA techniques. DyGloSA is based on the SBToolbox2 and contains functions, which compute dynamically the global sensitivity indices of the system by applying four main GPSA methods: eFAST, Sobol's ANOVA, PRCC and WALS. It includes parallelized versions of the functions enabling significant reduction of the computational time (up to 12 times). DyGloSA is freely available as a set of MATLAB scripts at http://bio.uni.lu/systems_biology/software/dyglosa. It requires installation of MATLAB (versions R2008b or later) and the Systems Biology Toolbox2 available at www.sbtoolbox2.org.

Videos illustrated aspects of language, sophistication of play and socialisation, cognition, and motor progress. Expert commentary, teaching text and summaries were used. A randomised controlled trial evaluated the resource. Paediatric trainees were recruited from The Sydney Children's Hospitals Network. Outcome measures were repeated at three time points (pre-teaching, immediate-post and 1 month) and included self-rated attitudes, knowledge of markers of development and observational expertise. Qualitative data on teaching usefulness were obtained through open-ended questions.<h4>Results</h4>Fifty-six paediatric trainees (registrar 79%, women 82%; mean age 31 years) completed the pre-assessment, 46 the immediate-post and 45 the 1-month follow-up (20% attrition). Compared with the Control group, the Teaching group scored higher over time on markers of development (P = 0.006), observational expertise (P < 0.0001), confidence (P = 0.035) and satisfaction (P < 0.0001). Teaching participants valued the video and expert commentary and reported improvement in confidence and understanding and acquiring a more structured approach.<h4>Conclusions</h4>The 'Beyond Milestones' free online resource for medical professionals <http://learnpaediatrics.org/beyondmilestones/ password=cunningham> improves knowledge, increases confidence and is useful, providing a structured approach to developmental assessment.

24479843,Quantitative structure-property relationship modeling: a valuable support in high-throughput screening quality control.,"Evaluation of important pharmacokinetic properties such as hydrophobicity by high-throughput screening (HTS) methods is a major issue in drug discovery. In this paper, we present measurements of the chromatographic hydrophobicity index (CHI) on a subset of the French chemical library Chimioth�que Nationale (CN). The data were used in quantitative structure-property relationship (QSPR) modeling in order to annotate the CN. An algorithm is proposed to detect problematic molecules with large prediction errors, called outliers. In order to find an explanation for these large discrepancies between predicted and experimental values, these compounds were reanalyzed experimentally. As the first selected outliers indeed had experimental problems, including hydrolysis or sheer absence of expected structure, we herewith propose the use of QSPR as a support tool for quality control of screening data and encourage cooperation between experimental and theoretical teams to improve results.

24507755,Systematic characterization of small RNAome during zebrafish early developmental stages.,"<h4>Background</h4>During early vertebrate development, various small non-coding RNAs (sRNAs) such as MicroRNAs (miRNAs) and Piwi-interacting RNAs (piRNAs) are dynamically expressed for orchestrating the maternal-to-zygotic transition (MZT). Systematic analysis of expression profiles of zebrafish small RNAome will be greatly helpful for understanding the sRNA regulation during embryonic development.<h4>Results</h4>We first determined the expression profiles of sRNAs during eight distinct stages of early zebrafish development by sRNA-seq technology. Integrative analyses with a new computational platform of CSZ (characterization of small RNAome for zebrafish) demonstrated an sRNA class transition from piRNAs to miRNAs as development proceeds. We observed that both the abundance and diversity of miRNAs are gradually increased, while the abundance is enhanced more dramatically than the diversity during development. However, although both the abundance and diversity of piRNAs are gradually decreased, the diversity was firstly increased then rapidly decreased. To evaluate the computational accuracy, the expression levels of four known miRNAs were experimentally validated. We also predicted 25 potentially novel miRNAs, whereas two candidates were verified by Northern blots.<h4>Conclusions</h4>Taken together, our analyses revealed the piRNA to miRNA transition as a conserved mechanism in zebrafish, although two different types of sRNAs exhibit distinct expression dynamics in abundance and diversity, respectively. Our study not only generated a better understanding for sRNA regulations in early zebrafish development, but also provided a useful platform for analyzing sRNA-seq data.

24564522,Incorporating substrate sequence motifs and spatial amino acid composition to identify kinase-specific phosphorylation sites on protein three-dimensional structures.,"<h4>Background</h4>Protein phosphorylation catalyzed by kinases plays crucial regulatory roles in cellular processes. Given the high-throughput mass spectrometry-based experiments, the desire to annotate the catalytic kinases for in vivo phosphorylation sites has motivated. Thus, a variety of computational methods have been developed for performing a large-scale prediction of kinase-specific phosphorylation sites. However, most of the proposed methods solely rely on the local amino acid sequences surrounding the phosphorylation sites. An increasing number of three-dimensional structures make it possible to physically investigate the structural environment of phosphorylation sites.<h4>Results</h4>In this work, all of the experimental phosphorylation sites are mapped to the protein entries of Protein Data Bank by sequence identity. It resulted in a total of 4508 phosphorylation sites containing the protein three-dimensional (3D) structures. To identify phosphorylation sites on protein 3D structures, this work incorporates support vector machines (SVMs) with the information of linear motifs and spatial amino acid composition, which is determined for each kinase group by calculating the relative frequencies of 20 amino acid types within a specific radial distance from central phosphorylated amino acid residue. After the cross-validation evaluation, most of the kinase-specific models trained with the consideration of structural information outperform the models considering only the sequence information. Furthermore, the independent testing set which is not included in training set has demonstrated that the proposed method could provide a comparable performance to other popular tools.<h4>Conclusion</h4>The proposed method is shown to be capable of predicting kinase-specific phosphorylation sites on 3D structures and has been implemented as a web server which is freely accessible at http://csb.cse.yzu.edu.tw/PhosK3D/. Due to the difficulty of identifying the kinase-specific phosphorylation sites with similar sequenced motifs, this work also integrates the 3D structural information to improve the cross classifying specificity.","kes, hji",0.0,0,0,2,0.0,,not found

BRAF(V600E) mutation and DNA methylation are useful markers to distinguish malignant thyroid neoplasm from benign. The aim of this study was to determine whether combined detection of BRAF(V600E) mutation and methylation markers on FNABs could improve the diagnostic accuracy of thyroid cancer.<h4>Methods</h4>Using pyrosequencing and quantitative methylation-specific PCR (Q-MSP) methods, FNABs from 79 and 38 patients with thyroid nodules in training and test groups, respectively, were analyzed for BRAF(V600E) mutation and gene methylation.<h4>Results</h4>BRAF(V600E) mutation was found in 30/42 (71.4%) and 14/20 (70%) FNABs in training and test groups, respectively. All BRAF(V600E)-positive samples were histologically diagnosed as papillary thyroid cancer (PTC) after thyroidectomy. As expected, BRAF mutation was not found in all benign nodules. Moreover, we demonstrated that the five genes, including CALCA, DAPK1, TIMP3, RAR-beta and RASSF1A, were aberrantly methylated in FNABs. Of them, methylation level of DAPK1 in PTCs was significantly higher than that in benign samples (P <0.0001). Conversely, methylation level of RASSF1A in PTCs was significantly lower than that in benign samples (P =0.003). Notably, compared with BRAF mutation testing alone, combined detection of BRAF mutation and methylation markers increased the diagnostic sensitivity and accuracy of PTC with excellent specificity.<h4>Conclusion</h4>Our data have demonstrated that combine analysis of BRAF mutation and DNA methylation markers on FNABs may be a useful strategy to facilitate the diagnosis of malignant thyroid neoplasm, particularly PTC.<h4>Virtual slides</h4>The virtual slide(s) for this article can be found here: http://www.diagnosticpathology.diagnomx.eu/vs/6080878071149177.","kes, hji",0.0,0,0,2,0.0,,

We defined regions within which patients were likely to compare hospitals using the hospital referral regions (HRRs) from the Dartmouth Atlas of Health Care Project. We described distributions of reported SCIP adherence within each HRR, including medians, interquartile ranges (IQRs), skewness, and outliers.<h4>Principal findings</h4>Ninety-seven percent of HRRs had median SCIP-1 scores =95 percent. In 93 percent of HRRs, half of the hospitals in the HRR were within 5 percent of the median hospital's score. In 62 percent of HRRs, hospitals were skewed toward the higher rates (negative skewness). Seven percent of HRRs demonstrated positive skewness. Only 1 percent had a positive outlier. SCIP-2 and SCIP-3 demonstrated similar distributions.<h4>Conclusions</h4>Publicly reported quality measures for surgical site infection prevention do not distinguish the majority of hospitals that patients are likely to choose from when selecting a surgical provider.

24700317,Fast alignment-free sequence comparison using spaced-word frequencies.,"<h4>Motivation</h4>Alignment-free methods for sequence comparison are increasingly used for genome analysis and phylogeny reconstruction; they circumvent various difficulties of traditional alignment-based approaches. In particular, alignment-free methods are much faster than pairwise or multiple alignments. They are, however, less accurate than methods based on sequence alignment. Most alignment-free approaches work by comparing the word composition of sequences. A well-known problem with these methods is that neighbouring word matches are far from independent.<h4>Results</h4>To reduce the statistical dependency between adjacent word matches, we propose to use 'spaced words', defined by patterns of 'match' and 'don't care' positions, for alignment-free sequence comparison. We describe a fast implementation of this approach using recursive hashing and bit operations, and we show that further improvements can be achieved by using multiple patterns instead of single patterns. To evaluate our approach, we use spaced-word frequencies as a basis for fast phylogeny reconstruction. Using real-world and simulated sequence data, we demonstrate that our multiple-pattern approach produces better phylogenies than approaches relying on contiguous words.<h4>Availability and implementation</h4>Our program is freely available at http://spaced.gobics.de/.","kes, hji",0.0,0,0,2,0.0,,
24737859,"The influence of dynein processivity control, MAPs, and microtubule ends on directional movement of a localising mRNA.","Many cellular constituents travel along microtubules in association with multiple copies of motor proteins. How the activity of these motors is regulated during cargo sorting is poorly understood. In this study, we address this issue using a novel in vitro assay for the motility of localising Drosophila mRNAs bound to native dynein-dynactin complexes. High precision tracking reveals that individual RNPs within a population undergo either diffusive, or highly processive, minus end-directed movements along microtubules. RNA localisation signals stimulate the processive movements, with regulation of dynein-dynactin's activity rather than its total copy number per RNP, responsible for this effect. Our data support a novel mechanism for multi-motor translocation based on the regulation of dynein processivity by discrete cargo-associated features. Studying the in vitro responses of RNPs to microtubule-associated proteins (MAPs) and microtubule ends provides insights into how an RNA population could navigate the cytoskeletal network and become anchored at its destination in cells.

The goal of this study is to determine whether clinical cross-reactivity can be identified from primary protein sequences in allergy epitopes and food proteins.<h4>Methods</h4>High-throughput analysis was performed by assembling all known allergy epitopes within the Immune Epitope Database (IEDB; http://www.iedb.org) for 5 common species from 5 inhalant allergen subclasses and comparing their protein sequences to each other, as well as to sequences of intact proteins from known cross-reactive foods in the European Molecular Biology Laboratory-European Bioinformatics Institute (EMBL-EBI) protein database (http://www.uniprot.org) that have been implicated in OAS. Computational methods were employed to allow for exact matching, gaps, and similar amino acids using multiple algorithms. A phylogenetic tree was created to determine evolutionary relationships between cross-reactive epitopes in OAS.<h4>Results</h4>Twenty-three common inhalant allergens had 4429 unique epitopes; the 19 foods implicated in OAS had 9497 protein sequences. The Basic Local Alignment Search Tool (BLAST) algorithm identified interclass and intraclass sequence similarities for the 5 inhalant allergy classes with high similarity for mites, grasses, and trees. Analysis of OAS proteins identified 104 matches to inhalant allergy epitopes that are known to cross-react. The phylogenetic tree displayed relationships that mostly followed organism phylogeny.<h4>Conclusion</h4>Use of primary protein sequences was successful in explaining clinical allergy cross-reactivity. Clinical correlation is needed for use of these epitopes as diagnostic or therapeutic entities for patients with cross-reactive allergic disease.","kes, hji",0.0,0,0,2,0.0,,not about the resource

24861624,Enhancing UCSF Chimera through web services.,"Integrating access to web services with desktop applications allows for an expanded set of application features, including performing computationally intensive tasks and convenient searches of databases. We describe how we have enhanced UCSF Chimera (http://www.rbvi.ucsf.edu/chimera/), a program for the interactive visualization and analysis of molecular structures and related data, through the addition of several web services (http://www.rbvi.ucsf.edu/chimera/docs/webservices.html). By streamlining access to web services, including the entire job submission, monitoring and retrieval process, Chimera makes it simpler for users to focus on their science projects rather than data manipulation. Chimera uses Opal, a toolkit for wrapping scientific applications as web services, to provide scalable and transparent access to several popular software packages. We illustrate Chimera's use of web services with an example workflow that interleaves use of these services with interactive manipulation of molecular sequences and structures, and we provide an example Python program to demonstrate how easily Opal-based web services can be accessed from within an application.

24965847,H-DROP: an SVM based helical domain linker predictor trained with features optimized by combining random forest and stepwise selection.,"Domain linker prediction is attracting much interest as it can help identifying novel domains suitable for high throughput proteomics analysis. Here, we report H-DROP, an SVM-based Helical Domain linker pRediction using OPtimal features. H-DROP is, to the best of our knowledge, the first predictor for specifically and effectively identifying helical linkers. This was made possible first because a large training dataset became available from IS-Dom, and second because we selected a small number of optimal features from a huge number of potential ones. The training helical linker dataset, which included 261 helical linkers, was constructed by detecting helical residues at the boundary regions of two independent structural domains listed in our previously reported IS-Dom dataset. 45 optimal feature candidates were selected from 3,000 features by random forest, which were further reduced to 26 optimal features by stepwise selection. The prediction sensitivity and precision of H-DROP were 35.2 and 38.8%, respectively. These values were over 10.7% higher than those of control methods including our previously developed DROP, which is a coil linker predictor, and PPRODO, which is trained with un-differentiated domain boundary sequences. Overall, these results indicated that helical linkers can be predicted from sequence information alone by using a strictly curated training data set for helical linkers and carefully selected set of optimal features.

Findings from an international project.,"<h4>Background</h4>The 4-year (2007-2011) Revitalizing Health for All international research program (http://www.globalhealthequity.ca/projects/proj_revitalizing/index.shtml) supported 20 research teams located in 15 low- and middle-income countries to explore the strengths and weaknesses of comprehensive primary health care (CPHC) initiatives at their local or national levels. Teams were organized in a triad comprised of a senior researcher, a new researcher, and a 'research user' from government, health services, or other organizations with the authority or capacity to apply the research findings. Multiple regional and global team capacity-enhancement meetings were organized to refine methods and to discuss and assess cross-case findings.<h4>Objective</h4>Most research projects used mixed methods, incorporating analyses of qualitative data (interviews and focus groups), secondary data, and key policy and program documents. Some incorporated historical case study analyses, and a few undertook new surveys. The synthesis of findings in this report was derived through qualitative analysis of final project reports undertaken by three different reviewers.<h4>Results</h4>Evidence of comprehensiveness (defined in this research program as efforts to improve equity in access, community empowerment and participation, social and environmental health determinants, and intersectoral action) was found in many of the cases.<h4>Conclusions</h4>Despite the important contextual differences amongst the different country studies, the similarity of many of their findings, often generated using mixed methods, attests to certain transferable health systems characteristics to create and sustain CPHC practices. These include:1. Well-trained and supported community health workers (CHWs) able to work effectively with marginalized communities2. Effective mechanisms for community participation, both informal (through participation in projects and programs, and meaningful consultation) and formal (though program management structures)3. Co-partnership models in program and policy development (in which financial and knowledge supports from governments or institutions are provided to communities, which retain decision-making powers in program design and implementation)4. Support for community advocacy and engagement in health and social systems decision makingThese characteristics, in turn, require a political context that supports state responsibilities for redistributive health and social protection measures.","kes, hji",0.0,0,0,2,0.0,,
25161233,TEMPI: probabilistic modeling time-evolving differential PPI networks with multiPle information.,"<h4>Motivation</h4>Time-evolving differential protein-protein interaction (PPI) networks are essential to understand serial activation of differentially regulated (up- or downregulated) cellular processes (DRPs) and their interplays over time. Despite developments in the network inference, current methods are still limited in identifying temporal transition of structures of PPI networks, DRPs associated with the structural transition and the interplays among the DRPs over time.<h4>Results</h4>Here, we present a probabilistic model for estimating Time-Evolving differential PPI networks with MultiPle Information (TEMPI). This model describes probabilistic relationships among network structures, time-course gene expression data and Gene Ontology biological processes (GOBPs). By maximizing the likelihood of the probabilistic model, TEMPI estimates jointly the time-evolving differential PPI networks (TDNs) describing temporal transition of PPI network structures together with serial activation of DRPs associated with transiting networks. This joint estimation enables us to interpret the TDNs in terms of temporal transition of the DRPs. To demonstrate the utility of TEMPI, we applied it to two time-course datasets. TEMPI identified the TDNs that correctly delineated temporal transition of DRPs and time-dependent associations between the DRPs. These TDNs provide hypotheses for mechanisms underlying serial activation of key DRPs and their temporal associations.<h4>Availability and implementation</h4>Source code and sample data files are available at http://sbm.postech.ac.kr/tempi/sources.zip.<h4>Supplementary information</h4>Supplementary data are available at Bioinformatics online.","kes, hji",0.0,0,0,2,0.0,,sample data only
25161236,Effects of small particle numbers on long-term behaviour in discrete biochemical systems.,"<h4>Motivation</h4>The functioning of many biological processes depends on the appearance of only a small number of a single molecular species. Additionally, the observation of molecular crowding leads to the insight that even a high number of copies of species do not guarantee their interaction. How single particles contribute to stabilizing biological systems is not well understood yet. Hence, we aim at determining the influence of single molecules on the long-term behaviour of biological systems, i.e. whether they can reach a steady state.<h4>Results</h4>We provide theoretical considerations and a tool to analyse Systems Biology Markup Language models for the possibility to stabilize because of the described effects. The theory is an extension of chemical organization theory, which we called discrete chemical organization theory. Furthermore we scanned the BioModels Database for the occurrence of discrete chemical organizations. To exemplify our method, we describe an application to the Template model of the mitotic spindle assembly checkpoint mechanism.<h4>Availability and implementation</h4>http://www.biosys.uni-jena.de/Services.html.<h4>Supplementary information</h4>Supplementary data are available at Bioinformatics online.","kes, hji",0.0,0,0,2,0.0,,

These 'production' settings will require enhanced quality monitoring and quality control to optimize output and reduce costs. We developed SeqControl, a framework for predicting sequencing quality and coverage using a set of 15 metrics describing overall coverage, coverage distribution, basewise coverage and basewise quality. Using whole-genome sequences of 27 prostate cancers and 26 normal references, we derived multivariate models that predict sequencing quality and depth. SeqControl robustly predicted how much sequencing was required to reach a given coverage depth (area under the curve (AUC) = 0.993), accurately classified clinically relevant formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded samples, and made predictions from as little as one-eighth of a sequencing lane (AUC = 0.967). These techniques can be immediately incorporated into existing sequencing pipelines to monitor data quality in real time.

The 5th National Audit Project was designed to investigate the reported incidence, predisposing factors, causality and impact of accidental awareness. A nationwide network of local co-ordinators across all UK and Irish public hospitals reported all new patient reports of accidental awareness to a central database, using a system of monthly anonymised reporting over a calendar year. The database collected the details of the reported event, anaesthetic and surgical technique, and any sequelae. These reports were categorised into main types by a multidisciplinary panel, using a formalised process of analysis. The main categories of accidental awareness were: certain or probable; possible; during sedation; on or from the intensive care unit; could not be determined; unlikely; drug errors; and statement only. The degree of evidence to support the categorisation was also defined for each report. Patient experience and sequelae were categorised using current tools or modifications of such. The 5th National Audit Project methodology may be used to assess new reports of accidental awareness during general anaesthesia in a standardised manner, especially for the development of an ongoing database of case reporting.

25286919,Computing autocatalytic sets to unravel inconsistencies in metabolic network reconstructions.,"<h4>Motivation</h4>Genome-scale metabolic network reconstructions have been established as a powerful tool for the prediction of cellular phenotypes and metabolic capabilities of organisms. In recent years, the number of network reconstructions has been constantly increasing, mostly because of the availability of novel (semi-)automated procedures, which enabled the reconstruction of metabolic models based on individual genomes and their annotation. The resulting models are widely used in numerous applications. However, the accuracy and predictive power of network reconstructions are commonly limited by inherent inconsistencies and gaps.<h4>Results</h4>Here we present a novel method to validate metabolic network reconstructions based on the concept of autocatalytic sets. Autocatalytic sets correspond to collections of metabolites that, besides enzymes and a growth medium, are required to produce all biomass components in a metabolic model. These autocatalytic sets are well-conserved across all domains of life, and their identification in specific genome-scale reconstructions allows us to draw conclusions about potential inconsistencies in these models. The method is capable of detecting inconsistencies, which are neglected by other gap-finding methods. We tested our method on the Model SEED, which is the largest repository for automatically generated genome-scale network reconstructions. In this way, we were able to identify a significant number of missing pathways in several of these reconstructions. Hence, the method we report represents a powerful tool to identify inconsistencies in large-scale metabolic networks.<h4>Availability and implementation</h4>The method is available as source code on http://users.minet.uni-jena.de/~m3kach/ASBIG/ASBIG.zip.<h4>Contact</h4>christoph.kaleta@uni-jena.de<h4>Supplementary information</h4>Supplementary data are available at Bioinformatics online.","kes, hji",0.0,0,0,2,0.0,,
25329667,Accurate assignment of significance to neuropeptide identifications using Monte Carlo k-permuted decoy databases.,"In support of accurate neuropeptide identification in mass spectrometry experiments, novel Monte Carlo permutation testing was used to compute significance values. Testing was based on k-permuted decoy databases, where k denotes the number of permutations. These databases were integrated with a range of peptide identification indicators from three popular open-source database search software (OMSSA, Crux, and X! Tandem) to assess the statistical significance of neuropeptide spectra matches. Significance p-values were computed as the fraction of the sequences in the database with match indicator value better than or equal to the true target spectra. When applied to a test-bed of all known manually annotated mouse neuropeptides, permutation tests with k-permuted decoy databases identified up to 100% of the neuropeptides at p-value < 10(-5). The permutation test p-values using hyperscore (X! Tandem), E-value (OMSSA) and Sp score (Crux) match indicators outperformed all other match indicators. The robust performance to detect peptides of the intuitive indicator """"number of matched ions between the experimental and theoretical spectra"""" highlights the importance of considering this indicator when the p-value was borderline significant. Our findings suggest permutation decoy databases of size 1�105 are adequate to accurately detect neuropeptides and this can be exploited to increase the speed of the search. The straightforward Monte Carlo permutation testing (comparable to a zero order Markov model) can be easily combined with existing peptide identification software to enable accurate and effective neuropeptide detection.

25341068,"Udock, the interactive docking entertainment system.","Protein-protein interactions play a crucial role in biological processes. Protein docking calculations' goal is to predict, given two proteins of known structures, the associate conformation of the corresponding complex. Here, we present a new interactive protein docking system, Udock, that makes use of users' cognitive capabilities added up. In Udock, the users tackle simplified representations of protein structures and explore protein-protein interfaces' conformational space using a gamified interactive docking system with on the fly scoring. We assumed that if given appropriate tools, a na�ve user's cognitive capabilities could provide relevant data for (1) the prediction of correct interfaces in binary protein complexes and (2) the identification of the experimental partner in interaction among a set of decoys. To explore this approach experimentally, we conducted a preliminary two week long playtest where the registered users could perform a cross-docking on a dataset comprising 4 binary protein complexes. The users explored almost all the surface of the proteins that were available in the dataset but favored certain regions that seemed more attractive as potential docking spots. These favored regions were located inside or nearby the experimental binding interface for 5 out of the 8 proteins in the dataset. For most of them, the best scores were obtained with the experimental partner. The alpha version of Udock is freely accessible at http://udock.fr.","kes, hji",0.0,0,0,2,0.0,,
25344501,iDoComp: a compression scheme for assembled genomes.,"<h4>Motivation</h4>With the release of the latest next-generation sequencing (NGS) machine, the HiSeq X by Illumina, the cost of sequencing a Human has dropped to a mere $4000. Thus we are approaching a milestone in the sequencing history, known as the $1000 genome era, where the sequencing of individuals is affordable, opening the doors to effective personalized medicine. Massive generation of genomic data, including assembled genomes, is expected in the following years. There is crucial need for compression of genomes guaranteed of performing well simultaneously on different species, from simple bacteria to humans, which will ease their transmission, dissemination and analysis. Further, most of the new genomes to be compressed will correspond to individuals of a species from which a reference already exists on the database. Thus, it is natural to propose compression schemes that assume and exploit the availability of such references.<h4>Results</h4>We propose iDoComp, a compressor of assembled genomes presented in FASTA format that compresses an individual genome using a reference genome for both the compression and the decompression. In terms of compression efficiency, iDoComp outperforms previously proposed algorithms in most of the studied cases, with comparable or better running time. For example, we observe compression gains of up to 60% in several cases, including H.sapiens data, when comparing with the best compression performance among the previously proposed algorithms.<h4>Availability</h4>iDoComp is written in C and can be downloaded from: http://www.stanford.edu/~iochoa/iDoComp.html (We also provide a full explanation on how to run the program and an example with all the necessary files to run it.).","kes, hji",0.0,0,0,2,0.0,,

We present a web patient empowering system (PHSP4) that ensures continuous monitoring and assessment of the health state of patients with DM (type I and II). PHSP4 is a Knowledge-Based Personal Health System (PHS) which follows the trend of P4 Medicine (Personalized, Predictive, Preventive, and Participative). It provides messages to outpatients and clinicians about the achievement of objectives, follow-up, and treatments adjusted to the patient condition. Additionally, it calculates a four-component risk vector of the associated pathologies with DM: Nephropathy, Diabetic retinopathy, Diabetic foot, and Cardiovascular event. The core of the system is a Rule-Based System which Knowledge Base is composed by a set of rules implementing the recommendations of the American Diabetes Association (ADA) (American Diabetes Association: http://www.diabetes.org/ ) clinical guideline. The PHSP4 is designed to be standardized and to facilitate its interoperability by means of terminologies (SNOMED-CT [The International Health Terminology Standards Development Organization: http://www.ihtsdo.org/snomed-ct/ ] and UCUM [The Unified Code for Units of Measure: http://unitsofmeasure.org/ ]), standardized clinical documents (HL7 CDA R2 [Health Level Seven International: http://www.hl7.org/index.cfm ]) for managing Electronic Health Record (EHR).

25429060,A bio-inspired computing model for ovarian carcinoma classification and oncogene detection.,"<h4>Motivation</h4>Ovarian cancer is the fifth leading cause of cancer deaths in women in the western world for 2013. In ovarian cancer, benign tumors turn malignant, but the point of transition is difficult to predict and diagnose. The 5-year survival rate of all types of ovarian cancer is 44%, but this can be improved to 92% if the cancer is found and treated before it spreads beyond the ovary. However, only 15% of all ovarian cancers are found at this early stage. Therefore, the ability to automatically identify and diagnose ovarian cancer precisely and efficiently as the tissue changes from benign to invasive is important for clinical treatment and for increasing the cure rate. This study proposes a new ovarian carcinoma classification model using two algorithms: a novel discretization of food sources for an artificial bee colony (DfABC), and a support vector machine (SVM). For the first time in the literature, oncogene detection using this method is also investigated.<h4>Results</h4>A novel bio-inspired computing model and hybrid algorithms combining DfABC and SVM was applied to ovarian carcinoma and oncogene classification. This study used the human ovarian cDNA expression database to collect 41 patient samples and 9600 genes in each pathological stage. Feature selection methods were used to detect and extract 15 notable oncogenes. We then used the DfABC-SVM model to examine these 15 oncogenes, dividing them into eight different classifications according to their gene expressions of various pathological stages. The average accuracyof the eight classification experiments was 94.76%. This research also found some oncogenes that had not been discovered or indicated in previous scientific studies. The main contribution of this research is the proof that these newly discovered oncogenes are highly related to ovarian or other cancers.<h4>Availability and implementation</h4>http://mht.mis.nchu.edu.tw/moodle/course/view.php?id=7.","kes, hji",0.0,0,0,2,0.0,,

25480679,Marky: a tool supporting annotation consistency in multi-user and iterative document annotation projects.,"<h4>Background and objectives</h4>Document annotation is a key task in the development of Text Mining methods and applications. High quality annotated corpora are invaluable, but their preparation requires a considerable amount of resources and time. Although the existing annotation tools offer good user interaction interfaces to domain experts, project management and quality control abilities are still limited. Therefore, the current work introduces Marky, a new Web-based document annotation tool equipped to manage multi-user and iterative projects, and to evaluate annotation quality throughout the project life cycle.<h4>Methods</h4>At the core, Marky is a Web application based on the open source CakePHP framework. User interface relies on HTML5 and CSS3 technologies. Rangy library assists in browser-independent implementation of common DOM range and selection tasks, and Ajax and JQuery technologies are used to enhance user-system interaction.<h4>Results</h4>Marky grants solid management of inter- and intra-annotator work. Most notably, its annotation tracking system supports systematic and on-demand agreement analysis and annotation amendment. Each annotator may work over documents as usual, but all the annotations made are saved by the tracking system and may be further compared. So, the project administrator is able to evaluate annotation consistency among annotators and across rounds of annotation, while annotators are able to reject or amend subsets of annotations made in previous rounds. As a side effect, the tracking system minimises resource and time consumption.<h4>Conclusions</h4>Marky is a novel environment for managing multi-user and iterative document annotation projects. Compared to other tools, Marky offers a similar visually intuitive annotation experience while providing unique means to minimise annotation effort and enforce annotation quality, and therefore corpus consistency.

However, the necessary harmonization of genetic datasets is currently error-prone because of many different file formats and lack of clarity about which genomic strand is used as reference.<h4>Findings</h4>Genotype Harmonizer (GH) is a command-line tool to harmonize genetic datasets by automatically solving issues concerning genomic strand and file format. GH solves the unknown strand issue by aligning ambiguous A/T and G/C SNPs to a specified reference, using linkage disequilibrium patterns without prior knowledge of the used strands. GH supports many common GWAS/NGS genotype formats including PLINK, binary PLINK, VCF, SHAPEIT2 & Oxford GEN. GH is implemented in Java and a large part of the functionality can also be used as Java 'Genotype-IO' API. All software is open source under license LGPLv3 and available from http://www.molgenis.org/systemsgenetics.<h4>Conclusions</h4>GH can be used to harmonize genetic datasets across different file formats and can be easily integrated as a step in routine meta-analysis and imputation pipelines.","kes, hji",0.0,0,0,2,0.0,,
25561511,Genomic classifier ColoPrint predicts recurrence in stage II colorectal cancer patients more accurately than clinical factors.,"<h4>Background</h4>Approximately 20% of patients with stage II colorectal cancer will experience a relapse. Current clinical-pathologic stratification factors do not allow clear identification of these high-risk patients. ColoPrint (Agendia, Amsterdam, The Netherlands, http://www.agendia.com) is a gene expression classifier that distinguishes patients with low or high risk of disease relapse.<h4>Methods</h4>ColoPrint was developed using whole-genome expression data and validated in several independent validation cohorts. Stage II patients from these studies were pooled (n = 416), and ColoPrint was compared with clinical risk factors described in the National Comprehensive Cancer Network (NCCN) 2013 Guidelines for Colon Cancer. Median follow-up was 81 months. Most patients (70%) did not receive adjuvant chemotherapy. Risk of relapse (ROR) was defined as survival until first event of recurrence or death from cancer.<h4>Results</h4>In the pooled stage II data set, ColoPrint identified 63% of patients as low risk with a 5-year ROR of 10%, whereas high-risk patients (37%) had a 5-year ROR of 21%, with a hazard ratio (HR) of 2.16 (p = .004). This remained significant in a multivariate model that included number of lymph nodes retrieved and microsatellite instability. In the T3 microsatellite-stable subgroup (n = 301), ColoPrint classified 59% of patients as low risk with a 5-year ROR of 9.9%. High-risk patients (31%) had a 22.4% ROR (HR: 2.41; p = .005). In contrast, the NCCN clinical high-risk factors were unable to distinguish high- and low-risk patients (15% vs. 13% ROR; p = .55).<h4>Conclusion</h4>ColoPrint significantly improved prognostic accuracy independent of microsatellite status or clinical variables, facilitating the identification of patients at higher risk who might be considered for additional treatment.","kes, hji",0.0,0,0,2,0.0,,
25643357,Figure-associated text summarization and evaluation.,"Biomedical literature incorporates millions of figures, which are a rich and important knowledge resource for biomedical researchers. Scientists need access to the figures and the knowledge they represent in order to validate research findings and to generate new hypotheses. By themselves, these figures are nearly always incomprehensible to both humans and machines and their associated texts are therefore essential for full comprehension. The associated text of a figure, however, is scattered throughout its full-text article and contains redundant information content. In this paper, we report the continued development and evaluation of several figure summarization systems, the FigSum+ systems, that automatically identify associated texts, remove redundant information, and generate a text summary for every figure in an article. Using a set of 94 annotated figures selected from 19 different journals, we conducted an intrinsic evaluation of FigSum+. We evaluate the performance by precision, recall, F1, and ROUGE scores. The best FigSum+ system is based on an unsupervised method, achieving F1 score of 0.66 and ROUGE-1 score of 0.97.

25687422,Mega2: validated data-reformatting for linkage and association analyses.,"BACKGROUND:In a typical study of the genetics of a complex human disease, many different analysis programs are used, to test for linkage and association. This requires extensive and careful data reformatting, as many of these analysis programs use differing input formats. Writing scripts to facilitate this can be tedious, time-consuming, and error-prone. To address these issues, the open source Mega2 data reformatting program provides validated and tested data conversions from several commonly-used input formats to many output formats. RESULTS:Mega2, the Manipulation Environment for Genetic Analysis, facilitates the creation of analysis-ready datasets from data gathered as part of a genetic study. It transparently allows users to process genetic data for family-based or case/control studies accurately and efficiently. In addition to data validation checks, Mega2 provides analysis setup capabilities for a broad choice of commonly-used genetic analysis programs. First released in 2000, Mega2 has recently been significantly improved in a number of ways. We have rewritten it in C++ and have reduced its memory requirements. Mega2 now can read input files in LINKAGE, PLINK, and VCF/BCF formats, as well as its own specialized annotated format. It supports conversion to many commonly-used formats including SOLAR, PLINK, Merlin, Mendel, SimWalk2, Cranefoot, IQLS, FBAT, MORGAN, BEAGLE, Eigenstrat, Structure, and PLINK/SEQ. When controlled by a batch file, Mega2 can be used non-interactively in data reformatting pipelines. Support for genetic data from several other species besides humans has been added. CONCLUSIONS:By providing tested and validated data reformatting, Mega2 facilitates more accurate and extensive analyses of genetic data, avoiding the need to write, debug, and maintain one's own custom data reformatting scripts.

25725090,SimSeq: a nonparametric approach to simulation of RNA-sequence datasets.,"<h4>Motivation</h4>RNA sequencing analysis methods are often derived by relying on hypothetical parametric models for read counts that are not likely to be precisely satisfied in practice. Methods are often tested by analyzing data that have been simulated according to the assumed model. This testing strategy can result in an overly optimistic view of the performance of an RNA-seq analysis method.<h4>Results</h4>We develop a data-based simulation algorithm for RNA-seq data. The vector of read counts simulated for a given experimental unit has a joint distribution that closely matches the distribution of a source RNA-seq dataset provided by the user. We conduct simulation experiments based on the negative binomial distribution and our proposed nonparametric simulation algorithm. We compare performance between the two simulation experiments over a small subset of statistical methods for RNA-seq analysis available in the literature. We use as a benchmark the ability of a method to control the false discovery rate.

However, assembling sequencing data from virus samples, especially RNA viruses, into a genome sequence is challenging due to the combination of viral population diversity and extremely uneven read depth caused by amplification bias in the inevitable reverse transcription and polymerase chain reaction amplification process of current methods.<h4>Results</h4>We developed a new de novo assembler called IVA (Iterative Virus Assembler) designed specifically for read pairs sequenced at highly variable depth from RNA virus samples. We tested IVA on datasets from 140 sequenced samples from human immunodeficiency virus-1 or influenza-virus-infected people and demonstrated that IVA outperforms all other virus de novo assemblers.<h4>Availability and implementation</h4>The software runs under Linux, has the GPLv3 licence and is freely available from http://sanger-pathogens.github.io/iva","kes, hji",0.0,0,0,2,0.0,,

The co-expression patterns of DSCR genes in brain were calculated by using multivariate statistical methods.<h4>Results</h4>Highest levels of gene expression were registered at caudate nucleus, nucleus accumbens and putamen among central areas of cerebral cortex. Increased expression levels of RCAN1 that encode by a protein involved in signal transduction process of the CNS were recorded for PCP4 that participates in the binding to calmodulin and TTC3; a protein that is associated with differentiation of neurons. That previously identified brain structures play a crucial role in the learning process, in different class of memory and in motor skills.<h4>Conclusion</h4>The precise regulation of DSCR gene expression is crucial to maintain the brain homeostasis, especially in those areas with high levels of gene expression associated with a remarkable process of learning and cognition.","kes, hji",0.0,0,0,2,0.0,,not about the resource

It provides instantaneous processing of the 3-D movement coordinates of up to 20 markers at a single instant. Available functions include (1) the setting of reference positions, areas, and trajectories of interest; (2) recording of the 3-D coordinates for each marker over the trial duration; and (3) the detection of events to use as triggers for external reinforcers (e.g., lights, sounds, or odors). Through fast online communication between the hardware controller and RTMocap, automatic trial selection is possible by means of either a preset or an adaptive criterion. Rapid preprocessing of signals is also provided, which includes artifact rejection, filtering, spline interpolation, and averaging. A key example is detailed, and three typical variations are developed (1) to provide a clear understanding of the importance of real-time control for 3-D motion in cognitive sciences and (2) to present users with simple lines of code that can be used as starting points for customizing experiments using the simple MATLAB syntax.

25855375,Alterations of Functional Connectivity Among Resting-State Networks in Hypothyroidism.,"Hypothyroidism affects brain functioning as suggested by various neuroimaging studies. The primary focus of the present study was to examine whether hypothyroidism would impact connectivity among resting-state networks (RSNs) using resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging (rsfMRI). Twenty-two patients with hypothyroidism and 22 healthy controls were recruited and scanned using rsfMRI. The data were analysed using independent component analysis and a dual regression approach that was applied on five RSNs that were identified using fsl software (http://fsl.fmrib.ox.ac.uk). Hypothyroid patients showed significantly decreased functional connectivity in the regions of the right frontoparietal network (frontal pole), the medial visual network (lateral occipital gyrus, precuneus cortex and cuneus) and the motor network (precentral gyrus, postcentral gyrus, precuneus cortex, paracingulate gyrus, cingulate gyrus and supramarginal gyrus) compared to healthy controls. The reduced functional connectivity in the right frontoparietal network, the medial visual network and the motor network suggests neurocognitive alterations in hypothyroid patients in the corresponding functions. However, the study would be further continued to investigate the effects of thyroxine treatment and correlation with neurocognitive scores. The findings of the present study provide further interesting insights into our understanding of the action of thyroid hormone on the adult human brain.","kes, hji",0.0,0,0,2,0.0,,
25855811,SANSparallel: interactive homology search against Uniprot.,"Proteins evolve by mutations and natural selection. The network of sequence similarities is a rich source for mining homologous relationships that inform on protein structure and function. There are many servers available to browse the network of homology relationships but one has to wait up to a minute for results. The SANSparallel webserver provides protein sequence database searches with immediate response and professional alignment visualization by third-party software. The output is a list, pairwise alignment or stacked alignment of sequence-similar proteins from Uniprot, UniRef90/50, Swissprot or Protein Data Bank. The stacked alignments are viewed in Jalview or as sequence logos. The database search uses the suffix array neighborhood search (SANS) method, which has been re-implemented as a client-server, improved and parallelized. The method is extremely fast and as sensitive as BLAST above 50% sequence identity. Benchmarks show that the method is highly competitive compared to previously published fast database search programs: UBLAST, DIAMOND, LAST, LAMBDA, RAPSEARCH2 and BLAT. The web server can be accessed interactively or programmatically at http://ekhidna2.biocenter.helsinki.fi/cgi-bin/sans/sans.cgi. It can be used to make protein functional annotation pipelines more efficient, and it is useful in interactive exploration of the detailed evidence supporting the annotation of particular proteins of interest.","kes, hji",0.0,0,0,2,0.0,,
25861968,MetaSV: an accurate and integrative structural-variant caller for next generation sequencing.,"<h4>Unlabelled</h4>Structural variations (SVs) are large genomic rearrangements that vary significantly in size, making them challenging to detect with the relatively short reads from next-generation sequencing (NGS). Different SV detection methods have been developed; however, each is limited to specific kinds of SVs with varying accuracy and resolution. Previous works have attempted to combine different methods, but they still suffer from poor accuracy particularly for insertions. We propose MetaSV, an integrated SV caller which leverages multiple orthogonal SV signals for high accuracy and resolution. MetaSV proceeds by merging SVs from multiple tools for all types of SVs. It also analyzes soft-clipped reads from alignment to detect insertions accurately since existing tools underestimate insertion SVs. Local assembly in combination with dynamic programming is used to improve breakpoint resolution. Paired-end and coverage information is used to predict SV genotypes. Using simulation and experimental data, we demonstrate the effectiveness of MetaSV across various SV types and sizes.<h4>Availability and implementation</h4>Code in Python is at http://bioinform.github.io/metasv/.<h4>Contact</h4>rd@bina.com<h4>Supplementary information</h4>Supplementary data are available at Bioinformatics online.","kes, hji",0.0,0,0,2,0.0,,

The specimens were radiographed using a charge-coupled device sensor along with an 11-step aluminum step wedge (1.5-mm incremental steps) and 1-mm-thick tooth cut using five tube voltage/exposure time setups (60 kVp, 0.10/0.08 seconds; 70 kVp, 0.10/0.08/0.06 seconds) at 4 mA and 30 cm. The radiopacity of the specimens was compared with that of the aluminum step wedge and human enamel and dentin using NIH ImageJ software (available at http://rsb.info.nih.gov/ij/). A linear regression model for the aluminum step wedge was constructed, and the data were analyzed by ANOVA and Duncan post hoc test.<h4>Results</h4>Maxcem Elite (5.142 to 5.441) showed the highest radiopacity of all materials, followed in order by Multilink Speed (3.731 to 3.396) and V-link (2.763 to 3.103). The radiopacity of Panavia F 2.0 (2.025 to 2.429), BisCem (1.825 to 2.218), Clearfil SA Luting (1.692 to 2.145), Duolink (1.707 to 1.993), and RelyX Unicem Clicker (1.586 to 1.979) were between enamel (2.117 to 2.330) and dentin (1.302 to 1.685). The radiopacity of 70 kVp conditions was higher than that of the 60 kVp conditions.<h4>Conclusions</h4>The radiopacities of the tested luting materials were greater than those of dentin or aluminum, satisfying the criteria of the International Organization for Standardization, and they differed significantly from each other in the exposure setups.","kes, hji",0.0,0,0,2,0.0,,
25871442,Monitoring matrix metalloproteinase activity at the epidermal-dermal interface by SILAC-iTRAQ-TAILS.,"Secreted proteases act on interstitial tissue secretomes released from multiple cell types. Thus, substrate proteins might be part of higher molecular complexes constituted by many proteins with diverse and potentially unknown cellular origin. In cell culture, these may be reconstituted by mixing native secretomes from different cell types prior to incubation with a test protease. Although current degradomics techniques could identify novel substrate proteins in these complexes, all information on the cellular origin is lost. To address this limitation, we combined iTRAQ-based terminal amine isotopic labeling of substrates (iTRAQ-TAILS) with SILAC to assign proteins to a specific cell type by MS1- and their cleavage by MS2-based quantification in the same experiment. We demonstrate the power of our newly established workflow by monitoring matrix metalloproteinase (MMP) 10 dependent cleavages in mixtures from light-labeled keratinocyte and heavy-labeled fibroblast secretomes. This analysis correctly assigned extracellular matrix components, such as laminins and collagens, to their respective cellular origins and revealed their processing in an MMP10-dependent manner. Hence, our newly devised degradomics workflow facilitates deeper insight into protease activity in complex intercellular compartments such as the epidermal-dermal interface by integrating multiple modes of quantification with positional proteomics.

25882789,ReMo-SNPs: a new software tool for identification of polymorphisms in regions and motifs genome-wide.,"Studies of complex genetic diseases have revealed many risk factors of small effect, but the combined amount of heritability explained is still low. Genome-wide association studies are often underpowered to identify true effects because of the very large number of parallel tests. There is, therefore, a great need to generate data sets that are enriched for those markers that have an increased a priori chance of being functional, such as markers in genomic regions involved in gene regulation. ReMo-SNPs is a computational program developed to aid researchers in the process of selecting functional SNPs for association analyses in user-specified regions and/or motifs genome-wide. The useful feature of automatic selection of genotyped markers in the user-provided material makes the output data ready to be used in a following association study. In this article we describe the program and its functions. We also validate the program by including an example study on three different transcription factors and results from an association study on two psychiatric phenotypes. The flexibility of the ReMo-SNPs program enables the user to study any region or sequence of interest, without limitation to transcription factor binding regions and motifs.

25886978,Accurate prediction of RNA nucleotide interactions with backbone k-tree model.,"<h4>Motivation</h4>Given the importance of non-coding RNAs to cellular regulatory functions, it would be highly desirable to have accurate computational prediction of RNA 3D structure, a task which remains challenging. Even for a short RNA sequence, the space of tertiary conformations is immense; existing methods to identify native-like conformations mostly resort to random sampling of conformations to achieve computational feasibility. However, native conformations may not be examined and prediction accuracy may be compromised due to sampling. State-of-the-art methods have yet to deliver satisfactory predictions for RNAs of length beyond 50 nucleotides.<h4>Results</h4>This paper presents a method to tackle a key step in the RNA 3D structure prediction problem, the prediction of the nucleotide interactions that constitute the desired 3D structure. The research is based on a novel graph model, called a backbone k-tree, to tightly constrain the nucleotide interaction relationships considered for RNA 3D structures. It is shown that the new model makes it possible to efficiently predict the optimal set of nucleotide interactions (including the non-canonical interactions in all recently revealed families) from the query sequence along with known or predicted canonical basepairs. The preliminary results indicate that in most cases the new method can predict with a high accuracy the nucleotide interactions that constitute the 3D structure of the query sequence. It thus provides a useful tool for the accurate prediction of RNA 3D structure.<h4>Availability and implementation</h4>The source package for BkTree is available at http://rna-informatics.uga.edu/index.php?f=software&p=BkTree.<h4>Contact</h4>lding@uga.edu or cai@cs.uga.edu<h4>Supplementary information</h4>Supplementary data are available at Bioinformatics online.","kes, hji",0.0,0,0,2,0.0,,
25887233,Kernel approaches for differential expression analysis of mass spectrometry-based metabolomics data.,"<h4>Background</h4>Data generated from metabolomics experiments are different from other types of """"-omics"""" data. For example, a common phenomenon in mass spectrometry (MS)-based metabolomics data is that the data matrix frequently contains missing values, which complicates some quantitative analyses. One way to tackle this problem is to treat them as absent. Hence there are two types of information that are available in metabolomics data: presence/absence of a metabolite and a quantitative value of the abundance level of a metabolite if it is present. Combining these two layers of information poses challenges to the application of traditional statistical approaches in differential expression analysis.<h4>Results</h4>In this article, we propose a novel kernel-based score test for the metabolomics differential expression analysis. In order to simultaneously capture both the continuous pattern and discrete pattern in metabolomics data, two new kinds of kernels are designed. One is the distance-based kernel and the other is the stratified kernel. While we initially describe the procedures in the case of single-metabolite analysis, we extend the methods to handle metabolite sets as well.<h4>Conclusions</h4>Evaluation based on both simulated data and real data from a liver cancer metabolomics study indicates that our kernel method has a better performance than some existing alternatives.

Therefore, a variant calling algorithm for calling low-frequency polymorphisms in heterogeneous samples is needed.<h4>Results</h4>We present a novel variant calling algorithm that uses a hierarchical Bayesian model to estimate allele frequency and call variants in heterogeneous samples. We show that our algorithm improves upon current classifiers and has higher sensitivity and specificity over a wide range of median read depth and minor allele fraction.

25952609,Heterozygous genome assembly via binary classification of homologous sequence.,"<h4>Background</h4>Genome assemblers to date have predominantly targeted haploid reference reconstruction from homozygous data. When applied to diploid genome assembly, these assemblers perform poorly, owing to the violation of assumptions during both the contigging and scaffolding phases. Effective tools to overcome these problems are in growing demand. Increasing parameter stringency during contigging is an effective solution to obtaining haplotype-specific contigs; however, effective algorithms for scaffolding such contigs are lacking.<h4>Methods</h4>We present a stand-alone scaffolding algorithm, ScaffoldScaffolder, designed specifically for scaffolding diploid genomes. The algorithm identifies homologous sequences as found in """"bubble"""" structures in scaffold graphs. Machine learning classification is used to then classify sequences in partial bubbles as homologous or non-homologous sequences prior to reconstructing haplotype-specific scaffolds. We define four new metrics for assessing diploid scaffolding accuracy: contig sequencing depth, contig homogeneity, phase group homogeneity, and heterogeneity between phase groups.<h4>Results</h4>We demonstrate the viability of using bubbles to identify heterozygous homologous contigs, which we term homolotigs. We show that machine learning classification trained on these homolotig pairs can be used effectively for identifying homologous sequences elsewhere in the data with high precision (assuming error-free reads).<h4>Conclusion</h4>More work is required to comparatively analyze this approach on real data with various parameters and classifiers against other diploid genome assembly methods. However, the initial results of ScaffoldScaffolder supply validity to the idea of employing machine learning in the difficult task of diploid genome assembly.

Collaboration with environmental health science through team projects has advanced and improved our understanding of environmental health and justice.<h4>Objective</h4>We sought to identify diverse methods and topics in which social scientists have expanded environmental health understandings at multiple levels, to examine how transdisciplinary environmental health research fosters better science, and to learn how these partnerships have been able to flourish because of the support from National Institute of Environmental Health Sciences (NIEHS).<h4>Methods</h4>We analyzed various types of social science research to investigate how social science contributes to environmental health. We also examined NIEHS programs that foster social science. In addition, we developed a case study of a community-based participation research project in Akwesasne in order to demonstrate how social science has enhanced environmental health science.<h4>Results</h4>Social science has informed environmental health science through ethnographic studies of contaminated communities, analysis of spatial distribution of environmental injustice, psychological experience of contamination, social construction of risk and risk perception, and social impacts of disasters. Social science-environmental health team science has altered the way scientists traditionally explore exposure by pressing for cumulative exposure approaches and providing research data for policy applications.<h4>Conclusions</h4>A transdisciplinary approach for environmental health practice has emerged that engages the social sciences to paint a full picture of the consequences of contamination so that policy makers, regulators, public health officials, and other stakeholders can better ameliorate impacts and prevent future exposure.<h4>Citation</h4>Hoover E, Renauld M, Edelstein MR, Brown P. 2015.

25987413,A Scalable Approach for Protein False Discovery Rate Estimation in Large Proteomic Data Sets.,"Calculating the number of confidently identified proteins and estimating false discovery rate (FDR) is a challenge when analyzing very large proteomic data sets such as entire human proteomes. Biological and technical heterogeneity in proteomic experiments further add to the challenge and there are strong differences in opinion regarding the conceptual validity of a protein FDR and no consensus regarding the methodology for protein FDR determination. There are also limitations inherent to the widely used classic target-decoy strategy that particularly show when analyzing very large data sets and that lead to a strong over-representation of decoy identifications. In this study, we investigated the merits of the classic, as well as a novel target-decoy-based protein FDR estimation approach, taking advantage of a heterogeneous data collection comprised of ~19,000 LC-MS/MS runs deposited in ProteomicsDB (https://www.proteomicsdb.org). The """"picked"""" protein FDR approach treats target and decoy sequences of the same protein as a pair rather than as individual entities and chooses either the target or the decoy sequence depending on which receives the highest score. We investigated the performance of this approach in combination with q-value based peptide scoring to normalize sample-, instrument-, and search engine-specific differences. The """"picked"""" target-decoy strategy performed best when protein scoring was based on the best peptide q-value for each protein yielding a stable number of true positive protein identifications over a wide range of q-value thresholds. We show that this simple and unbiased strategy eliminates a conceptual issue in the commonly used """"classic"""" protein FDR approach that causes overprediction of false-positive protein identification in large data sets. The approach scales from small to very large data sets without losing performance, consistently increases the number of true-positive protein identifications and is readily implemented in proteomics analysis software.","kes, hji",0.0,0,0,2,0.0,,

26051252,Light-weight reference-based compression of FASTQ data.,"<h4>Background</h4>The exponential growth of next generation sequencing (NGS) data has posed big challenges to data storage, management and archive. Data compression is one of the effective solutions, where reference-based compression strategies can typically achieve superior compression ratios compared to the ones not relying on any reference.<h4>Results</h4>This paper presents a lossless light-weight reference-based compression algorithm namely LW-FQZip to compress FASTQ data. The three components of any given input, i.e., metadata, short reads and quality score strings, are first parsed into three data streams in which the redundancy information are identified and eliminated independently. Particularly, well-designed incremental and run-length-limited encoding schemes are utilized to compress the metadata and quality score streams, respectively. To handle the short reads, LW-FQZip uses a novel light-weight mapping model to fast map them against external reference sequence(s) and produce concise alignment results for storage. The three processed data streams are then packed together with some general purpose compression algorithms like LZMA. LW-FQZip was evaluated on eight real-world NGS data sets and achieved compression ratios in the range of 0.111-0.201. This is comparable or superior to other state-of-the-art lossless NGS data compression algorithms.<h4>Conclusions</h4>LW-FQZip is a program that enables efficient lossless FASTQ data compression. It contributes to the state of art applications for NGS data storage and transmission. LW-FQZip is freely available online at: http://csse.szu.edu.cn/staff/zhuzx/LWFQZip.","kes, hji",0.0,0,0,2,0.0,,

Various data processing methods have been developed for exploring the resultant high volume data. However, most of these methods process data in the spectral domain and do not make the most of the important spatial information available through this technology. Therefore, we propose a novel streamlined data analysis pipeline specifically developed for MALDI-IMS data utilizing significant spatial information for identifying hidden significant molecular distribution patterns in these complex datasets.<h4>Methods</h4>The proposed unsupervised algorithm uses Sliding Window Normalization (SWN) and a new spatial distribution based peak picking method developed based on Gray level Co-Occurrence (GCO) matrices followed by clustering of biomolecules. We also use gist descriptors and an improved version of GCO matrices to extract features from molecular images and minimum medoid distance to automatically estimate the number of possible groups.<h4>Results</h4>We evaluated our algorithm using a new MALDI-IMS metabolomics dataset of a plant (Eucalypt) leaf. The algorithm revealed hidden significant molecular distribution patterns in the dataset, which the current Component Analysis and Segmentation Map based approaches failed to extract. We further demonstrate the performance of our peak picking method over other traditional approaches by using a publicly available MALDI-IMS proteomics dataset of a rat brain. Although SWN did not show any significant improvement as compared with using no normalization, the visual assessment showed an improvement as compared to using the median normalization.<h4>Availability and implementation</h4>The source code and sample data are freely available at http://exims.sourceforge.net/.<h4>Contact</h4>awgcdw@student.unimelb.edu.au or chalini_w@live.com<h4>Supplementary information</h4>Supplementary data are available at Bioinformatics online.","kes, hji",0.0,0,0,2,0.0,,

The two current approaches to the analysis of antibody repertoires [next generation sequencing (NGS) and mass spectrometry (MS)] present difficult computational challenges since antibodies are not directly encoded in the germline but are extensively diversified by somatic recombination and hypermutations. Therefore, the protein database required for the interpretation of spectra from circulating antibodies is custom for each individual. Although such a database can be constructed via NGS, the reads generated by NGS are error-prone and even a single nucleotide error precludes identification of a peptide by the standard proteomics tools.

We derive a combinatorial characterization of the solutions to this problem and show that the problem is NP-complete. We derive an integer linear programming solution to the VAF factorization problem in the case of error-free data and extend this solution to real data with a probabilistic model for errors. The resulting AncesTree algorithm is better able to identify ancestral relationships between individual mutations than existing approaches, particularly in ultra-deep sequencing data when high read counts for mutations yield high confidence VAFs.<h4>Availability and implementation</h4>An implementation of AncesTree is available at: http://compbio.cs.brown.edu/software.","kes, hji",0.0,0,0,2,0.0,,
26072515,Inferring orthologous gene regulatory networks using interspecies data fusion.,"<h4>Motivation</h4>The ability to jointly learn gene regulatory networks (GRNs) in, or leverage GRNs between related species would allow the vast amount of legacy data obtained in model organisms to inform the GRNs of more complex, or economically or medically relevant counterparts. Examples include transferring information from Arabidopsis thaliana into related crop species for food security purposes, or from mice into humans for medical applications. Here we develop two related Bayesian approaches to network inference that allow GRNs to be jointly inferred in, or leveraged between, several related species: in one framework, network information is directly propagated between species; in the second hierarchical approach, network information is propagated via an unobserved 'hypernetwork'. In both frameworks, information about network similarity is captured via graph kernels, with the networks additionally informed by species-specific time series gene expression data, when available, using Gaussian processes to model the dynamics of gene expression.<h4>Results</h4>Results on in silico benchmarks demonstrate that joint inference, and leveraging of known networks between species, offers better accuracy than standalone inference. The direct propagation of network information via the non-hierarchical framework is more appropriate when there are relatively few species, while the hierarchical approach is better suited when there are many species. Both methods are robust to small amounts of mislabelling of orthologues. Finally, the use of Saccharomyces cerevisiae data and networks to inform inference of networks in the budding yeast Schizosaccharomyces pombe predicts a novel role in cell cycle regulation for Gas1 (SPAC19B12.02c), a 1,3-beta-glucanosyltransferase.<h4>Availability and implementation</h4>MATLAB code is available from http://go.warwick.ac.uk/systemsbiology/software/.","kes, hji",0.0,0,0,2,0.0,,

Other animal and human studies link chemical exposures to increased breast cancer rates, including two recent investigations focused on occupational hazards. But the latter are the exception. Studies that attempt to identify and characterize workplace agents linked to breast cancer, as well as intervention studies focusing on the use of less toxic processes and substances, are limited. In what might be construed as a case of gender and social class bias, many research and funding agencies have ignored or downplayed the role of occupational studies despite their relevance to prevention efforts. Action required starts with making a national priority of promoting and supporting research on occupational and other environmental causes of breast cancer. Other public health actions include hazard surveillance and primary prevention activities such as reductions in the use of toxic materials, informed substitution, and green chemistry efforts.

26095248,"Advocating for Deployed Women Veterans' Health Differences, Difficulties, and Disparities.","<h4>Problem</h4>The preceding article presented a glimpse of deployed women veterans, their military culture, and their experiences in the Global War on Terror (Iraq and Afghanistan) to assist civilian nurses to gain significant rapport and provide important culturally sensitive care.<h4>Methods</h4>Pertinent literary sources were reviewed to gather applicable data about the problem.<h4>Findings</h4>A confirmatory answer from the assessment question of """"Have you served in the military?"""" and the use of the Military Health History Pocket Card for Clinicians (available at http://www.va.gov.oaa/pocketcard) will assist with revealing possible health risks from the increased amounts of military men and women veterans seeking (and/or returning to) a variety of community-based health services. This article about deployed women veterans examines their specific health differences (e.g., research literature, post-traumatic stress disorder, and military sexual trauma), difficulties (e.g., reproductive, gynecologic, urinary, suicide), and gender disparities (varied treatment patterns).<h4>Conclusion</h4>Understanding these gender situations, civilian nurses can better advocate with increasing evidence-based decisions that their physical and behavioral responses were different from their male counterparts. Continual assessment, knowledgeable care, ongoing literature review, interdisciplinary health team development, and the presence of resourceful community agencies should be a significant part of their holistic care.

26106259,MITOSCISSOR: A Useful Tool for Auto-Assembly of Mitogenomic Datasets in the Evolutionary Analysis of Fishes.,"As a result of the development of rapid and efficient sequencing technologies, complete sequences of numerous mitochondrial genomes are now available. Mitochondrial genomes have been widely used to evaluate relationships between species in several fields, including evolutionary and population genetics, as well as in forensic identification and in the study of mitochondrial diseases in humans. However, the creation of mitochondrial genomes is extremely time consuming. In this paper, we present a new tool, MITOSCISSOR, which is a rapid method for parsing and formatting dozens of complete mitochondrial genome sequences. With the aid of MITOSCISSOR, complete mitochondrial genome sequences of 103 species from Tetraodontiformes (a difficult-to-classify order of fish) were easily parsed and formatted. It typically takes several days to produce similar results when relying upon manual editing. This tool could open the .gb file of Genbank directly and help us to use existing mitogenomic data. In the present study, we established the first clear and robust molecular phylogeny of 103 tetraodontiform fishes, a goal that has long eluded ichthyologists. MITOSCISSOR greatly increases the efficiency with which DNA data files can be parsed and annotated, and thus has the potential to greatly facilitate evolutionary analysis using mitogenomic data.

26115255,Estimation of the environmental dam-offspring correlation in beef cattle.,"A long standing controversy in animal breeding is related to the strong negative estimates of the direct-maternal genetic correlation obtained when fitting data on maternally influenced traits. In this article, we focused on a model that introduces a new correlation parameter among dam-offspring records. The extant theory allows estimation of the parameter when dams have at most a single offspring. Our goal was to develop an inferential procedure in a more general setting. To do so, we applied a Bayesian approach and we showed that the estimation could be accomplished by introducing a Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) step embedded into a regular Gibbs sampler program. The procedure was implemented by means of an MCMC algorithm known as the Griddy-Gibbs sampler, and a Fortran 90 library was created to accomplish the task. The computer program is available from http://www.agro.uba.ar/catedras/mg_animal/software/RDBLK. With this tool at hand, we applied the inferential procedure to weaning weight records on beef cattle calves from an Argentinean Hereford herd, and we estimated the marginal distribution of the environmental dam-offspring correlation parameter. The distribution was unimodal and symmetric with a mean value of -0.14 (�0.03) and a 95% high posterior density interval between -0.20 and -0.07, indicating that the model placed a huge mass on negative values of the parameter. Noticeably, the magnitude of the direct-maternal genetic correlation diminished from -0.61 to -0.37 with respect to the standard maternal animal model. This result reinforces the idea that environmental covariances among dam-offspring records may bias the estimate of the direct-maternal genetic correlation.","kes, hji",0.0,0,0,2,0.0,,

26150785,The PREP pipeline: standardized preprocessing for large-scale EEG analysis.,"The technology to collect brain imaging and physiological measures has become portable and ubiquitous, opening the possibility of large-scale analysis of real-world human imaging. By its nature, such data is large and complex, making automated processing essential. This paper shows how lack of attention to the very early stages of an EEG preprocessing pipeline can reduce the signal-to-noise ratio and introduce unwanted artifacts into the data, particularly for computations done in single precision. We demonstrate that ordinary average referencing improves the signal-to-noise ratio, but that noisy channels can contaminate the results. We also show that identification of noisy channels depends on the reference and examine the complex interaction of filtering, noisy channel identification, and referencing. We introduce a multi-stage robust referencing scheme to deal with the noisy channel-reference interaction. We propose a standardized early-stage EEG processing pipeline (PREP) and discuss the application of the pipeline to more than 600 EEG datasets. The pipeline includes an automatically generated report for each dataset processed. Users can download the PREP pipeline as a freely available MATLAB library from http://eegstudy.org/prepcode.","kes, hji",0.0,0,0,2,0.0,,

As data collection is increasingly streamlined and ubiquitous, data exploration, discovery and analytics get considerably harder. Exploratory querying of heterogeneous and multi-source information is both difficult and necessary to advance our knowledge about the world around us.<h4>Research design</h4>We developed a mechanism to integrate dispersed multi-source data and service the mashed information via human and machine interfaces in a secure, scalable manner. This process facilitates the exploration of subtle associations between variables, population strata, or clusters of data elements, which may be opaque to standard independent inspection of the individual sources. This a new platform includes a device agnostic tool (Dashboard webapp, http://socr.umich.edu/HTML5/Dashboard/) for graphical querying, navigating and exploring the multivariate associations in complex heterogeneous datasets.<h4>Results</h4>The paper illustrates this core functionality and serviceoriented infrastructure using healthcare data (e.g., US data from the 2010 Census, Demographic and Economic surveys, Bureau of Labor Statistics, and Center for Medicare Services) as well as Parkinson's Disease neuroimaging data. Both the back-end data archive and the front-end dashboard interfaces are continuously expanded to include additional data elements and new ways to customize the human and machine interactions.<h4>Conclusions</h4>A client-side data import utility allows for easy and intuitive integration of user-supplied datasets. This completely open-science framework may be used for exploratory analytics, confirmatory analyses, meta-analyses, and education and training purposes in a wide variety of fields.","kes, hji",0.0,0,0,2,0.0,,out of scope
26271256,DeDaL: Cytoscape 3 app for producing and morphing data-driven and structure-driven network layouts.,"<h4>Background</h4>Visualization and analysis of molecular profiling data together with biological networks are able to provide new mechanistic insights into biological functions. Currently, it is possible to visualize high-throughput data on top of pre-defined network layouts, but they are not always adapted to a given data analysis task. A network layout based simultaneously on the network structure and the associated multidimensional data might be advantageous for data visualization and analysis in some cases.<h4>Results</h4>We developed a Cytoscape app, which allows constructing biological network layouts based on the data from molecular profiles imported as values of node attributes. DeDaL is a Cytoscape 3 app, which uses linear and non-linear algorithms of dimension reduction to produce data-driven network layouts based on multidimensional data (typically gene expression). DeDaL implements several data pre-processing and layout post-processing steps such as continuous morphing between two arbitrary network layouts and aligning one network layout with respect to another one by rotating and mirroring. The combination of all these functionalities facilitates the creation of insightful network layouts representing both structural network features and correlation patterns in multivariate data. We demonstrate the added value of applying DeDaL in several practical applications, including an example of a large protein-protein interaction network.<h4>Conclusions</h4>DeDaL is a convenient tool for applying data dimensionality reduction methods and for designing insightful data displays based on data-driven layouts of biological networks, built within Cytoscape environment.

Marker genes are of great importance for determining cell identity, and for understanding tissue specific gene function and the molecular mechanisms underlying complex diseases.<h4>Results</h4>We have developed a new bioinformatics tool called MGFM (Marker Gene Finder in Microarray data) to predict marker genes from microarray gene expression data. Marker genes are identified through the grouping of samples of the same type with similar marker gene expression levels. We verified our approach using two microarray data sets from the NCBI's Gene Expression Omnibus public repository encompassing samples for similar sets of five human tissues (brain, heart, kidney, liver, and lung). Comparison with another tool for tissue-specific gene identification and validation with literature-derived established tissue markers established functionality, accuracy and simplicity of our tool. Furthermore, top ranked marker genes were experimentally validated by reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR). The sets of predicted marker genes associated with the five selected tissues comprised well-known genes of particular importance in these tissues. The tool is freely available from the Bioconductor web site, and it is also provided as an online application integrated into the CellFinder platform ( http://cellfinder.org/analysis/marker ).<h4>Conclusions</h4>MGFM is a useful tool to predict tissue/cell type marker genes using microarray gene expression data. The implementation of the tool as an R-package as well as an application within CellFinder facilitates its use.","kes, hji",0.0,0,0,2,0.0,,
26318525,[MEG]PLS: A pipeline for MEG data analysis and partial least squares statistics.,"The emphasis of modern neurobiological theories has recently shifted from the independent function of brain areas to their interactions in the context of whole-brain networks. As a result, neuroimaging methods and analyses have also increasingly focused on network discovery. Magnetoencephalography (MEG) is a neuroimaging modality that captures neural activity with a high degree of temporal specificity, providing detailed, time varying maps of neural activity. Partial least squares (PLS) analysis is a multivariate framework that can be used to isolate distributed spatiotemporal patterns of neural activity that differentiate groups or cognitive tasks, to relate neural activity to behavior, and to capture large-scale network interactions. Here we introduce [MEG]PLS, a MATLAB-based platform that streamlines MEG data preprocessing, source reconstruction and PLS analysis in a single unified framework. [MEG]PLS facilitates MRI preprocessing, including segmentation and coregistration, MEG preprocessing, including filtering, epoching, and artifact correction, MEG sensor analysis, in both time and frequency domains, MEG source analysis, including multiple head models and beamforming algorithms, and combines these with a suite of PLS analyses. The pipeline is open-source and modular, utilizing functions from FieldTrip (Donders, NL), AFNI (NIMH, USA), SPM8 (UCL, UK) and PLScmd (Baycrest, CAN), which are extensively supported and continually developed by their respective communities. [MEG]PLS is flexible, providing both a graphical user interface and command-line options, depending on the needs of the user. A visualization suite allows multiple types of data and analyses to be displayed and includes 4-D montage functionality.

The aim of this study was to validate the predictive value of a web-based recurrence risk estimator (RRE; http://www.nmr.mgh.harvard.edu/RRE/) of TSI.<h4>Methods</h4>Data from the prospective hospital-based TIA database of the First Affiliated Hospital of Zhengzhou University were analyzed. The RRE and ABCD2 scores were calculated within 7 days of symptom onset. The predictive outcome was ischemic stroke occurrence at 90 days. The receiver-operating characteristics curves were plotted, and the predictive value of the two models was assessed by computing the C statistics.<h4>Results</h4>A total of 221 eligible patients were prospectively enrolled, of whom 46 (20.81%) experienced a stroke within 90 days. The 90-day stroke risk in high-risk TSI patients (RRE =4) was 3.406-fold greater than in those at low risk (P <0.001). The C statistic of RRE (0.681; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.592-0.771) was statistically higher than that of ABCD2 score (0.546; 95% CI, 0.454-0.638; Z = 2.115; P = 0.0344) at 90 days.<h4>Conclusion</h4>The RRE score had a higher predictive value than the ABCD2 score for assessing the 90-day risk of stroke after TSI.","kes, hji",0.0,0,0,2,0.0,,
26395772,APTANI: a computational tool to select aptamers through sequence-structure motif analysis of HT-SELEX data.,"<h4>Motivation</h4>Aptamers are synthetic nucleic acid molecules that can bind biological targets in virtue of both their sequence and three-dimensional structure. Aptamers are selected using SELEX, Systematic Evolution of Ligands by EXponential enrichment, a technique that exploits aptamer-target binding affinity. The SELEX procedure, coupled with high-throughput sequencing (HT-SELEX), creates billions of random sequences capable of binding different epitopes on specific targets. Since this technique produces enormous amounts of data, computational analysis represents a critical step to screen and select the most biologically relevant sequences.<h4>Results</h4>Here, we present APTANI, a computational tool to identify target-specific aptamers from HT-SELEX data and secondary structure information. APTANI builds on AptaMotif algorithm, originally implemented to analyze SELEX data; extends the applicability of AptaMotif to HT-SELEX data and introduces new functionalities, as the possibility to identify binding motifs, to cluster aptamer families or to compare output results from different HT-SELEX cycles. Tabular and graphical representations facilitate the downstream biological interpretation of results.<h4>Availability and implementation</h4>APTANI is available at http://aptani.unimore.it.<h4>Contact</h4>silvio.bicciato@unimore.it<h4>Supplementary information</h4>Supplementary data are available at Bioinformatics online.","kes, hji",0.0,0,0,2,0.0,,
26398339,Small Supernumerary Marker Chromosomes in Human Infertility.,"Small supernumerary marker chromosomes (sSMC) are structurally abnormal chromosomes that cannot be unambiguously identified by banding cytogenetics. The objective of this study was to provide an overview of sSMC frequency and characterization in a context of infertility and to review the literature describing sSMC in relation with male and female infertility. Therefore, a systematic literature review on sSMC associated with infertility was conducted by means of a PubMed literature and a sSMC database (http://ssmc-tl.com/sSMC.html) search. A total of 234 patients with infertility were identified as carriers of sSMC. All chromosomes, except chromosomes 10, 19 and the X, were involved in sSMC, and in 72% the sSMC originated from acrocentric chromosomes. Euchromatic imbalances were caused by the presence of sSMC in 30% of the cases. Putative genes have been identified in only 1.2% of sSMC associated with infertility. The implication of sSMC in infertility could be due to a partial trisomy of some genes but also to mechanical effects perturbing meiosis. Further precise molecular and interphase-architecture studies on sSMC are needed in the future to characterize the relationship between this chromosomal anomaly and human infertility.","kes, hji",0.0,0,0,2,0.0,,

Theme 1 focused on improving our understanding of individuals� and organisational risk factors and on improving the quality of risk assessments (work packages 1�3) and theme 2 focused on developing patient-reported outcome measures (work packages 4 and 5).<h4>Methods</h4>The programme comprised 21 individual pieces of work. Pain: (1) multicentre pain prevalence study in acute hospitals, (2) multicentre pain prevalence study in community localities incorporating (3) a comparison of case-finding methods, and (4) multicentre, prospective cohort study. Severe pressure ulcers: (5) retrospective case study, (6) patient involvement workshop with the Pressure Ulcer Research Service User Network for the UK (PURSUN UK) and (7) development of root cause analysis methodology. Risk assessment: (8) systematic review, (9) consensus study, (10) conceptual framework development and theoretical causal pathway, (11) design and pretesting of draft Risk Assessment Framework and (12) field test to assess reliability, validity, data completeness and clinical usability. Quality of life: (13) conceptual framework development (systematic review, patient interviews), (14 and 15) provisional instrument development, with items generated from patient interviews [from (1) above] two systematic reviews and experts, (16) pretesting of the provisional Pressure Ulcer Quality of Life (PU-QOL) instrument using mixed methods, (17) field test 1 including (18) optimal mode of administration substudy and item reduction with testing of scale formation, acceptability, scaling assumptions, reliability and validity, and (19) field test 2 � final psychometric evaluation to test scale targeting, item response categories, item fit, response bias, acceptability, scaling assumptions, reliability and validity. Cost�utility: (20) time trade-off task valuations of health states derived from selected PU-QOL items, and (21) validation of the items selected and psychometric properties of the new Pressure Ulcer Quality of Life Utility Index (PUQOL-UI).<h4>Key findings</h4>Pain: prevalence studies � hospital and community patients experience both pressure area-related and pressure ulcer pain; pain cohort study � indicates that pain is independently predictive of category 2 (and above) pressure ulcer development. Severe pressure ulcers: these were more likely to develop in contexts in which clinicians failed to listen to patients/carers or recognise/respond to high risk or the presence of an existing pressure ulcer and services were not effectively co-ordinated; service users found the interactive workshop format valuable; including novel components (interviews with patients and carers) in root cause analysis improves the quality of the insights captured. Risk assessment: we developed a Pressure Ulcer Risk Assessment Framework, the PURPOSE-T, incorporating the Minimum Data Set, a screening stage, a full assessment stage, use of colour to support decision-making, and decision pathways that make a clear distinction between patients with an existing pressure ulcer(s) (or scarring from previous ulcers) who require secondary prevention and treatment and those at risk who require primary prevention (http://medhealth.leeds.ac.uk/accesspurposet). Quality of life: the final PU-QOL instrument consists of 10 scales to measure pain, exudate, odour, sleep, vitality, mobility/movement, daily activities, emotional well-being, self-consciousness and appearance, and participation (http://medhealth.leeds.ac.uk/puqol-ques). Cost�utility: seven items were selected from the PU-QOL instrument for inclusion in the PUQOL-UI (http://medhealth.leeds.ac.uk/puqol-ui); secondary study analysis indicated that item selection for the PUQOL-UI was appropriate and that the index was acceptable to patients and had adequate levels of validity.<h4>Conclusions</h4>The PURPOSE programme has provided important insights for pressure ulcer prevention and treatment and involvement of service users in research and development, with implications for patient and public involvement, clinical practice, quality/safety/health service management and research including replication of the pain risk factor study, work exploring �best practice� settings, the impact of including skin status as an indicator for escalation of preventative interventions, further psychometric evaluation of PU-QOL and PUQOL-UI the measurement of �disease attribution.�<h4>Funding</h4>The National Institute for Health Research Programme Grants for Applied Research programme.","kes, hji",0.0,0,0,2,0.0,,

26477251,Spin labeling and Double Electron-Electron Resonance (DEER) to Deconstruct Conformational Ensembles of HIV Protease.,"An understanding of macromolecular conformational equilibrium in biological systems is oftentimes essential to understand function, dysfunction, and disease. For the past few years, our lab has been utilizing site-directed spin labeling (SDSL), coupled with electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) spectroscopy, to characterize the conformational ensemble and ligand-induced conformational shifts of HIV-1 protease (HIV-1PR). The biomedical importance of characterizing the fractional occupancy of states within the conformational ensemble critically impacts our hypothesis of a conformational selection mechanism of drug-resistance evolution in HIV-1PR. The purpose of the following chapter is to give a timeline perspective of our SDSL EPR approach to characterizing conformational sampling of HIV-1PR. We provide detailed instructions for the procedure utilized in analyzing distance profiles for HIV-1PR obtained from pulsed electron-electron double resonance (PELDOR). Specifically, we employ a version of PELDOR known as double electron-electron resonance (DEER). Data are processed with the software package """"DeerAnalysis"""" (http://www.epr.ethz.ch/software), which implements Tikhonov regularization (TKR), to generate a distance profile from electron spin-echo amplitude modulations. We assign meaning to resultant distance profiles based upon a conformational sampling model, which is described herein. The TKR distance profiles are reconstructed with a linear combination of Gaussian functions, which is then statistically analyzed. In general, DEER has proven powerful for observing structural ensembles in proteins and, more recently, nucleic acids.

While their role in cardiac disease is only starting to be understood, their involvement in cardiac hypertrophy is poorly known. We studied the association between lncRNAs and left ventricular hypertrophy using whole transcriptome microarrays. Wild-type mice and mice overexpressing the adenosine A2A receptor were subjected to transverse aortic constriction (TAC) to induce left ventricular hypertrophy. Expression profiles of lncRNAs in the heart were characterized using genome-wide microarrays. An analytical pipeline was specifically developed to extract lncRNA data from microarrays. We identified 2 lncRNAs up-regulated and 3 lncRNAs down-regulated in the hearts of A2A-receptor overexpressing-mice subjected to TAC compared to wild-type mice. Differential expression of these 2 lncRNAs was validated by quantitative PCR.

26537179,BRANE Cut: biologically-related a priori network enhancement with graph cuts for gene regulatory network inference.,"<h4>Background</h4>Inferring gene networks from high-throughput data constitutes an important step in the discovery of relevant regulatory relationships in organism cells. Despite the large number of available Gene Regulatory Network inference methods, the problem remains challenging: the underdetermination in the space of possible solutions requires additional constraints that incorporate a priori information on gene interactions.<h4>Methods</h4>Weighting all possible pairwise gene relationships by a probability of edge presence, we formulate the regulatory network inference as a discrete variational problem on graphs. We enforce biologically plausible coupling between groups and types of genes by minimizing an edge labeling functional coding for a priori structures. The optimization is carried out with Graph cuts, an approach popular in image processing and computer vision. We compare the inferred regulatory networks to results achieved by the mutual-information-based Context Likelihood of Relatedness (CLR) method and by the state-of-the-art GENIE3, winner of the DREAM4 multifactorial challenge.<h4>Results</h4>Our BRANE Cut approach infers more accurately the five DREAM4 in silico networks (with improvements from 6% to 11%). On a real Escherichia coli compendium, an improvement of 11.8% compared to CLR and 3% compared to GENIE3 is obtained in terms of Area Under Precision-Recall curve. Up to 48 additional verified interactions are obtained over GENIE3 for a given precision. On this dataset involving 4345 genes, our method achieves a performance similar to that of GENIE3, while being more than seven times faster. The BRANE Cut code is available at: http://www-syscom.univ-mlv.fr/~pirayre/Codes-GRN-BRANE-cut.html.<h4>Conclusions</h4>BRANE Cut is a weighted graph thresholding method.

It provides quantitative means to explore the transcriptome of an organism of interest. However, interpreting this extremely large data into biological knowledge is a problem, and biologist-friendly tools are lacking. In our lab, we developed Transcriptator, a web application based on a computational Python pipeline with a user-friendly Java interface. This pipeline uses the web services available for BLAST (Basis Local Search Alignment Tool), QuickGO and DAVID (Database for Annotation, Visualization and Integrated Discovery) tools. It offers a report on statistical analysis of functional and Gene Ontology (GO) annotation's enrichment. It helps users to identify enriched biological themes, particularly GO terms, pathways, domains, gene/proteins features and protein-protein interactions related informations. It clusters the transcripts based on functional annotations and generates a tabular report for functional and gene ontology annotations for each submitted transcript to the web server. The implementation of QuickGo web-services in our pipeline enable the users to carry out GO-Slim analysis, whereas the integration of PORTRAIT (Prediction of transcriptomic non coding RNA (ncRNA) by ab initio methods) helps to identify the non coding RNAs and their regulatory role in transcriptome. In summary, Transcriptator is a useful software for both NGS and array data. It helps the users to characterize the de-novo assembled reads, obtained from NGS experiments for non-referenced organisms, while it also performs the functional enrichment analysis of differentially expressed transcripts/genes for both RNA-seq and micro-array experiments. It generates easy to read tables and interactive charts for better understanding of the data. The pipeline is modular in nature, and provides an opportunity to add new plugins in the future.

26628858,Characterizing Cancer-Specific Networks by Integrating TCGA Data.,"The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) generates comprehensive genomic data for thousands of patients over more than 20 cancer types. TCGA data are typically whole-genome measurements of multiple genomic features, such as DNA copy numbers, DNA methylation, and gene expression, providing unique opportunities for investigating cancer mechanism from multiple molecular and regulatory layers. We propose a Bayesian graphical model to systemically integrate multi-platform TCGA data for inference of the interactions between different genomic features either within a gene or between multiple genes. The presence or absence of edges in the graph indicates the presence or absence of conditional dependence between genomic features. The inference is restricted to genes within a known biological network, but can be extended to any sets of genes.

26631838,"Relative Prognostic and Predictive Value of Gene Signature and Histologic Grade in Estrogen Receptor-Positive, HER2-Negative Breast Cancer.","<h4>Background</h4>In estrogen receptor (ER)-positive, human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2)-negative breast cancer, first-generation genomic signatures serve predominately as prognostic biomarkers and secondarily as predictors of response to chemotherapy. We compared both the prognostic and predictive value of histologic grades and genomic markers.<h4>Methods</h4>We retrieved publicly available cDNA microarray data from 1373 primary ER(+)/HER2(-) breast cancers and developed a genomic signature simulated from Recurrence Online (http://www.recurrenceonline.com/) to calculate the recurrence score and risk using predefined sets of genes in the cDNA microarray. We then compared the prognostic and predictive information provided by histologic grade and genomic signature.<h4>Results</h4>Based on genomic signatures, 55%, 28%, and 17% of breast cancers were classified as low, intermediate, and high risk, respectively, whereas the histologic grades were I, II, and III in 22%, 59%, and 19% of breast cancers, respectively. Univariate analysis in the untreated cohort revealed that both histologic grade (overall P = .007) and genomic signature (P < .001) could predict prognosis. Results were similar using the genomic signature, with pathologic complete response rates of 4.6%, 5.7%, and 16.5% for low-, intermediate-, and high-risk cancers, respectively. Neither biomarker was statistically significant in multivariate analysis for predictive response to neoadjuvant chemotherapy (NAC).<h4>Conclusion</h4>Genomic signature was better at identifying low-risk cases compared to histologic grade alone, but both markers had similar predictive values for NAC response. Better predictive biomarkers for NAC response are still needed.","kes, hji",0.0,0,0,2,0.0,,references other data resource
26672762,CyREST: Turbocharging Cytoscape Access for External Tools via a RESTful API.,"As bioinformatic workflows become increasingly complex and involve multiple specialized tools, so does the difficulty of reliably reproducing those workflows. Cytoscape is a critical workflow component for executing network visualization, analysis, and publishing tasks, but it can be operated only manually via a point-and-click user interface. Consequently, Cytoscape-oriented tasks are laborious and often error prone, especially with multistep protocols involving many networks. In this paper, we present the new cyREST Cytoscape app and accompanying harmonization libraries. Together, they improve workflow reproducibility and researcher productivity by enabling popular languages (e.g., Python and R, JavaScript, and C#) and tools (e.g., IPython/Jupyter Notebook and RStudio) to directly define and query networks, and perform network analysis, layouts and renderings. We describe cyREST's API and overall construction, and present Python- and R-based examples that illustrate how Cytoscape can be integrated into large scale data analysis pipelines. cyREST is available in the Cytoscape app store (http://apps.cytoscape.org) where it has been downloaded over 1900 times since its release in late 2014.","kes, hji",0.0,0,0,2,0.0,,

However, the absence of atomistic detail impedes the analysis of specific atomic interactions that are determinant in most interesting biomolecular processes. In order to study these phenomena, it is necessary to reconstruct the atomistic structure from the CG representation. This structure can be analyzed by itself or be used as an onset for atomistic molecular dynamics simulations. In this work, we present a computer program that accurately reconstructs the atomistic structure from a CG model for proteins, using a simple geometrical algorithm.<h4>Availability and implementation</h4>The software is free and available online at http://www.ic.fcen.uba.ar/cg2aa/cg2aa.py<h4>Supplementary information</h4>Supplementary data are available at Bioinformatics online.<h4>Contact</h4>lula@qi.fcen.uba.ar.","kes, hji",0.0,0,0,2,0.0,,
26678663,EC: an efficient error correction algorithm for short reads.,"<h4>Background</h4>In highly parallel next-generation sequencing (NGS) techniques millions to billions of short reads are produced from a genomic sequence in a single run. Due to the limitation of the NGS technologies, there could be errors in the reads. The error rate of the reads can be reduced with trimming and by correcting the erroneous bases of the reads. It helps to achieve high quality data and the computational complexity of many biological applications will be greatly reduced if the reads are first corrected. We have developed a novel error correction algorithm called EC and compared it with four other state-of-the-art algorithms using both real and simulated sequencing reads.<h4>Results</h4>We have done extensive and rigorous experiments that reveal that EC is indeed an effective, scalable, and efficient error correction tool. Real reads that we have employed in our performance evaluation are Illumina-generated short reads of various lengths. Six experimental datasets we have utilized are taken from sequence and read archive (SRA) at NCBI. The simulated reads are obtained by picking substrings from random positions of reference genomes. To introduce errors, some of the bases of the simulated reads are changed to other bases with some probabilities.<h4>Conclusions</h4>Error correction is a vital problem in biology especially for NGS data. In this paper we present a novel algorithm, called Error Corrector (EC), for correcting substitution errors in biological sequencing reads. We plan to investigate the possibility of employing the techniques introduced in this research paper to handle insertion and deletion errors also.<h4>Software availability</h4>The implementation is freely available for non-commercial purposes.

This study describes a method PEPstrMOD, which is an updated version of PEPstr, developed specifically for predicting the structure of peptides containing natural and non-natural/modified residues.<h4>Results</h4>PEPstrMOD integrates Forcefield_NCAA and Forcefield_PTM force field libraries to handle 147 non-natural residues and 32 types of post-translational modifications respectively by performing molecular dynamics using AMBER. AMBER was also used to handle other modifications like peptide cyclization, use of D-amino acids and capping of terminal residues. In addition, GROMACS was used to implement 210 non-natural side-chains in peptides using SwissSideChain force field library. We evaluated the performance of PEPstrMOD on three datasets generated from Protein Data Bank; i) ModPep dataset contains 501 non-natural peptides, ii) ModPep16, a subset of ModPep, and iii) CyclicPep contains 34 cyclic peptides. We achieved backbone Root Mean Square Deviation between the actual and predicted structure of peptides in the range of 3.81-4.05 �.<h4>Conclusions</h4>In summary, the method PEPstrMOD has been developed that predicts the structure of modified peptide from the sequence/structure given as input. We validated the PEPstrMOD application using a dataset of peptides having non-natural/modified residues. PEPstrMOD offers unique advantages that allow the users to predict the structures of peptides having i) natural residues, ii) non-naturally modified residues, iii) terminal modifications, iv) post-translational modifications, v) D-amino acids, and also allows extended simulation of predicted peptides. This will help the researchers to have prior structural information of modified peptides to further design the peptides for desired therapeutic property.

Next-generation sequencing technology performs advantageously and effectively in genetic mapping and genome analysis of diverse genetic resources. Hence, we combined re-sequencing technology and a bin map strategy to construct an ultra-high-density bin map with thousands of bin markers to precisely map a quantitative trait locus.<h4>Results</h4>In this study, we generated a linkage map containing 1,151,856 high quality SNPs between Mo17 and B73, which were verified in the maize intermated B73 � Mo17 (IBM) Syn10 population. This resource is an excellent complement to existing maize genetic maps available in an online database� (iPlant, http://data.maizecode.org/maize/qtl/syn10/ ). Moreover, in this population combined with the IBM Syn4 RIL population, we detected 135 QTLs for flowering time and plant height traits across the two populations. Eighteen known functional genes and twenty-five candidate genes for flowering time and plant height trait were fine-mapped into a 2.21-4.96�Mb interval. Map expansion and segregation distortion were also analyzed, and evidence for inadvertent selection of early flowering time in the process of mapping population development was observed. Furthermore, an updated integrated map with 1,151,856 high-quality SNPs, 2,916 traditional markers and 6,618 bin markers was constructed. The data were deposited into the iPlant Discovery Environment (DE), which provides a fundamental resource of genetic data for the maize genetic research community.<h4>Conclusions</h4>Our findings provide basic essential genetic data for the maize genetic research community. An updated IBM Syn10 population and a reliable, verified high-quality SNP set between Mo17 and B73 will aid in future molecular breeding efforts.","kes, hji",0.0,0,0,2,0.0,,

The lack of standardized and automated methodologies poses a challenge for the analysis and interpretation of RNA sequencing data. We critically compare and evaluate state-of-the-art bioinformatics approaches and present a workflow that integrates the best performing data analysis, data evaluation and annotation methods in a Transparent, Reproducible and Automated PipeLINE (TRAPLINE) for RNA sequencing data processing (suitable for Illumina, SOLiD and Solexa).<h4>Results</h4>Comparative transcriptomics analyses with TRAPLINE result in a set of differentially expressed genes, their corresponding protein-protein interactions, splice variants, promoter activity, predicted miRNA-target interactions and files for single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) calling. The obtained results are combined into a single file for downstream analysis such as network construction. We demonstrate the value of the proposed pipeline by characterizing the transcriptome of our recently described stem cell derived antibiotic selected cardiac bodies ('aCaBs').<h4>Conclusion</h4>TRAPLINE supports NGS-based research by providing a workflow that requires no bioinformatics skills, decreases the processing time of the analysis and works in the cloud.

In this regard, we investigated the influence of benchmark datasets on the predictive performance of computational predictors in the field of miRNA identification, and found that the negative samples have significant impact on the predictive results of various methods. We constructed a new benchmark set with different data distributions of negative samples. Trained with this high quality benchmark dataset, a new computational predictor called iMiRNA-SSF was proposed, which employed various features extracted from RNA sequences.

We aimed to compare the effects of nCT with those of nCRT.<h4>Patients and methods</h4>This multicentre trial, which was conducted in Sweden and Norway, recruited 181 patients with carcinoma of the oesophagus or the gastro-oesophageal junction who were candidates for curative-intended treatment. The primary end point was histological complete response after neoadjuvant treatment, which has been shown to be correlated with increased long-term survival. Study participants were randomized to nCT or nCRT, followed by surgery with two-field lymphadenectomy. Three cycles of platin/5-fluorouracil were administered in both arms, whereas 40 Gy of concomitant radiotherapy was added in the nCRT arm.<h4>Results</h4>The trial met the primary end point, histological complete response being achieved in 28% after nCRT versus 9% after nCT (P = 0.002). Lymph-node metastases were observed in 62% in the nCT group versus 35% in the nCRT group (P = 0.001). The R0 resection rate was 87% after nCRT and 74% after nCT (P = 0.04). There was no difference in overall survival between the treatment arms.<h4>Conclusion</h4>The addition of radiotherapy to neoadjuvant chemotherapy results in higher histological complete response rate, higher R0 resection rate, and a lower frequency of lymph-node metastases, without significantly affecting survival.<h4>Clinicaltrialsgov</h4>NCT01362127 (https://clinicaltrials.gov; The full study protocol was registered in the Clinical Trials Database).","kes, hji",0.0,0,0,2,0.0,,

26833341,Integrative analysis for identifying joint modular patterns of gene-expression and drug-response data.,"<h4>Motivation</h4>The underlying relationship between genomic factors and the response of diverse cancer drugs still remains unclear. A number of studies showed that the heterogeneous responses to anticancer treatments of patients were partly associated with their specific changes in gene expression and somatic alterations. The emerging large-scale pharmacogenomic data provide us valuable opportunities to improve existing therapies or to guide early-phase clinical trials of compounds under development. However, how to identify the underlying combinatorial patterns among pharmacogenomics data are still a challenging issue.<h4>Results</h4>In this study, we adopted a sparse network-regularized partial least square (SNPLS) method to identify joint modular patterns using large-scale pairwise gene-expression and drug-response data. We incorporated a molecular network to the (sparse) partial least square model to improve the module accuracy via a network-based penalty. We first demonstrated the effectiveness of SNPLS using a set of simulation data and compared it with two typical methods. Further, we applied it to gene expression profiles for 13 321 genes and pharmacological profiles for 98 anticancer drugs across 641 cancer cell lines consisting of diverse types of human cancers. We identified 20 gene-drug co-modules, each of which consists of 30 cell lines, 137 genes and 2 drugs on average. The majority of identified co-modules have significantly functional implications and coordinated gene-drug associations. The modular analysis here provided us new insights into the molecular mechanisms of how drugs act and suggested new drug targets for therapy of certain types of cancers.<h4>Availability and implementation</h4>A matlab package of SNPLS is available at http://page.amss.ac.cn/shihua.zhang/<h4>Contact</h4>: zsh@amss.ac.cn<h4>Supplementary information</h4>Supplementary data are available at Bioinformatics online.","kes, hji",0.0,0,0,2,0.0,,
26893301,Clustering Genes of Common Evolutionary History.,"Phylogenetic inference can potentially result in a more accurate tree using data from multiple loci. However, if the loci are incongruent-due to events such as incomplete lineage sorting or horizontal gene transfer-it can be misleading to infer a single tree. To address this, many previous contributions have taken a mechanistic approach, by modeling specific processes. Alternatively, one can cluster loci without assuming how these incongruencies might arise. Such """"process-agnostic"""" approaches typically infer a tree for each locus and cluster these. There are, however, many possible combinations of tree distance and clustering methods; their comparative performance in the context of tree incongruence is largely unknown. Furthermore, because standard model selection criteria such as AIC cannot be applied to problems with a variable number of topologies, the issue of inferring the optimal number of clusters is poorly understood. Here, we perform a large-scale simulation study of phylogenetic distances and clustering methods to infer loci of common evolutionary history. We observe that the best-performing combinations are distances accounting for branch lengths followed by spectral clustering or Ward's method. We also introduce two statistical tests to infer the optimal number of clusters and show that they strongly outperform the silhouette criterion, a general-purpose heuristic. We illustrate the usefulness of the approach by 1) identifying errors in a previous phylogenetic analysis of yeast species and 2) identifying topological incongruence among newly sequenced loci of the globeflower fly genus Chiastocheta We release treeCl, a new program to cluster genes of common evolutionary history (http://git.io/treeCl).","kes, hji",0.0,0,0,2,0.0,,

Modern high-throughput technologies generate a broad array of different data types, providing distinct--but often complementary--information. However, the large amount of data adds burden to any inference task. Flexible Bayesian methods may reduce the necessity for strong modelling assumptions, but can also increase the computational burden. We present an improved implementation of a Bayesian correlated clustering algorithm, that permits integrated clustering to be routinely performed across multiple datasets, each with tens of thousands of items. By exploiting GPU based computation, we are able to improve runtime performance of the algorithm by almost four orders of magnitude. This permits analysis across genomic-scale data sets, greatly expanding the range of applications over those originally possible.

However, the information associated with genes and genetic markers for pumpkin is very limited. In order to identify new genes and to develop genetic markers, we performed a transcriptome analysis (RNA-Seq) of two contrasting pumpkin cultivars. Leaves and female flowers of cultivars, 'Big Moose' with large round fruits and 'Munchkin' with small round fruits, were harvested for total RNA extraction. We obtained a total of 6�GB (Big Moose; http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/Traces/sra/?run=SRR3056882) and 5�GB (Munchkin; http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/Traces/sra/?run=SRR3056883) sequence data (NCBI SRA database SRX1502732 and SRX1502735, respectively), which correspond to 18,055,786 and 14,824,292 150-base reads.

27030549,The advantage of laser-capture microdissection over whole tissue analysis in proteomic profiling studies.,"Laser-capture microdissection (LCM) offers a reliable cell population enrichment tool and has been successfully coupled to MS analysis. Despite this, most proteomic studies employ whole tissue lysate (WTL) analysis in the discovery of disease biomarkers and in profiling analyses. Furthermore, the influence of tissue heterogeneity in WTL analysis, nor its impact in biomarker discovery studies have been completely elucidated. In order to address this, we compared previously obtained high resolution MS data from a cohort of 38 breast cancer tissues, of which both LCM enriched tumor epithelial cells and WTL samples were analyzed. Label-free quantification (LFQ) analysis through MaxQuant software showed a significantly higher number of identified and quantified proteins in LCM enriched samples (3404) compared to WTLs (2837). Furthermore, WTL samples displayed a higher amount of missing data compared to LCM both at peptide and protein levels (p-value < 0.001). 2D analysis on co-expressed proteins revealed discrepant expression of immune system and lipid metabolisms related proteins between LCM and WTL samples. We hereby show that LCM better dissected the biology of breast tumor epithelial cells, possibly due to lower interference from surrounding tissues and highly abundant proteins.

27076459,Inferring microRNA-disease associations by random walk on a heterogeneous network with multiple data sources.,"Since the discovery of the regulatory function of microRNA (miRNA), increased attention has focused on identifying the relationship between miRNA and disease. It has been suggested that computational method are an efficient way to identify potential disease-related miRNAs for further confirmation using biological experiments. In this paper, we first highlighted three limitations commonly associated with previous computational methods. To resolve these limitations, we established disease similarity subnetwork and miRNA similarity subnetwork by integrating multiple data sources, where the disease similarity is composed of disease semantic similarity and disease functional similarity, and the miRNA similarity is calculated using the miRNA-target gene and miRNA-lncRNA (long non-coding RNA) associations. Then, a heterogeneous network was constructed by connecting the disease similarity subnetwork and the miRNA similarity subnetwork using the known miRNA-disease associations. We extended random walk with restart to predict miRNA-disease associations in the heterogeneous network. The leave-one-out cross-validation achieved an average area under the curve (AUC) of 0:8049 across 341 diseases and 476 miRNAs. For five-fold cross-validation, our method achieved an AUC from 0:7970 to 0:9249 for 15 human diseases.

27102804,Using expected sequence features to improve basecalling accuracy of amplicon pyrosequencing data.,"<h4>Background</h4>Amplicon pyrosequencing targets a known genetic region and thus inherently produces reads highly anticipated to have certain features, such as conserved nucleotide sequence, and in the case of protein coding DNA, an open reading frame. Pyrosequencing errors, consisting mainly of nucleotide insertions and deletions, are on the other hand likely to disrupt open reading frames. Such an inverse relationship between errors and expectation based on prior knowledge can be used advantageously to guide the process known as basecalling, i.e. the inference of nucleotide sequence from raw sequencing data.<h4>Results</h4>The new basecalling method described here, named Multipass, implements a probabilistic framework for working with the raw flowgrams obtained by pyrosequencing. For each sequence variant Multipass calculates the likelihood and nucleotide sequence of several most likely sequences given the flowgram data. This probabilistic approach enables integration of basecalling into a larger model where other parameters can be incorporated, such as the likelihood for observing a full-length open reading frame at the targeted region. We apply the method to 454 amplicon pyrosequencing data obtained from a malaria virulence gene family, where Multipass generates 20 % more error-free sequences than current state of the art methods, and provides sequence characteristics that allow generation of a set of high confidence error-free sequences.<h4>Conclusions</h4>This novel method can be used to increase accuracy of existing and future amplicon sequencing data, particularly where extensive prior knowledge is available about the obtained sequences, for example in analysis of the immunoglobulin VDJ region where Multipass can be combined with a model for the known recombining germline genes. Multipass is available for Roche 454 data at http://www.cbs.dtu.dk/services/MultiPass-1.0 , and the concept can potentially be implemented for other sequencing technologies as well.","kes, hji",0.0,0,0,2,0.0,,
27113639,Vapocoolants (cold spray) for pain treatment during intravenous cannulation.,"<h4>Background</h4>Intravenous cannulation is a painful procedure that can provoke anxiety and stress. Injecting local anaesthetic can provide analgesia at the time of cannulation, but it is a painful procedure. Topical anaesthetic creams take between 30 and 90 minutes to produce an effect. A quicker acting analgesic allows more timely investigation and treatment. Vapocoolants have been used in this setting, but studies have reported mixed results.<h4>Objectives</h4>To determine effects of vapocoolants on pain associated with intravenous cannulation in adults and children. To explore variables that might affect the performance of vapocoolants, including time required for application, distance from the skin when applied and time to cannulation. To look at adverse effects associated with the use of vapocoolants.<h4>Search methods</h4>We searched the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), MEDLINE, EMBASE, Latin American Caribbean Health Sciences Literature (LILACS), the Cumulative Index to Nursing and Allied Health Literature (CINAHL), the Institute for Scientific Information (ISI) Web of Science and the http://clinicaltrials.gov/, http://www.controlled-trials.com/ and http://www.trialscentral.org/ databases to 1 May 2015. We applied no language restrictions. We also scanned the reference lists of included papers.<h4>Selection criteria</h4>We included all blinded and unblinded randomized controlled trials (RTCs) comparing any vapocoolant with placebo or control to reduce pain during intravenous cannulation in adults and children.<h4>Data collection and analysis</h4>Three review authors independently assessed trial quality and extracted data, contacted study authors for additional information and assessed included studies for risk of bias. We collected and analysed data for the primary outcome of pain during cannulation, and for the secondary outcomes of pain associated with application of the vapocoolant, first attempt success rate of intravenous cannulation, adverse events and participant satisfaction. We performed subgroup analyses for the primary outcome to examine differences based on age of participant, type of vapocoolant used, application time of vapocoolant and clinical situation (emergency vs elective). We used random-effects model meta-analysis in RevMan 5.3 and assessed heterogeneity between trial results by examining forest plots and calculating the I(2) statistic.<h4>Main results</h4>We found nine suitable studies of 1070 participants and included them in the qualitative analyses. We included eight studies of 848 participants in the meta-analysis for the primary outcome (pain during intravenous cannulation). Use of vapocoolants resulted in a reduction in pain scores as measured by a linear 100 mm visual analogue scale (VAS 100) compared with controls (difference between means -12.5 mm, 95% confidence interval (CI) -18.7 to -6.4 mm; moderate-quality evidence). We could not include in the meta-analysis one study, which showed no effects of the intervention.Use of vapocoolants resulted in increased pain scores at the time of application as measured by a VAS 100 compared with controls (difference between means 6.3 mm, 95% CI 2.2 to 10.3 mm; four studies, 461 participants; high-quality evidence) and led to no difference in first attempt success compared with controls (risk ratio (RR) 1.00, 95% CI 0.94 to 1.06; six studies, 812 participants; moderate-quality evidence). We documented eight minor adverse events reported in 279 vapocoolant participants (risk difference (RD) 0.03, 95% CI 0 to 0.05; five studies, 551 participants; low quality-evidence).The overall risk of bias of individual studies ranged from low to high, with high risk of bias for performance and detection bias in four studies. Sensitivity analysis showed that exclusion of studies at high or unclear risk of bias did not materially alter the results of this review.<h4>Authors' conclusions</h4>Moderate-quality evidence indicates that use of a vapocoolant immediately before intravenous cannulation reduces pain during the procedure.

27152837,Evaluation of OASIS QSAR Models Using ToxCast™ in Vitro Estrogen and Androgen Receptor Binding Data and Application in an Integrated Endocrine Screening Approach.,"<h4>Background</h4>Integrative testing strategies (ITSs) for potential endocrine activity can use tiered in silico and in vitro models. Each component of an ITS should be thoroughly assessed.<h4>Objectives</h4>We used the data from three in vitro ToxCast� binding assays to assess OASIS, a quantitative structure-activity relationship (QSAR) platform covering both estrogen receptor (ER) and androgen receptor (AR) binding. For stronger binders (described here as AC50 < 1 �M), we also examined the relationship of QSAR predictions of ER or AR binding to the results from 18 ER and 10 AR transactivation assays, 72 ER-binding reference compounds, and the in vivo uterotrophic assay.<h4>Methods</h4>NovaScreen binding assay data for ER (human, bovine, and mouse) and AR (human, chimpanzee, and rat) were used to assess the sensitivity, specificity, concordance, and applicability domain of two OASIS QSAR models. The binding strength relative to the QSAR-predicted binding strength was examined for the ER data. The relationship of QSAR predictions of binding to transactivation- and pathway-based assays, as well as to in vivo uterotrophic responses, was examined.<h4>Results</h4>The QSAR models had both high sensitivity (> 75%) and specificity (> 86%) for ER as well as both high sensitivity (92-100%) and specificity (70-81%) for AR. For compounds within the domains of the ER and AR QSAR models that bound with AC50 < 1 �M, the QSAR models accurately predicted the binding for the parent compounds. The parent compounds were active in all transactivation assays where metabolism was incorporated and, except for those compounds known to require metabolism to manifest activity, all assay platforms where metabolism was not incorporated. Compounds in-domain and predicted to bind by the ER QSAR model that were positive in ToxCast� ER binding at AC50 < 1 �M were active in the uterotrophic assay.<h4>Conclusions</h4>We used the extensive ToxCast� HTS binding data set to show that OASIS ER and AR QSAR models had high sensitivity and specificity when compounds were in-domain of the models. Based on this research, we recommend a tiered screening approach wherein a) QSAR is used to identify compounds in-domain of the ER or AR binding models and predicted to bind; b) those compounds are screened in vitro to assess binding potency; and c) the stronger binders (AC50 < 1 �M) are screened in vivo. This scheme prioritizes compounds for integrative testing and risk assessment. Importantly, compounds that are not in-domain, that are predicted either not to bind or to bind weakly, that are not active in in vitro, that require metabolism to manifest activity, or for which in vivo AR testing is in order, need to be assessed differently.<h4>Citation</h4>Bhhatarai B, Wilson DM, Price PS, Marty S, Parks AK, Carney E. 2016.

27153703,Phasing for medical sequencing using rare variants and large haplotype reference panels.,"<h4>Motivation</h4>There is growing recognition that estimating haplotypes from high coverage sequencing of single samples in clinical settings is an important problem. At the same time very large datasets consisting of tens and hundreds of thousands of high-coverage sequenced samples will soon be available. We describe a method that takes advantage of these huge human genetic variation resources and rare variant sharing patterns to estimate haplotypes on single sequenced samples. Sharing rare variants between two individuals is more likely to arise from a recent common ancestor and, hence, also more likely to indicate similar shared haplotypes over a substantial flanking region of sequence.<h4>Results</h4>Our method exploits this idea to select a small set of highly informative copying states within a Hidden Markov Model (HMM) phasing algorithm. Using rare variants in this way allows us to avoid iterative MCMC methods to infer haplotypes. Compared to other approaches that do not explicitly use rare variants we obtain significant gains in phasing accuracy, less variation over phasing runs and improvements in speed. For example, using a reference panel of 7420 haplotypes from the UK10K project, we are able to reduce switch error rates by up to 50% when phasing samples sequenced at high-coverage. In addition, a single step rephasing of the UK10K panel, using rare variant information, has a downstream impact on phasing performance. These results represent a proof of concept that rare variant sharing patterns can be utilized to phase large high-coverage sequencing studies such as the 100 000 Genomes Project dataset.<h4>Availability and implementation</h4>A webserver that includes an implementation of this new method and allows phasing of high-coverage clinical samples is available at https://phasingserver.stats.ox.ac.uk/<h4>Contact</h4>marchini@stats.ox.ac.uk<h4>Supplementary information</h4>Supplementary data are available at Bioinformatics online.","kes, hji",0.0,0,0,2,0.0,,
27164621,Prioritizing Chemicals for Risk Assessment Using Chemoinformatics: Examples from the IARC Monographs on Pesticides.,"<h4>Background</h4>Identifying cancer hazards is the first step towards cancer prevention. The International Agency for Research on Cancer (IARC) Monographs Programme, which has evaluated nearly 1,000 agents for their carcinogenic potential since 1971, typically selects agents for hazard identification on the basis of public nominations, expert advice, published data on carcinogenicity, and public health importance.<h4>Objectives</h4>Here, we present a novel and complementary strategy for identifying agents for hazard evaluation using chemoinformatics, database integration, and automated text mining.<h4>Discussion</h4>To inform selection among a broad range of pesticides nominated for evaluation, we identified and screened nearly 6,000 relevant chemical structures, after which we systematically compiled information on 980 pesticides, creating network maps that allowed cluster visualization by chemical similarity, pesticide class, and publicly available information concerning cancer epidemiology, cancer bioassays, and carcinogenic mechanisms. For the IARC Monograph meetings that took place in March and June 2015, this approach supported high-priority evaluation of glyphosate, malathion, parathion, tetrachlorvinphos, diazinon, p,p'-dichlorodiphenyltrichloroethane (DDT), lindane, and 2,4-dichlorophenoxyacetic acid (2,4-D).<h4>Conclusions</h4>This systematic approach, accounting for chemical similarity and overlaying multiple data sources, can be used by risk assessors as well as by researchers to systematize, inform, and increase efficiency in selecting and prioritizing agents for hazard identification, risk assessment, regulation, or further investigation. This approach could be extended to an array of outcomes and agents, including occupational carcinogens, drugs, and foods. Citation: Guha N, Guyton KZ, Loomis D, Barupal DK. 2016.

27187006,Targeting vascular (endothelial) dysfunction.,"Cardiovascular diseases are major contributors to global deaths and disability-adjusted life years, with hypertension a significant risk factor for all causes of death. The endothelium that lines the inner wall of the vasculature regulates essential haemostatic functions, such as vascular tone, circulation of blood cells, inflammation and platelet activity. Endothelial dysfunction is an early predictor of atherosclerosis and future cardiovascular events. We review the prognostic value of obtaining measurements of endothelial function, the clinical techniques for its determination, the mechanisms leading to endothelial dysfunction and the therapeutic treatment of endothelial dysfunction. Since vascular oxidative stress and inflammation are major determinants of endothelial function, we have also addressed current antioxidant and anti-inflammatory therapies. In the light of recent data that dispute the prognostic value of endothelial function in healthy human cohorts, we also discuss alternative diagnostic parameters such as vascular stiffness index and intima/media thickness ratio. We also suggest that assessing vascular function, including that of smooth muscle and even perivascular adipose tissue, may be an appropriate parameter for clinical investigations.<h4>Linked articles</h4>This article is part of a themed section on Redox Biology and Oxidative Stress in Health and Disease.

27296980,Unbiased probabilistic taxonomic classification for DNA barcoding.,"<h4>Motivation</h4>When targeted to a barcoding region, high-throughput sequencing can be used to identify species or operational taxonomical units from environmental samples, and thus to study the diversity and structure of species communities. Although there are many methods which provide confidence scores for assigning taxonomic affiliations, it is not straightforward to translate these values to unbiased probabilities. We present a probabilistic method for taxonomical classification (PROTAX) of DNA sequences. Given a pre-defined taxonomical tree structure that is partially populated by reference sequences, PROTAX decomposes the probability of one to the set of all possible outcomes. PROTAX accounts for species that are present in the taxonomy but that do not have reference sequences, the possibility of unknown taxonomical units, as well as mislabeled reference sequences. PROTAX is based on a statistical multinomial regression model, and it can utilize any kind of sequence similarity measures or the outputs of other classifiers as predictors.<h4>Results</h4>We demonstrate the performance of PROTAX by using as predictors the output from BLAST, the phylogenetic classification software TIPP, and the RDP classifier. We show that PROTAX improves the predictions of the baseline implementations of TIPP and RDP classifiers, and that it is able to combine complementary information provided by BLAST and TIPP, resulting in accurate and unbiased classifications even with very challenging cases such as 50% mislabeling of reference sequences.<h4>Availability and implementation</h4>Perl/R implementation of PROTAX is available at http://www.helsinki.fi/science/metapop/Software.htm<h4>Contact</h4>panu.somervuo@helsinki.fi<h4>Supplementary information</h4>Supplementary data are available at Bioinformatics online.","kes, hji",0.0,0,0,2,0.0,,
27307608,Convolutional neural network architectures for predicting DNA-protein binding.,"<h4>Motivation</h4>Convolutional neural networks (CNN) have outperformed conventional methods in modeling the sequence specificity of DNA-protein binding. Yet inappropriate CNN architectures can yield poorer performance than simpler models. Thus an in-depth understanding of how to match CNN architecture to a given task is needed to fully harness the power of CNNs for computational biology applications.<h4>Results</h4>We present a systematic exploration of CNN architectures for predicting DNA sequence binding using a large compendium of transcription factor datasets. We identify the best-performing architectures by varying CNN width, depth and pooling designs. We find that adding convolutional kernels to a network is important for motif-based tasks. We show the benefits of CNNs in learning rich higher-order sequence features, such as secondary motifs and local sequence context, by comparing network performance on multiple modeling tasks ranging in difficulty. We also demonstrate how careful construction of sequence benchmark datasets, using approaches that control potentially confounding effects like positional or motif strength bias, is critical in making fair comparisons between competing methods. We explore how to establish the sufficiency of training data for these learning tasks, and we have created a flexible cloud-based framework that permits the rapid exploration of alternative neural network architectures for problems in computational biology.<h4>Availability and implementation</h4>All the models analyzed are available at http://cnn.csail.mit.edu<h4>Contact</h4>gifford@mit.edu<h4>Supplementary information</h4>Supplementary data are available at Bioinformatics online.","kes, hji",0.0,0,0,2,0.0,,
27307636,DFLpred: High-throughput prediction of disordered flexible linker regions in protein sequences.,"<h4>Motivation</h4>Disordered flexible linkers (DFLs) are disordered regions that serve as flexible linkers/spacers in multi-domain proteins or between structured constituents in domains. They are different from flexible linkers/residues because they are disordered and longer. Availability of experimentally annotated DFLs provides an opportunity to build high-throughput computational predictors of these regions from protein sequences. To date, there are no computational methods that directly predict DFLs and they can be found only indirectly by filtering predicted flexible residues with predictions of disorder.<h4>Results</h4>We conceptualized, developed and empirically assessed a first-of-its-kind sequence-based predictor of DFLs, DFLpred. This method outputs propensity to form DFLs for each residue in the input sequence. DFLpred uses a small set of empirically selected features that quantify propensities to form certain secondary structures, disordered regions and structured regions, which are processed by a fast linear model. Our high-throughput predictor can be used on the whole-proteome scale; it needs <1 h to predict entire proteome on a single CPU. When assessed on an independent test dataset with low sequence-identity proteins, it secures area under the receiver operating characteristic curve equal 0.715 and outperforms existing alternatives that include methods for the prediction of flexible linkers, flexible residues, intrinsically disordered residues and various combinations of these methods. Prediction on the complete human proteome reveals that about 10% of proteins have a large content of over 30% DFL residues. We also estimate that about 6000 DFL regions are long with =30 consecutive residues.<h4>Availability and implementation</h4>http://biomine.ece.ualberta.ca/DFLpred/<h4>Contact</h4>lkurgan@vcu.edu<h4>Supplementary information</h4>Supplementary data are available at Bioinformatics online.","kes, hji",0.0,0,0,2,0.0,,
27307645,BioASF: a framework for automatically generating executable pathway models specified in BioPAX.,"<h4>Motivation</h4>Biological pathways play a key role in most cellular functions. To better understand these functions, diverse computational and cell biology researchers use biological pathway data for various analysis and modeling purposes. For specifying these biological pathways, a community of researchers has defined BioPAX and provided various tools for creating, validating and visualizing BioPAX models. However, a generic software framework for simulating BioPAX models is missing. Here, we attempt to fill this gap by introducing a generic simulation framework for BioPAX. The framework explicitly separates the execution model from the model structure as provided by BioPAX, with the advantage that the modelling process becomes more reproducible and intrinsically more modular; this ensures natural biological constraints are satisfied upon execution. The framework is based on the principles of discrete event systems and multi-agent systems, and is capable of automatically generating a hierarchical multi-agent system for a given BioPAX model.<h4>Results</h4>To demonstrate the applicability of the framework, we simulated two types of biological network models: a gene regulatory network modeling the haematopoietic stem cell regulators and a signal transduction network modeling the Wnt/�-catenin signaling pathway. We observed that the results of the simulations performed using our framework were entirely consistent with the simulation results reported by the researchers who developed the original models in a proprietary language.<h4>Availability and implementation</h4>The framework, implemented in Java, is open source and its source code, documentation and tutorial are available at http://www.ibi.vu.nl/programs/BioASF CONTACT: j.heringa@vu.nl.","kes, hji",0.0,0,0,2,0.0,,

We tested the method on human contigs; using human UniProt proteins as guides, the improvement on N50 size was 17% increase with an accuracy of ~97%. PEP_scaffolder improved the proportion of fully covered proteins among all proteins, which was close to the proportion in the finished genome. The method provided a high accuracy of 91% using orthologs of distant species.

These data sources can be temporally limited, spatially aggregated, subjective, and burdensome for the patient to collect.<h4>Objectives</h4>First, we aimed to test the feasibility of collecting rescue inhaler use data in space-time using electronic sensors. Second, we aimed to evaluate whether these data have the potential to identify environmental triggers and built environment factors associated with rescue inhaler use and to determine whether these findings would be consistent with the existing literature.<h4>Methods</h4>We utilized zero-truncated negative binomial models to identify triggers associated with inhaler use, and implemented three sensitivity analyses to validate our findings.<h4>Results</h4>Electronic sensors fitted on metered dose inhalers tracked 5,660 rescue inhaler use events in space and time for 140 participants from 13 June 2012 to 28 February 2014. We found that the inhaler sensors were feasible in passively collecting objective rescue inhaler use data. We identified several environmental triggers with a positive and significant association with inhaler use, including: AQI, PM10, weed pollen, and mold. Conversely, the spatial distribution of tree cover demonstrated a negative and significant association with inhaler use.<h4>Conclusions</h4>Utilizing a sensor to capture the signal of rescue inhaler use in space-time offered a passive and objective signal of asthma activity. This approach enabled detailed analyses to identify environmental triggers and built environment factors that are associated with asthma symptoms beyond the residential address. The application of these new technologies has the potential to improve our surveillance and understanding of asthma.

27397138,Dynamic Bayesian Network for Accurate Detection of Peptides from Tandem Mass Spectra.,"A central problem in mass spectrometry analysis involves identifying, for each observed tandem mass spectrum, the corresponding generating peptide. We present a dynamic Bayesian network (DBN) toolkit that addresses this problem by using a machine learning approach. At the heart of this toolkit is a DBN for Rapid Identification (DRIP), which can be trained from collections of high-confidence peptide-spectrum matches (PSMs). DRIP's score function considers fragment ion matches using Gaussians rather than fixed fragment-ion tolerances and also finds the optimal alignment between the theoretical and observed spectrum by considering all possible alignments, up to a threshold that is controlled using a beam-pruning algorithm. This function not only yields state-of-the art database search accuracy but also can be used to generate features that significantly boost the performance of the Percolator postprocessor. The DRIP software is built upon a general purpose DBN toolkit (GMTK), thereby allowing a wide variety of options for user-specific inference tasks as well as facilitating easy modifications to the DRIP model in future work.

We developed a Korean fracture risk prediction model using clinical risk factors and assessed validity of the final model.<h4>Methods</h4>A total of 718,306 Korean men and women aged 50-90 years were followed for 7 years in a national system-based cohort study. In total, 50% of the subjects were assigned randomly to the development dataset and 50% were assigned to the validation dataset. Clinical risk factors for osteoporotic fracture were assessed at the biennial health check. Data on osteoporotic fractures during the follow-up period were identified by ICD-10 codes and the nationwide database of the National Health Insurance Service (NHIS).<h4>Results</h4>During the follow-up period, 19,840 osteoporotic fractures were reported (4,889 in men and 14,951 in women) in the development dataset. The assessment tool called the Korean Fracture Risk Score (KFRS) is comprised of a set of nine variables, including age, body mass index, recent fragility fracture, current smoking, high alcohol intake, lack of regular exercise, recent use of oral glucocorticoid, rheumatoid arthritis, and other causes of secondary osteoporosis. The KFRS predicted osteoporotic fractures over the 7 years. This score was validated using an independent dataset. A close relationship with overall fracture rate was observed when we compared the mean predicted scores after applying the KFRS with the observed risks after 7 years within each 10th of predicted risk.<h4>Conclusion</h4>We developed a Korean specific prediction model for osteoporotic fractures. The KFRS was able to predict risk of fracture in the primary population without bone mineral density testing and is therefore suitable for use in both clinical setting and self-assessment.

27430689,[Association between polymorphism in Vav3 genes and risk of primary prostatic cancer in Chinese Han population].,"<h4>Objective</h4>To study the associations between genetic variations of Vav3 gene and prostate cancer susceptibility.<h4>Methods</h4>Data were collected in a hospital-based and case-control study of 1 015 prostate cancer cases and 1 068 cancer-free controls collecting from a period of time between 2008 and 2012. Based on the online database, NCBI dbSNP (http: //www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/projects/SNP) and SNPinfo (http: //snpinfo.niehs.nih.gov/snpfunc.htm). Functional single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) of Vav3 were screened and genotyped, and assessed their associations with risk of prostate cancer by using logistic regression analysis. Furthermore, the associations between SNPs of Vav3 and some clinicopathological parameters were evaluated.<h4>Results</h4>Among the two SNPs investigated, only Vav3 rs12410676 G>A was associated with decreased prostate cancer risk [additive model, OR=0.80 (0.69-0.93), P=0.003; dominant model, OR=0.81 (0.68-0.97), P=0.022; recessive model, OR=0.54 (0.36-0.82), P=0.004]. The combined effect of Vav3 rs8676 G>A and rs12410676 G>A was found as a decreased prostate cancer risk along with the increased variant alleles (P<0.05). Specifically, participants carrying Vav3 rs12410676 AA/AG genotypes were more likely to be at lower prostate cancer risk, compared with participants carrying GG genotypes, in groups of BMI=25 kg/m(2,) smoking, Gleason>7(4+ 3), and higher invasive prostate cancer. Finally, some positive findings were evidently significant with false positive report probability values at different prior probability levels (0.25, 0.1 and 0.01).<h4>Conclusion</h4>Vav3 SNPs may contribute to the risk of prostate cancer in Eastern Chinese men, but the effect is weak and needs further validation by larger, multicenter and ethnic-based studies.","kes, hji",0.0,0,0,2,0.0,,
27460614,Classifying Schizophrenia Using Multimodal Multivariate Pattern Recognition Analysis: Evaluating the Impact of Individual Clinical Profiles on the Neurodiagnostic Performance.,"Previous studies have shown that structural brain changes are among the best-studied candidate markers for schizophrenia (SZ) along with functional connectivity (FC) alterations of resting-state (RS) patterns. This study aimed to investigate effects of clinical and sociodemographic variables on the classification by applying multivariate pattern analysis (MVPA) to both gray matter (GM) volume and FC measures in patients with SZ and healthy controls (HC). RS and structural magnetic resonance imaging data (sMRI) from 74 HC and 71 SZ patients were obtained from a Mind Research Network COBRE dataset available via COINS (http://coins.mrn.org/dx). We used a MVPA framework using support-vector machines embedded in a repeated, nested cross-validation to generate a multi-modal diagnostic system and evaluate its generalizability. The dependence of neurodiagnostic performance on clinical and sociodemographic variables was evaluated. The RS classifier showed a slightly higher accuracy (70.5%) compared to the structural classifier (69.7%). The combination of sMRI and RS outperformed single MRI modalities classification by reaching 75% accuracy. The RS based moderator analysis revealed that the neurodiagnostic performance was driven by older SZ patients with an earlier illness onset and more pronounced negative symptoms. In contrast, there was no linear relationship between the clinical variables and neuroanatomically derived group membership measures. This study achieved higher accuracy distinguishing HC from SZ patients by fusing 2 imaging modalities. In addition the results of RS based moderator analysis showed that age of patients, as well as their age at the illness onset were the most important clinical features.","kes, hji",0.0,0,0,2,0.0,,

The proposed method was evaluated on the set of compounds tested for acute rat toxicity with oral administration (7286 compounds) used for testing the known QSAR methods in T.E.S.T. 3.0 program (U.S. EPA). The several other sets of compounds tested for acute rat toxicity by different routes of administration selected from SYMYX MDL Toxicity Database were used too. The method was compared with the results of prediction of acute rodent toxicity for noncongeneric sets obtained by ACD/Labs Inc. The test sets were predicted with regards to the applicability domain. Comparison of accuracy for QSAR models obtained separately using QNA descriptors, PASS predictions, nearest neighbours' assessment with consensus models clearly demonstrated the benefits of consensus prediction. Free available web-service for prediction of LD50 values of rat acute toxicity was developed: http://www.pharmaexpert.ru/GUSAR/AcuToxPredict/.","kes, hji",0.0,0,0,2,0.0,,
27502039,Fascin Is Critical for the Maintenance of Breast Cancer Stem Cell Pool Predominantly via the Activation of the Notch Self-Renewal Pathway.,"An emerging dogma shows that tumors are initiated and maintained by a subpopulation of cancer cells that hijack some stem cell features and thus referred to as """"cancer stem cells"""" (CSCs). The exact mechanism that regulates the maintenance of CSC pool remains largely unknown. Fascin is an actin-bundling protein that we have previously demonstrated to be a major regulator of breast cancer chemoresistance and metastasis, two cardinal features of CSCs. Here, we manipulated fascin expression in breast cancer cell lines and used several in vitro and in vivo approaches to examine the relationship between fascin expression and breast CSCs. Fascin knockdown significantly reduced stem cell-like phenotype (CD44<sup>hi</sup> /CD24<sup>lo</sup> and ALDH<sup>+</sup> ) and reversal of epithelial to mesenchymal transition. Interestingly, expression of the embryonic stem cell transcriptional factors (Oct4, Nanog, Sox2, and Klf4) was significantly reduced when fascin expression was down-regulated. Functionally, fascin-knockdown cells were less competent in forming colonies and tumorspheres, consistent with lower basal self-renewal activity and higher susceptibility to chemotherapy. Fascin effect on CSC chemoresistance and self-renewability was associated with Notch signaling. Activation of Notch induced the relevant downstream targets predominantly in the fascin-positive cells. Limiting-dilution xenotransplantation assay showed higher frequency of tumor-initiating cells in the fascin-positive group. Collectively, our data demonstrated fascin as a critical regulator of breast CSC pool at least partially via activation of the Notch self-renewal signaling pathway and modification of the expression embryonic transcriptional factors. Targeting fascin may halt CSCs and thus presents a novel therapeutic approach for effective treatment of breast cancer.

27512621,Weighted K-means support vector machine for cancer prediction.,"To date, the support vector machine (SVM) has been widely applied to diverse bio-medical fields to address disease subtype identification and pathogenicity of genetic variants. In this paper, I propose the weighted K-means support vector machine (wKM-SVM) and weighted support vector machine (wSVM), for which I allow the SVM to impose weights to the loss term. Besides, I demonstrate the numerical relations between the objective function of the SVM and weights. Motivated by general ensemble techniques, which are known to improve accuracy, I directly adopt the boosting algorithm to the newly proposed weighted KM-SVM (and wSVM). For predictive performance, a range of simulation studies demonstrate that the weighted KM-SVM (and wSVM) with boosting outperforms the standard KM-SVM (and SVM) including but not limited to many popular classification rules. I applied the proposed methods to simulated data and two large-scale real applications in the TCGA pan-cancer methylation data of breast and kidney cancer. In conclusion, the weighted KM-SVM (and wSVM) increases accuracy of the classification model, and will facilitate disease diagnosis and clinical treatment decisions to benefit patients. A software package (wSVM) is publicly available at the R-project webpage (https://www.r-project.org).","kes, hji",0.0,0,0,2,0.0,,
27531102,iRSpot-EL: identify recombination spots with an ensemble learning approach.,"<h4>Motivation</h4>Coexisting in a DNA system, meiosis and recombination are two indispensible aspects for cell reproduction and growth. With the avalanche of genome sequences emerging in the post-genomic age, it is an urgent challenge to acquire the information of DNA recombination spots because it can timely provide very useful insights into the mechanism of meiotic recombination and the process of genome evolution.<h4>Results</h4>To address such a challenge, we have developed a predictor, called IRSPOT-EL: , by fusing different modes of pseudo K-tuple nucleotide composition and mode of dinucleotide-based auto-cross covariance into an ensemble classifier of clustering approach. Five-fold cross tests on a widely used benchmark dataset have indicated that the new predictor remarkably outperforms its existing counterparts. Particularly, far beyond their reach, the new predictor can be easily used to conduct the genome-wide analysis and the results obtained are quite consistent with the experimental map.<h4>Availability and implementation</h4>For the convenience of most experimental scientists, a user-friendly web-server for iRSpot-EL has been established at http://bioinformatics.hitsz.edu.cn/iRSpot-EL/, by which users can easily obtain their desired results without the need to go through the complicated mathematical equations involved.<h4>Contact</h4>bliu@gordonlifescience.org or bliu@insun.hit.edu.cnSupplementary information: Supplementary data are available at Bioinformatics online.","kes, hji",0.0,0,0,2,0.0,,
27559155,Fast-SNP: a fast matrix pre-processing algorithm for efficient loopless flux optimization of metabolic models.,"<h4>Motivation</h4>Computation of steady-state flux solutions in large metabolic models is routinely performed using flux balance analysis based on a simple LP (Linear Programming) formulation. A minimal requirement for thermodynamic feasibility of the flux solution is the absence of internal loops, which are enforced using 'loopless constraints'. The resulting loopless flux problem is a substantially harder MILP (Mixed Integer Linear Programming) problem, which is computationally expensive for large metabolic models.<h4>Results</h4>We developed a pre-processing algorithm that significantly reduces the size of the original loopless problem into an easier and equivalent MILP problem. The pre-processing step employs a fast matrix sparsification algorithm-Fast- sparse null-space pursuit (SNP)-inspired by recent results on SNP. By finding a reduced feasible 'loop-law' matrix subject to known directionalities, Fast-SNP considerably improves the computational efficiency in several metabolic models running different loopless optimization problems. Furthermore, analysis of the topology encoded in the reduced loop matrix enabled identification of key directional constraints for the potential permanent elimination of infeasible loops in the underlying model. Overall, Fast-SNP is an effective and simple algorithm for efficient formulation of loop-law constraints, making loopless flux optimization feasible and numerically tractable at large scale.<h4>Availability and implementation</h4>Source code for MATLAB including examples is freely available for download at http://www.aibn.uq.edu.au/cssb-resources under Software.

27596593,Order restricted inference for oscillatory systems for detecting rhythmic signals.,"<h4>Motivation</h4>Many biological processes, such as cell cycle, circadian clock, menstrual cycles, are governed by oscillatory systems consisting of numerous components that exhibit rhythmic patterns over time. It is not always easy to identify such rhythmic components. For example, it is a challenging problem to identify circadian genes in a given tissue using time-course gene expression data. There is a great potential for misclassifying non-rhythmic as rhythmic genes and vice versa. This has been a problem of considerable interest in recent years. In this article we develop a constrained inference based methodology called Order Restricted Inference for Oscillatory Systems (ORIOS) to detect rhythmic signals. Instead of using mathematical functions (e.g. sinusoidal) to describe shape of rhythmic signals, ORIOS uses mathematical inequalities. Consequently, it is robust and not limited by the biologist's choice of the mathematical model. We studied the performance of ORIOS using simulated as well as real data obtained from mouse liver, pituitary gland and data from NIH3T3, U2OS cell lines. Our results suggest that, for a broad collection of patterns of gene expression, ORIOS has substantially higher power to detect true rhythmic genes in comparison to some popular methods, while also declaring substantially fewer non-rhythmic genes as rhythmic.<h4>Availability and implementation</h4>A user friendly code implemented in R language can be downloaded from http://www.niehs.nih.gov/research/atniehs/labs/bb/staff/peddada/index.cfm CONTACT: peddada@niehs.nih.gov.","kes, hji",0.0,0,0,2,0.0,,
27597880,Functional networks inference from rule-based machine learning models.,"<h4>Background</h4>Functional networks play an important role in the analysis of biological processes and systems. The inference of these networks from high-throughput (-omics) data is an area of intense research. So far, the similarity-based inference paradigm (e.g. gene co-expression) has been the most popular approach. It assumes a functional relationship between genes which are expressed at similar levels across different samples. An alternative to this paradigm is the inference of relationships from the structure of machine learning models. These models are able to capture complex relationships between variables, that often are different/complementary to the similarity-based methods.<h4>Results</h4>We propose a protocol to infer functional networks from machine learning models, called FuNeL. It assumes, that genes used together within a rule-based machine learning model to classify the samples, might also be functionally related at a biological level. The protocol is first tested on synthetic datasets and then evaluated on a test suite of 8 real-world datasets related to human cancer. The networks inferred from the real-world data are compared against gene co-expression networks of equal size, generated with 3 different methods. The comparison is performed from two different points of view. We analyse the enriched biological terms in the set of network nodes and the relationships between known disease-associated genes in a context of the network topology. The comparison confirms both the biological relevance and the complementary character of the knowledge captured by the FuNeL networks in relation to similarity-based methods and demonstrates its potential to identify known disease associations as core elements of the network. Finally, using a prostate cancer dataset as a case study, we confirm that the biological knowledge captured by our method is relevant to the disease and consistent with the specialised literature and with an independent dataset not used in the inference process.<h4>Availability</h4>The implementation of our network inference protocol is available at: http://ico2s.org/software/funel.html.","kes, hji",0.0,0,0,2,0.0,,
27604408,ExonImpact: Prioritizing Pathogenic Alternative Splicing Events.,"Alternative splicing (AS) is a closely regulated process that allows a single gene to encode multiple protein isoforms, thereby contributing to the diversity of the proteome. Dysregulation of the splicing process has been found to be associated with many inherited diseases. However, among the pathogenic AS events, there are numerous """"passenger"""" events whose inclusion or exclusion does not lead to significant changes with respect to protein function. In this study, we evaluate the secondary and tertiary structural features of proteins associated with disease-causing and neutral AS events, and show that several structural features are strongly associated with the pathological impact of exon inclusion. We further develop a machine-learning-based computational model, ExonImpact, for prioritizing and evaluating the functional consequences of hitherto uncharacterized AS events. We evaluated our model using several strategies including cross-validation, and data from the Gene-Tissue Expression (GTEx) and ClinVar databases.

Delile, 1813, is the most widespread seagrass of the Mediterranean Sea. This foundation species forms large meadows that, through habitat and trophic services, act as biodiversity hotspots. In Neptune grass meadows, amphipod crustaceans are one of the dominant groups of vagile invertebrates, forming an abundant and diverse taxocenosis. They are key ecological components of the complex, pivotal, yet critically endangered Neptune grass ecosystems. Nevertheless, comprehensive qualitative and quantitative data about amphipod fauna found in Mediterranean Neptune grass meadows remain scarce, especially in insular locations.<h4>New information</h4>Here, we provide in-depth metadata about AxIOM, a sample-based dataset published on the GBIF portal. AxIOM is based on an extensive and spatially hierarchized sampling design with multiple years, seasons, day periods, and methods. Samples were taken along the coasts of Calvi Bay (Corsica, France) and of the Tavolara-Punta Coda Cavallo Marine Protected Area (Sardinia, Italy). In total, AxIOM contains 187 samples documenting occurrence (1775 records) and abundance (10720 specimens) of amphipod crustaceans belonging to 72 species spanning 29 families.

27660889,MINFIT: A Spreadsheet-Based Tool for Parameter Estimation in an Equilibrium Speciation Software Program.,"Determination of equilibrium constants describing chemical reactions in the aqueous phase and at solid-water interface relies on inverse modeling and parameter estimation. Although there are existing tools available, the steep learning curve prevents the wider community of environmental engineers and chemists to adopt those tools. Stemming from classical chemical equilibrium codes, MINEQL+ has been one of the most widely used chemical equilibrium software programs. We developed a spreadsheet-based tool, which we are calling MINFIT, that interacts with MINEQL+ to perform parameter estimations that optimize model fits to experimental data sets. MINFIT enables automatic and convenient screening of a large number of parameter sets toward the optimal solutions by calling MINEQL+ to perform iterative forward calculations following either exhaustive equidistant grid search or randomized search algorithms. The combined use of the two algorithms can securely guide the searches for the global optima. We developed interactive interfaces so that the optimization processes are transparent. Benchmark examples including both aqueous and surface complexation problems illustrate the parameter estimation and associated sensitivity analysis.

Experience and data of already existing monitoring networks should be included. The present paper summarizes the major findings of a project funded by the Federal Agency for Nature Conservation (Nutzungsm�glichkeiten der Boden-Dauerbeobachtung der L�nder f�r das Monitoring der Umweltwirkungen gentechnisch ver�nderter Pflanzen. BfN Skripten, Bonn-Bad Godesberg 369, 2014). The full report in german language can be accessed on http://www.bfn.de�and is available as Additional file 1. The aim of the project was to check if it is possible to use the German permanent soil monitoring program (PSM) for the monitoring of GMO. Soil organism communities are highly diverse and relevant with respect to the sustainability of soil functions. They are exposed to GMO material directly by feeding or indirectly through food chain interactions. Other impacts are possible due to their close association to soil particles.<h4>Results</h4>The PSM program can be considered as representative with regard to different soil types and ecoregions in Germany, but not for all habitat types relevant for soil organisms. Nevertheless, it is suitable as a basic grid for monitoring the potential effects of GMO on soil invertebrates.<h4>Conclusions</h4>PSM sites should be used to derive reference values, i.e. range of abundance and presence of different relevant species of soil organisms. Based on these references, it is possible to derive threshold values to define the limit of acceptable change or impact. Therefore, a minimum set of sites and minimum set of standardized methods are needed, i.e. characterization of each site, sampling of selected soil organism groups, adequate adaptation of methods for the purpose of monitoring of potential effects of GMO. Finally, and probably most demanding, it is needed to develop a harmonized evaluation concept.","kes, hji",0.0,0,0,2,0.0,,
27796840,An IoT-cloud Based Wearable ECG Monitoring System for Smart Healthcare.,"Public healthcare has been paid an increasing attention given the exponential growth human population and medical expenses. It is well known that an effective health monitoring system can detect abnormalities of health conditions in time and make diagnoses according to the gleaned data. As a vital approach to diagnose heart diseases, ECG monitoring is widely studied and applied. However, nearly all existing portable ECG monitoring systems cannot work without a mobile application, which is responsible for data collection and display. In this paper, we propose a new method for ECG monitoring based on Internet-of-Things (IoT) techniques. ECG data are gathered using a wearable monitoring node and are transmitted directly to the IoT cloud using Wi-Fi. Both the HTTP and MQTT protocols are employed in the IoT cloud in order to provide visual and timely ECG data to users. Nearly all smart terminals with a web browser can acquire ECG data conveniently, which has greatly alleviated the cross-platform issue. Experiments are carried out on healthy volunteers in order to verify the reliability of the entire system. Experimental results reveal that the proposed system is reliable in collecting and displaying real-time ECG data, which can aid in the primary diagnosis of certain heart diseases.","kes, hji",0.0,0,0,2,0.0,,

27976886,MIB: Metal Ion-Binding Site Prediction and Docking Server.,"The structure of a protein determines its biological function(s) and its interactions with other factors; the binding regions tend to be conserved in sequence and structure, and the interacting residues involved are usually in close 3D space. The Protein Data Bank currently contains more than 110�000 protein structures, approximately one-third of which contain metal ions. Identifying and characterizing metal ion-binding sites is thus essential for investigating a protein's function(s) and interactions. However, experimental approaches are time-consuming and costly. The web server reported here was built to predict metal ion-binding residues and to generate the predicted metal ion-bound 3D structure. Binding templates have been constructed for regions that bind 12 types of metal ion-binding residues have been used to construct binding templates. The templates include residues within 3.5 � of the metal ion, and the fragment transformation method was used for structural comparison between query proteins and templates without any data training.

28130241,Classification of RNA structure change by 'gazing' at experimental data.,"<h4>Motivation</h4>Mutations (or Single Nucleotide Variants) in folded RiboNucleic Acid structures that cause local or global conformational change are riboSNitches. Predicting riboSNitches is challenging, as it requires making two, albeit related, structure predictions. The data most often used to experimentally validate riboSNitch predictions is Selective 2' Hydroxyl Acylation by Primer Extension, or SHAPE. Experimentally establishing a riboSNitch requires the quantitative comparison of two SHAPE traces: wild-type (WT) and mutant. Historically, SHAPE data was collected on electropherograms and change in structure was evaluated by 'gel gazing.' SHAPE data is now routinely collected with next generation sequencing and/or capillary sequencers. We aim to establish a classifier capable of simulating human 'gazing' by identifying features of the SHAPE profile that human experts agree 'looks' like a riboSNitch.<h4>Results</h4>We find strong quantitative agreement between experts when RNA scientists 'gaze' at SHAPE data and identify riboSNitches. We identify dynamic time warping and seven other features predictive of the human consensus. The classSNitch classifier reported here accurately reproduces human consensus for 167 mutant/WT comparisons with an Area Under the Curve (AUC) above 0.8. When we analyze 2019 mutant traces for 17 different RNAs, we find that features of the WT SHAPE reactivity allow us to improve thermodynamic structure predictions of riboSNitches.

28137292,Correcting for cell-type effects in DNA methylation studies: reference-based method outperforms latent variable approaches in empirical studies.,"Based on an extensive simulation study, McGregor and colleagues recently recommended the use of surrogate variable analysis (SVA) to control for the confounding effects of cell-type heterogeneity in DNA methylation association studies in scenarios where no cell-type proportions are available. As their recommendation was mainly based on simulated data, we sought to replicate findings in two large-scale empirical studies. In our empirical data, SVA did not fully correct for cell-type effects, its performance was somewhat unstable, and it carried a risk of missing true signals caused by removing variation that might be linked to actual disease processes. By contrast, a reference-based correction method performed well and did not show these limitations. A disadvantage of this approach is that if reference methylomes are not (publicly) available, they will need to be generated once for a small set of samples. However, given the notable risk we observed for cell-type confounding, we argue that, to avoid introducing false-positive findings into the literature, it could be well worth making this investment.Please see related Correspondence article: https://genomebiology.biomedcentral.com/articles/10/1186/s13059-017-1149-7 and related Research article: https://genomebiology.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s13059-016-0935-y.","kes, hji",0.0,0,0,2,0.0,,

We first downloaded a gene expression profile dataset GSE29721 (10 HCC and 10 control samples) from Gene Expression Omnibus database (http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/). Differentially expressed genes (DEGs) were identified by the paired t-test using limma package. Pathway and functional enrichment analyses were performed with DAVID tools. Transcription factors were annotated with TRANSFAC database and tumor associated genes (TAGs) were annotated with TAG and TSGene databases. Protein-protein interaction (PPI) network was conducted using STRING online tool and function module was further identified with BioNet package. Totally, 527 up-regulated DEGs and 587 down-regulated DEGs were identified. GO functional and KEGG pathway enrichment analyses showed that the up-regulated DEGs were mainly related to cell division and cell cycle, while the down-regulated DEGs were largely related to material metabolism, especially secondary metabolism. Proteins encoded by DEGs CDK1, BUB1, CDC20, NCAPG, NDC80, CDCA8, MAD2L1, CCNB1, CCNA2 and BIRC5 were hub genes with high degrees in the PPI network; further module analysis detected a subnetwork consisting of 55 proteins, such as CYP2B6, ACAA1, BHMT and ALDH2. Taken together, aberrant expression of cell cycle related genes (e.g., CDK1, CCNA2, CCNB1, BUB1, MAD2L1 and CDC20) and material metabolism related genes (e.g., CYP2B6, ACAA1, BHMT and ALDH2) may contribute to HCC occurrence.","kes, hji",0.0,0,0,2,0.0,,references other data resource

Joint kinematics and kinetics processed within the toolbox were found to be similar to outputs from a commercial system. The biomechZoo toolbox represents the work of several years and multiple contributors to provide a flexible platform to examine time-series data sets typical in the movement sciences. The toolbox has previously been used to process and analyse walking, running, and ice hockey data sets, and can integrate existing routines, such as the KineMat toolbox, for additional analyses. The toolbox can help researchers and clinicians new to programming or biomechanics to process and analyze their data through a customizable workflow, while advanced users are encouraged to contribute additional functionality to the project. Students may benefit from using biomechZoo as a learning and research tool. It is hoped that the toolbox can play a role in advancing research in the movement sciences. The biomechZoo m-files, sample data, and help repositories are available online (http://www.biomechzoo.com) under the Apache 2.0 License. The toolbox is supported for Matlab (r2014b or newer, The Mathworks Inc., Natick, USA) for Windows (Microsoft Corp., Redmond, USA) and Mac OS (Apple Inc., Cupertino, USA).","kes, hji",0.0,0,0,2,0.0,,
28263273,Hospital Administration and Nursing Leadership in Disasters: An Exploratory Study Using Concept Mapping.,"Strong leadership is critical in disaster situations when """"patient surge"""" challenges a hospital's capacity to respond and normally acceptable patterns of care are disrupted. Activation of the emergency operations plan triggers an incident command system structure for leadership decision making. Yet, implementation of the emergency operations plan and incident command system protocols is ultimately subject to nursing and hospital leadership at the service- and unit level. The results of these service-/unit-based leadership decisions have the potential to directly impact staff and patient safety, quality of care, and ultimately, patient outcomes. Despite the critical nature of these events, nurse leaders and administrators receive little education regarding leadership and decision making during disaster events. The purpose of this study is to identify essential competencies of nursing and hospital administrators' leadership during disaster events. An integrative mixed-methods design combining qualitative and quantitative approaches to data collection and analysis was used. Five focus groups were conducted with nurse leaders and hospital administrators at a large urban hospital in the Northeastern United States in a collaborative group process to generate relevant leadership competencies. Concept Systems Incorporated was used to sort, prioritize, and analyze the data (http://conceptsystemsinc.com/). The results suggest that participants' institutional knowledge (of existing resources, communications, processes) and prior disaster experience increase leadership competence.","kes, hji",0.0,0,0,2,0.0,,
28409825,Targeting inflammation to reduce cardiovascular disease risk: a realistic clinical prospect?,"Data from basic science experiments is overwhelmingly supportive of the causal role of immune-inflammatory response(s) at the core of atherosclerosis, and therefore, the theoretical potential to manipulate the inflammatory response to prevent cardiovascular events. However, extrapolation to humans requires care and we still lack definitive evidence to show that interfering in immune-inflammatory processes may safely lessen clinical atherosclerosis. In this review, we discuss key therapeutic targets in the treatment of vascular inflammation, placing basic research in a wider clinical perspective, as well as identifying outstanding questions.<h4>Linked articles</h4>This article is part of a themed section on Targeting Inflammation to Reduce Cardiovascular Disease Risk.

28426817,Evaluation of machine learning algorithms and structural features for optimal MRI-based diagnostic prediction in psychosis.,"A relatively large number of studies have investigated the power of structural magnetic resonance imaging (sMRI) data to discriminate patients with schizophrenia from healthy controls. However, very few of them have also included patients with bipolar disorder, allowing the clinically relevant discrimination between both psychotic diagnostics. To assess the efficacy of sMRI data for diagnostic prediction in psychosis we objectively evaluated the discriminative power of a wide range of commonly used machine learning algorithms (ridge, lasso, elastic net and L0 norm regularized logistic regressions, a support vector classifier, regularized discriminant analysis, random forests and a Gaussian process classifier) on main sMRI features including grey and white matter voxel-based morphometry (VBM), vertex-based cortical thickness and volume, region of interest volumetric measures and wavelet-based morphometry (WBM) maps. All possible combinations of algorithms and data features were considered in pairwise classifications of matched samples of healthy controls (N = 127), patients with schizophrenia (N = 128) and patients with bipolar disorder (N = 128). Results show that the selection of feature type is important, with grey matter VBM (without data reduction) delivering the best diagnostic prediction rates (averaging over classifiers: schizophrenia vs. healthy 75%, bipolar disorder vs. healthy 63% and schizophrenia vs. bipolar disorder 62%) whereas algorithms usually yielded very similar results. Indeed, those grey matter VBM accuracy rates were not even improved by combining all feature types in a single prediction model. Further multi-class classifications considering the three groups simultaneously made evident a lack of predictive power for the bipolar group, probably due to its intermediate anatomical features, located between those observed in healthy controls and those found in patients with schizophrenia. Finally, we provide MRIPredict (https://www.nitrc.org/projects/mripredict/), a free tool for SPM, FSL and R, to easily carry out voxelwise predictions based on VBM images.","kes, hji",0.0,0,0,2,0.0,,
28453624,Inferring Rates and Length-Distributions of Indels Using Approximate Bayesian Computation.,"The most common evolutionary events at the molecular level are single-base substitutions, as well as insertions and deletions (indels) of short DNA segments. A large body of research has been devoted to develop probabilistic substitution models and to infer their parameters using likelihood and Bayesian approaches. In contrast, relatively little has been done to model indel dynamics, probably due to the difficulty in writing explicit likelihood functions. Here, we contribute to the effort of modeling indel dynamics by presenting SpartaABC, an approximate Bayesian computation (ABC) approach to infer indel parameters from sequence data (either aligned or unaligned). SpartaABC circumvents the need to use an explicit likelihood function by extracting summary statistics from simulated sequences. First, summary statistics are extracted from the input sequence data. Second, SpartaABC samples indel parameters from a prior distribution and uses them to simulate sequences. Third, it computes summary statistics from the simulated sets of sequences. By computing a distance between the summary statistics extracted from the input and each simulation, SpartaABC can provide an approximation to the posterior distribution of indel parameters as well as point estimates. We study the performance of our methodology and show that it provides accurate estimates of indel parameters in simulations. We next demonstrate the utility of SpartaABC by studying the impact of alignment errors on the inference of positive selection.

28462382,GATA4 Is Sufficient to Establish Jejunal Versus Ileal Identity in the Small Intestine.,"<h4>Background & aims</h4>Patterning of the small intestinal epithelium along its cephalocaudal axis establishes three functionally distinct regions: duodenum, jejunum, and ileum. Efficient nutrient assimilation and growth depend on the proper spatial patterning of specialized digestive and absorptive functions performed by duodenal, jejunal, and ileal enterocytes. When enterocyte function is disrupted by disease or injury, intestinal failure can occur. One approach to alleviate intestinal failure would be to restore lost enterocyte functions. The molecular mechanisms determining regionally defined enterocyte functions, however, are poorly delineated. We previously showed that GATA binding protein 4 (GATA4) is essential to define jejunal enterocytes. The goal of this study was to test the hypothesis that GATA4 is sufficient to confer jejunal identity within the intestinal epithelium.<h4>Methods</h4>To test this hypothesis, we generated a novel <i>Gata4</i> conditional knock-in mouse line and expressed GATA4 in the ileum, where it is absent.<h4>Results</h4>We found that GATA4-expressing ileum lost ileal identity. The global gene expression profile of GATA4-expressing ileal epithelium aligned more closely with jejunum and duodenum rather than ileum. Focusing on jejunal vs ileal identity, we defined sets of jejunal and ileal genes likely to be regulated directly by GATA4 to suppress ileal identity and promote jejunal identity. Furthermore, our study implicates GATA4 as a transcriptional repressor of <i>fibroblast growth factor 15 (Fgf15)</i>, which encodes an enterokine that has been implicated in an increasing number of human diseases.<h4>Conclusions</h4>Overall, this study refines our understanding of an important GATA4-dependent molecular mechanism to pattern the intestinal epithelium along its cephalocaudal axis by elaborating on GATA4's function as a crucial dominant molecular determinant of jejunal enterocyte identity.

28472230,OMSim: a simulator for optical map data.,"<h4>Motivation</h4>The Bionano Genomics platform allows for the optical detection of short sequence patterns in very long DNA molecules (up to 2.5 Mbp). Molecules with overlapping patterns can be assembled to generate a consensus optical map of the entire genome. In turn, these optical maps can be used to validate or improve de novo genome assembly projects or to detect large-scale structural variation in genomes. Simulated optical map data can assist in the development and benchmarking of tools that operate on those data, such as alignment and assembly software. Additionally, it can help to optimize the experimental setup for a genome of interest. Such a simulator is currently not available.<h4>Results</h4>We have developed a simulator, OMSim, that produces synthetic optical map data that mimics real Bionano Genomics data. These simulated data have been tested for compatibility with the Bionano Genomics Irys software system and the Irys-scaffolding scripts. OMSim is capable of handling very large genomes (over 30 Gbp) with high throughput and low memory requirements.<h4>Availability and implementation</h4>The Python simulation tool and a cross-platform graphical user interface are available as open source software under the GNU GPL v2 license ( http://www.bioinformatics.intec.ugent.be/omsim ).<h4>Contact</h4>jan.fostier@ugent.be.<h4>Supplementary information</h4>Supplementary data are available at Bioinformatics online.","kes, hji",0.0,0,0,2,0.0,,
28472263,A deep learning framework for improving long-range residue-residue contact prediction using a hierarchical strategy.,"<h4>Motivation</h4>Residue-residue contacts are of great value for protein structure prediction, since contact information, especially from those long-range residue pairs, can significantly reduce the complexity of conformational sampling for protein structure prediction in practice. Despite progresses in the past decade on protein targets with abundant homologous sequences, accurate contact prediction for proteins with limited sequence information is still far from satisfaction. Methodologies for these hard targets still need further improvement.<h4>Results</h4>We presented a computational program DeepConPred, which includes a pipeline of two novel deep-learning-based methods (DeepCCon and DeepRCon) as well as a contact refinement step, to improve the prediction of long-range residue contacts from primary sequences. When compared with previous prediction approaches, our framework employed an effective scheme to identify optimal and important features for contact prediction, and was only trained with coevolutionary information derived from a limited number of homologous sequences to ensure robustness and usefulness for hard targets. Independent tests showed that 59.33%/49.97%, 64.39%/54.01% and 70.00%/59.81% of the top L/5, top L/10 and top 5 predictions were correct for CASP10/CASP11 proteins, respectively. In general, our algorithm ranked as one of the best methods for CASP targets.<h4>Availability and implementation</h4>All source data and codes are available at http://166.111.152.91/Downloads.html .<h4>Contact</h4>hgong@tsinghua.edu.cn or zengjy321@tsinghua.edu.cn.<h4>Supplementary information</h4>Supplementary data are available at Bioinformatics online.","kes, hji",0.0,0,0,2,0.0,,
28490512,Preconceptional and gestational weight trajectories and risk of delivering a small-for-gestational-age baby in rural Gambia.,"<b>Background:</b> Maternal nutritional status is a key determinant of small for gestational age (SGA), but some knowledge gaps remain, particularly regarding the role of the energy balance entering pregnancy.<b>Objective:</b> We investigated how preconceptional and gestational weight trajectories (summarized by individual-level traits) are associated with SGA risk in rural Gambia.<b>Design:</b> The sample comprised 670 women in a trial with serial weight data (7310 observations) that were available before and during pregnancy. Individual trajectories from 6 mo before conception to 30 wk of gestation were produced with the use of multilevel modeling. Summary traits were expressed as weight <i>z</i> scores [weight <i>z</i> score at 3 mo preconception (<i>z</i>wt<sub>-3 mo</sub>), weight <i>z</i> score at conception, weight <i>z</i> score at 3 mo postconception, weight <i>z</i> score at 7 mo postconception (<i>z</i>wt<sub>+7 mo</sub>), and conditional measures that represented the change from the preceding time] and were related to SGA risk with the use of Poisson regression with confounder adjustment; linear splines were used to account for nonlinearity.<b>Results:</b> Maternal weight at each time point had a consistent nonlinear relation with SGA risk. For example, the <i>z</i>wt<sub>-3 mo</sub> estimate was stronger in women with values =0.5 (RR: 0.736; 95% CI: 0.594, 0.910) than in women with values >0.5 (RR: 0.920; 95% CI: 0.682, 1.241). The former group had the highest observed SGA prevalence. Focusing on weight change, only conditional <i>z</i>wt<sub>+7 mo</sub> was associated with SGA and only in women with values >-0.5 (RR: 0.579; 95% CI: 0.463, 0.724).<b>Conclusions:</b> Protection against delivering an SGA neonate offered by greater preconceptional or gestational weight may be most pronounced in more undernourished and vulnerable women. Independent of this possibility, greater second- and third-trimester weight gain beyond a threshold may be protective.

Kindergarten/elementary school educators could play an important role in teaching students about oral health promotion. The objectives were to assess which oral health-related web-based resources teachers consider most helpful and how teachers' attitudes, knowledge, and behavioural intentions concerning oral health-related teaching change between before and after having access to a resource website.<h4>Materials and methods</h4>Web-based survey data were collected from 95 kindergarten/elementary school educators before and after they accessed a website with oral health-related information for teachers (web-link: http://media.dent.umich.edu/teachoralhealth/index.html).<h4>Results</h4>Most teachers accessed lesson plans about 'Teeth and smiling' (90%) and 'Taking care of your teeth' (88%) and the fewest accessed information about 'Nutrition and health' (42%) and 'Information for parents' (39%). On average, all materials were perceived as useful (5-point scale with 5�=�'very useful', range�=�3.80 to 4.04). Responses to the question on how important dental health is for a child's ability to learn improved significantly from before to after the educational intervention (5-point scale with 5�=�'very important', 3.78 vs 4.44). Knowledge increased and behavioural intentions improved as well. The percentage of teachers who reported that they had included oral health-related material in the past was 47% and the percentage who intended to include it in the future was 65% (p�<�0.001).<h4>Conclusions</h4>Providing kindergarten/elementary school educators with web-based resource materials improves their attitudes, increases their knowledge and leads to positive behavioural intentions concerning educating their students about oral health.","kes, hji",0.0,0,0,2,0.0,,
28537071,CLMSVault: A Software Suite for Protein Cross-Linking Mass-Spectrometry Data Analysis and Visualization.,"Protein cross-linking mass spectrometry (CL-MS) enables the sensitive detection of protein interactions and the inference of protein complex topology. The detection of chemical cross-links between protein residues can identify intra- and interprotein contact sites or provide physical constraints for molecular modeling of protein structure. Recent innovations in cross-linker design, sample preparation, mass spectrometry, and software tools have significantly improved CL-MS approaches. Although a number of algorithms now exist for the identification of cross-linked peptides from mass spectral data, a dearth of user-friendly analysis tools represent a practical bottleneck to the broad adoption of the approach. To facilitate the analysis of CL-MS data, we developed CLMSVault, a software suite designed to leverage existing CL-MS algorithms and provide intuitive and flexible tools for cross-platform data interpretation. CLMSVault stores and combines complementary information obtained from different cross-linkers and search algorithms. CLMSVault provides filtering, comparison, and visualization tools to support CL-MS analyses and includes a workflow for label-free quantification of cross-linked peptides. An embedded 3D viewer enables the visualization of quantitative data and the mapping of cross-linked sites onto PDB structural models. We demonstrate the application of CLMSVault for the analysis of a noncovalent Cdc34-ubiquitin protein complex cross-linked under different conditions.

Cost-utility analyses provide information on the relative value of different screening options. The aim of this project was to develop an open access risk assessment and cost-utility analysis web-tool for assessing HIV, HCV and HBV screening options (http://www.isbtweb.org/working-parties/transfusion-transmitted-infectious-diseases/). An analysis for six countries (Brazil, Ghana, the Netherlands, South Africa, Thailand and USA) was conducted.<h4>Materials and methods</h4>Four strategies; (1) antibody assays (Abs) for HIV and HCV + HBsAg, (2) antibody assays that include antigens for HIV and HCV (Combo) + HBsAg, (3) NAT in minipools of variable size (MP NAT) and (4) individual donation (ID) NAT can be evaluated using the tool. Country-specific data on donors, donation testing results, recipient outcomes and costs are entered using the online interface. Results obtained include the number infections interdicted using each screening options, and the (incremental and average) cost-utility of the options.<h4>Results</h4>In each of the six countries evaluated, the use of antibody assays is cost effective or even cost saving. NAT has varying cost-utility depending on the setting, and where adopted, the incremental cost-utility exceeds any previously defined or proposed threshold in each country.<h4>Conclusion</h4>The web-tool allows an assessment of infectious units interdicted and value for money of different testing strategies.

A major obstacle in writing complex models for physiological processes is the large amount of time it takes to model the myriad processes taking place simultaneously in cells, tissues, and organs. MPC replaces this task with code-generating algorithms that take model code from several different existing models and produce model code for a new JSim model. This is particularly useful during multi-scale model development where many variants are to be configured and tested against data. MPC encodes and preserves information about how a model is built from its simpler model modules, allowing the researcher to quickly substitute or update modules for hypothesis testing.

28711973,PIWI-interacting RNAs as novel regulators of pancreatic beta cell function.,"<h4>Aims/hypothesis</h4>P-element induced Wimpy testis (PIWI)-interacting RNAs (piRNAs) are small non-coding RNAs that interact with PIWI proteins and guide them to silence transposable elements. They are abundantly expressed in germline cells and play key roles in spermatogenesis. There is mounting evidence that piRNAs are also present in somatic cells, where they may accomplish additional regulatory tasks. The aim of this study was to identify the piRNAs expressed in pancreatic islets and to determine whether they are involved in the control of beta cell activities.<h4>Methods</h4>piRNA profiling of rat pancreatic islets was performed by microarray analysis. The functions of piRNAs were investigated by silencing the two main Piwi genes or by modulating the level of selected piRNAs in islet cells.<h4>Results</h4>We detected about 18,000 piRNAs in rat pancreatic islets, many of which were differentially expressed throughout islet postnatal development. Moreover, we identified changes in the level of several piRNAs in the islets of Goto-Kakizaki rats, a well-established animal model of type 2 diabetes. Silencing of Piwil2 or Piwil4 genes in adult rat islets caused a reduction in the level of several piRNAs and resulted in defective insulin secretion and increased resistance of the cells to cytokine-induced cell death. Furthermore, overexpression in the islets of control animals of two piRNAs that are upregulated in diabetic rats led to a selective defect in glucose-induced insulin release.<h4>Conclusions/interpretation</h4>Our results provide evidence for a role of PIWI proteins and their associated piRNAs in the control of beta cell functions, and suggest a possible involvement in the development of type 2 diabetes.<h4>Data availability</h4>Data have been deposited in Gene Expression Omnibus repository under the accession number GSE93792.

28787666,ERas is constitutively expressed in full term placenta of pregnant cows.,"ERas is a new gene recently found in mouse embryonic stem (ES) cells and localized on the X chromosome. It plays a role in mouse ES cell survival and is constitutively active without any mutations. It was also found to be responsible for the maintenance of quiescence of the hepatic stellate cells (HSCs), liver-resident mesenchymal stem cells, the activation of which results in liver fibrosis. This gene was not present in human ES cells. ERas was found to be activated in a significant population of human gastric cancer, where ERAS may play a crucial role in gastric cancer cell survival and metastases to liver via down-regulation of E-cadherin. ERas gene has been found to be expressed both in ES cells and adult tissues of cynomolgus monkey. Cynomolgus ERAS did not promote cell proliferation or induce tumor formation. ERAS was also detected in normal and neoplastic urothelium of the urinary bladder in cattle, where bovine ERAS formed a constitutive complex with platelet derived growth factor � receptor (PDGF�R) resulting in the activation of AKT signaling. Here, molecular and morphological findings of ERAS in the full term placenta of pregnant cows have been investigated for the first time. ERAS was studied by reverse transcriptase PCR (RT-PCR). Alignment of the sequence detects a 100% identity with all transcript variant bovine ERas mRNAs, present in the GenBank database (http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov). Furthermore, ERAS was detected by Western blot and investigated by real time PCR that revealed an amount of ERAS more than ERAS found in normal bovine urothelium but less than ERAS present in the liver. Immunohistochemical examination revealed the presence of ERAS protein both at the level of plasma membrane and in cytoplasm of epithelial cells lining caruncular crypts and in trophoblasts of villi. An evident ERAS immunoreactivity was also seen throughout the chorionic and uterine gland epithelium. Although this is not a functional study and further investigations will be warranted, it is conceivable that ERAS may have pleiotropic effects in the placenta, some of which, like normal urothelial cells, might lead to activation of AKT pathway. We speculate that ERAS may play a key role in cellular processes such as cell differentiation and movement. Accordingly, we believe it may be an important factor involved in trophoblast invasiveness via AKT signaling pathway. Therefore, ERas gene is a functional gene which contributes to homeostasis of bovine placenta.","kes, hji",0.0,0,0,2,0.0,,references other data resource
28817627,Analysing researchers' outreach efforts and the association with publication metrics: A case study of Kudos.,"With the growth of scholarly collaboration networks and social communication platforms, members of the scholarly community are experimenting with their approach to disseminating research outputs, in an effort to increase their audience and outreach. However, from a researcher's point of view, it is difficult to determine whether efforts to make work more visible are worthwhile (in terms of the association with publication metrics) and within that, difficult to assess which platform or network is most effective for sharing work and connecting to a wider audience. We undertook a case study of Kudos (https://www.growkudos.com), a web-based service that claims to help researchers increase the outreach of their publications, to examine the most effective tools for sharing publications online, and to investigate which actions are associated with improved metrics. We extracted a dataset from Kudos of 830,565 unique publications claimed by authors, for which 20,775 had actions taken to explain or share via Kudos, and for 4,867 of these full text download data from publishers was available. Findings show that researchers are most likely to share their work on Facebook, but links shared on Twitter are more likely to be clicked on. A Mann-Whitney U test revealed that a treatment group (publications having actions in Kudos) had a significantly higher median average of 149 full text downloads (23.1% more) per publication as compared to a control group (having no actions in Kudos) with a median average of 121 full text downloads per publication. These findings suggest that performing actions on publications, such as sharing, explaining, or enriching, could help to increase the number of full text downloads of a publication.","kes, hji",0.0,0,0,2,0.0,,not about the resource
28880980,Progressive Tinnitus Management Level 3 Skills Education: A 5-Year Clinical Retrospective.,"<h4>Purpose</h4>The primary purpose of this study was to determine whether progressive tinnitus management Level 3 skills education workshops conducted at the Bay Pines and Boston Veterans Affairs hospitals result in consistent use of the presented tinnitus management strategies by patients 1-5 years after completing the workshops.<h4>Method</h4>In fiscal year (FY) 2015, the tinnitus workshop follow-up form was mailed to all veterans who completed the Level 3 workshops between FY 2010 and FY 2014. Data were compiled to determine which, if any, of the skills taught in the workshops were being used 1-5 years after completion of the workshops and the impact on quality-of-life indicators.<h4>Results</h4>All self-management skills were being utilized up to 5 years postcompletion; therapeutic sound was utilized the most. The majority of patients reported an improved ability to manage reactions to tinnitus and improved quality-of-life indicators. Over 90% of patients from both sites recommended the program to others with tinnitus.<h4>Conclusion</h4>The self-management skills taught in the progressive tinnitus management Level 3 workshops are sustained over time even when limited resources prevent the full complement of workshops or the involvement of mental health services. The workshops can also be successfully implemented through remote delivery via videoconferencing (telehealth).<h4>Supplemental materials</h4>https://doi.org/10.23641/asha.5370883.","kes, hji",0.0,0,0,2,0.0,,
28886603,Review of Epidemiological Studies of Drinking-Water Turbidity in Relation to Acute Gastrointestinal Illness.,"<h4>Background</h4>Turbidity has been used as an indicator of microbiological contamination of drinking water in time-series studies attempting to discern the presence of waterborne gastrointestinal illness; however, the utility of turbidity as a proxy exposure measure has been questioned.<h4>Objectives</h4>We conducted a review of epidemiological studies of the association between turbidity of drinking-water supplies and incidence of acute gastrointestinal illness (AGI), including a synthesis of the overall weight of evidence. Our goal was to evaluate the potential for causal inference from the studies.<h4>Methods</h4>We identified 14 studies on the topic (distinct by region, time period and/or population). We evaluated each study with regard to modeling approaches, potential biases, and the strength of evidence. We also considered consistencies and differences in the collective results.<h4>Discussion</h4>Positive associations between drinking-water turbidity and AGI incidence were found in different cities and time periods, and with both unfiltered and filtered supplies. There was some evidence for a stronger association at higher turbidity levels. The studies appeared to adequately adjust for confounding. There was fair consistency in the notable lags between turbidity measurement and AGI identification, which fell between 6 and 10 d in many studies.<h4>Conclusions</h4>The observed associations suggest a detectable incidence of waterborne AGI from drinking water in the systems and time periods studied. However, some discrepant results indicate that the association may be context specific. Combining turbidity with seasonal and climatic factors, additional water quality measures, and treatment data may enhance predictive modeling in future studies. https://doi.org/10.1289/EHP1090.","kes, hji",0.0,0,0,2,0.0,,
28918286,Identifying combinatorial biomarkers by association rule mining in the CAMD Alzheimer's database.,"The concept of combinatorial biomarkers was conceived when it was noticed that simple biomarkers are often inadequate for recognizing and characterizing complex diseases. Here we present an algorithmic search method for complex biomarkers which may predict or indicate Alzheimer's disease (AD) and other kinds of dementia. We show that our method is universal since it can describe any Boolean function for biomarker discovery. We applied data mining techniques that are capable to uncover implication-like logical schemes with detailed quality scoring. The new SCARF program was applied for the Tucson, Arizona based Critical Path Institute's CAMD database, containing laboratory and cognitive test data for 5821 patients from the placebo arm of clinical trials of large pharmaceutical companies, and consequently, the data is much more reliable than numerous other databases for dementia. The results of our study on this larger than 5800-patient cohort suggest beneficial effects of high B12 vitamin level, negative effects of high sodium levels or high AST (aspartate aminotransferase) liver enzyme levels to cognition. As an example for a more complex and quite surprising rule: Low or normal blood glucose level with either low cholesterol or high serum sodium would also increase the probability of bad cognition with a 3.7 multiplier.

We have investigated the in vivo pharmacology of a novel buprenorphine analogue, BU10119, for the first time.<h4>Experimental approach</h4>To determine the opioid pharmacology of BU10119 (0.3-3�mg�kg<sup>-1</sup> , i.p.) in vivo, the warm-water tail-withdrawal assay was applied in adult male CD1 mice. A range of behavioural paradigms was used to investigate the locomotor effects, rewarding properties and antidepressant or anxiolytic potential of BU10119. Additional groups of mice were exposed to a single (1�נ2�h) or repeated restraint stress (3� daily 2�h) to determine the ability of BU10119 to block stress-induced analgesia.<h4>Key results</h4>BU10119 alone was without any antinociceptive activity. BU10119 (1�mg�kg<sup>-1</sup> ) was able to block U50,488, buprenorphine and morphine-induced antinociception. The <U+03BA> antagonist effects of BU10119 in the tail-withdrawal assay reversed between 24 and 48�h. BU10119 was without significant locomotor or rewarding effects. BU10119 (1�mg�kg<sup>-1</sup> ) significantly reduced the latency to feed in the novelty-induced hypophagia task and reduced immobility time in the forced swim test, compared to saline-treated animals. There were no significant effects of BU10119 in either the elevated plus maze or the light-dark box. Both acute and repeated restraint stress-induced analgesia were blocked by pretreatment with BU10119 (1�mg�kg<sup>-1</sup> ). Parallel stress-induced increases in plasma corticosterone were not affected.<h4>Conclusions and implications</h4>BU10119 is a mixed <U+03BA>/� receptor antagonist with relatively short-duration <U+03BA> antagonist activity. Based on these preclinical data, BU10119 has therapeutic potential for the treatment of depression and other stress-induced conditions.<h4>Linked articles</h4>This article is part of a themed section on Emerging Areas of Opioid Pharmacology.

28985876,The readability of psychosocial wellness patient resources: improving surgical outcomes.,"<h4>Background</h4>Patient education is increasingly accessed with online resources and is essential for patient satisfaction and clinical outcomes. The average American adult reads at a seventh grade level, and the National Institute of Health (NIH) and the American Medical Association (AMA) recommend that information be written at a sixth-grade reading level. Health literacy plays an important role in the disease course and outcomes of all patients, including those with depression and likely other psychiatric disorders, although this is an area in need of further study. The purpose of this study was to collect and analyze written, online mental health resources on the Veterans Health Administration (VA) website, and other websites, using readability assessment instruments.<h4>Methods</h4>An internet search was performed to identify written patient education information regarding mental health from the VA (the VA Mental Health Website) and top-rated psychiatric hospitals. Seven mental health topics were included in the analysis: generalized anxiety disorder, bipolar, major depressive disorder, posttraumatic stress disorder, schizophrenia, substance abuse, and suicide. Readability analyses were performed using the Gunning Fog Index, the Flesch-Kincaid Grade Level, the Coleman-Liau Index, the SMOG Readability Formula, and the Automated Readability Index. These scores were then combined into a Readability Consensus score. A two-tailed t-test was used to compare the mean values, and statistical significance was set at P�<�0.05.<h4>Results</h4>Twelve of the best hospitals for psychiatry 2016-2017 were identified. Nine had educational material. Six of the nine cited the same resource, The StayWell Company, LLC (StayWell Company, LLC; Yardley, PA), for at least one of the mental health topics analyzed. The VA mental health website (http://www.mentalhealth.va.gov) had a significantly higher readability consensus than six of the top psychiatric hospitals (P�<�0.05, P�=�0.0067, P�=�0.019, P�=�0.041, P�=�0.0093, P�=�0.0054, and P�=�0.0093). The overall average readability consensus for mental health information on all websites analyzed was 9.52.<h4>Conclusions</h4>Online resources for mental health disorders are more complex than recommended by the NIH and AMA. Efforts to improve readability of mental health and psychosocial wellness resources could benefit patient understanding and outcomes, especially in patients with lower literacy. Surgical outcomes are correlated with patient mental health and psychosocial wellness and thus can be improved with more appropriate levels of readability of psychosocial wellness resources.","kes, hji",0.0,0,0,2,0.0,,

29028266,CircPro: an integrated tool for the identification of circRNAs with protein-coding potential.,"<h4>Summary</h4>Circular RNAs (circRNAs), a novel class of endogenous RNAs, are widespread in eukaryotic cells. Emerging roles in diverse biological processes suggest that circRNA is a promising key player in RNA world. Most circRNAs are generated through back-splicing of pre-mRNAs, forming a covalently closed loop structure with no 5' caps or 3' polyadenylated tails. In addition, most circRNAs were not associated with translating ribosomes, therefore, circRNAs were deemed to be noncoding. However, the latest research findings revealed that some circRNAs could generate proteins in vivo, which expands the landscape of transcriptome and proteome. To gain insights into the new area of circRNA translation, we introduce an integrated tool capable of detecting circRNAs with protein-coding potential from high-throughput sequencing data.<h4>Availability and implementation</h4>CircPro is available at http://bis.zju.edu.cn/CircPro.<h4>Contact</h4>mchen@zju.edu.cn.<h4>Supplementary information</h4>Supplementary data are available at Bioinformatics online.","kes, hji",0.0,0,0,2,0.0,,

29149877,Key bottlenecks to the provision of safe obstetric anaesthesia in low- income countries; a cross-sectional survey of 64 hospitals in Uganda.,"<h4>Background</h4>Despite recent advances in surgery and anaesthesia which significantly improve safety, many health facilities in low-and middle-income countries (LMICs) remain chronically under-resourced with inability to cope effectively with serious obstetric complications (Knight et al., PLoS One 8:e63846, 2013). As a result many of these countries still have unacceptably high maternal and neonatal mortality rates. Recent data at the national referral hospitals in East Africa reported that none of the national referral hospitals met the World Federation of Societies of Anesthesiologists (WFSA) international standards required to provide safe obstetric anaesthesia (Epiu I: Challenges of Anesthesia in Low-and Middle-Income Countries. WFSA; 2014 http://wfsa.newsweaver.com/Newsletter/p8c8ta4ri7a1wsacct9y3u?a=2&p=47730565&t=27996496 ). In spite of this evidence, factors contributing to maternal mortality related to anaesthesia in LMICs and the magnitude of these issues have not been comprehensively studied. We therefore set out to assess regional referral, district, private for profit and private not-for profit hospitals in Uganda.<h4>Methods</h4>We conducted a cross-sectional survey at 64 government and private hospitals in Uganda using pre-set questionnaires to the anaesthetists and hospital directors. Access to the minimum requirements for safe obstetric anaesthesia according to WFSA guidelines were also checked using a checklist for operating and recovery rooms.<h4>Results</h4>Response rate was 100% following personal interviews of anaesthetists, and hospital directors. Only 3 of the 64 (5%) of the hospitals had all requirements available to meet the WFSA International guidelines for safe anaesthesia. Additionally, 54/64 (84%) did not have a trained physician anaesthetist and 5/64 (8%) had no trained providers for anaesthesia at all. Frequent shortages of drugs were reported for regional/neuroaxial anaesthesia, and other essential drugs were often lacking such as antacids and antihypertensives. We noted that many of the anaesthesia machines present were obsolete models without functional safety alarms and/or mechanical ventilators. Continuous ECG was only available in 3/64 (5%) of hospitals.<h4>Conclusion</h4>We conclude that there is a significant lack of essential equipment for the delivery of safe anaesthesia across this region. This is compounded by the shortage of trained providers and inadequate supervision. It is therefore essential to strengthen anaesthesia services by addressing these specific deficiencies. This will include improved training of associate clinicians, training more physician anaesthetists and providing the basic equipment required to provide safe and effective care. These services are key components of comprehensive emergency obstetric care and anaesthetists are crucial in managing critically ill mothers and ensuring good surgical outcomes.","kes, hji",0.0,0,0,2,0.0,,

In the present study, we aimed to analyse the effects of polyphenolic extracts from five types of Arctic berries in a model of diet-induced obesity.<h4>Methods</h4>Male C57BL/6�J mice were fed a high-fat/high-sucrose (HFHS) diet and orally treated with extracts of bog blueberry (BBE), cloudberry (CLE), crowberry (CRE), alpine bearberry (ABE), lingonberry (LGE) or vehicle (HFHS) for 8�weeks. An additional group of standard-chow-fed, vehicle-treated mice was included as a reference control for diet-induced obesity. OGTTs and insulin tolerance tests were conducted, and both plasma insulin and C-peptide were assessed throughout the OGTT. Quantitative PCR, western blot analysis and ELISAs were used to assess enterohepatic immunometabolic features. Faecal DNA was extracted and 16S rRNA gene-based analysis was used to profile the gut microbiota.<h4>Results</h4>Treatment with CLE, ABE and LGE, but not with BBE or CRE, prevented both fasting hyperinsulinaemia (mean � SEM [pmol/l]: chow 67.2 � 12.3, HFHS 153.9 � 19.3, BBE 114.4 � 14.3, CLE 82.5 � 13.0, CRE 152.3 � 24.4, ABE 90.6 � 18.0, LGE 95.4 � 10.5) and postprandial hyperinsulinaemia (mean � SEM AUC [pmol/l � min]: chow 14.3 � 1.4, HFHS 31.4 � 3.1, BBE 27.2 � 4.0, CLE 17.7 � 2.2, CRE 32.6 � 6.3, ABE 22.7 � 18.0, LGE 23.9 � 2.5). None of the berry extracts affected C-peptide levels or body weight gain. Levels of hepatic serine phosphorylated Akt were 1.6-, 1.5- and 1.2-fold higher with CLE, ABE and LGE treatment, respectively, and hepatic carcinoembryonic antigen-related cell adhesion molecule (CEACAM)-1 tyrosine phosphorylation was 0.6-, 0.7- and 0.9-fold increased in these mice vs vehicle-treated, HFHS-fed mice. These changes were associated with reduced liver triacylglycerol deposition, lower circulating endotoxins, alleviated hepatic and intestinal inflammation, and major gut microbial alterations (e.g. bloom of Akkermansia muciniphila, Turicibacter and Oscillibacter) in CLE-, ABE- and LGE-treated mice.<h4>Conclusions/interpretation</h4>Our findings reveal novel mechanisms by which polyphenolic extracts from ABE, LGE and especially CLE target the gut-liver axis to protect diet-induced obese mice against metabolic endotoxaemia, insulin resistance and hepatic steatosis, which importantly improves hepatic insulin clearance. These results support the potential benefits of these Arctic berries and their integration into health programmes to help attenuate obesity-related chronic inflammation and metabolic disorders.<h4>Data availability</h4>All raw sequences have been deposited in the public European Nucleotide Archive server under accession number PRJEB19783 ( https://www.ebi.ac.uk/ena/data/view/PRJEB19783 ).","kes, hji",0.0,0,0,2,0.0,,deposited data

RECOMMENDATION:There is insufficient evidence to support the superiority of either the middle fossa (MF) or the retrosigmoid (RS) approach for complete VS resection and FN preservation when serviceable hearing is present. QUESTION 2:Which surgical approach (RS or translabyrinthine [TL]) for VS is best for complete resection and FN preservation when serviceable hearing is not present? RECOMMENDATION:There is insufficient evidence to support the superiority of either the RS or the TL approach for complete VS resection and FN preservation when serviceable hearing is not present. QUESTION 3:Does VS size matter for facial and vestibulocochlear nerve preservation with surgical resection? RECOMMENDATION:Level 3: Patients with larger VS tumor size should be counseled about the greater than average risk of loss of serviceable hearing. QUESTION 4:Should small intracanalicular tumors (<1.5 cm) be surgically resected? RECOMMENDATION:There are insufficient data to support a firm recommendation that surgery be the primary treatment for this subclass of VSs. QUESTION 5:Is hearing preservation routinely possible with VS surgical resection when serviceable hearing is present? RECOMMENDATION:Level 3: Hearing preservation surgery via the MF or the RS approach may be attempted in patients with small tumor size (<1.5 cm) and good preoperative hearing. QUESTION 6:When should surgical resection be the initial treatment in patients with neurofibromatosis type 2 (NF2)? RECOMMENDATION:There is insufficient evidence that surgical resection should be the initial treatment in patients with NF2. QUESTION 7:Does a multidisciplinary team, consisting of neurosurgery and neurotology, provides the best outcomes of complete resection and facial/vestibulocochlear nerve preservation for patients undergoing resection of VSs? RECOMMENDATION:There is insufficient evidence to support stating that a multidisciplinary team, usually consisting of a neurosurgeon and a neurotologist, provides superior outcomes compared to either subspecialist working alone. QUESTION 8:Does a subtotal surgical resection of a VS followed by stereotactic radiosurgery (SRS) to the residual tumor provide comparable hearing and FN preservation to patients who undergo a complete surgical resection? RECOMMENDATION:There is insufficient evidence to support subtotal resection (STR) followed by SRS provides comparable hearing and FN preservation to patients who undergo a complete surgical resection. QUESTION 9:Does surgical resection of VS treat preoperative balance problems more effectively than SRS? RECOMMENDATION:There is insufficient evidence to support either surgical resection or SRS for treatment of preoperative balance problems. QUESTION 10:Does surgical resection of VS treat preoperative trigeminal neuralgia more effectively than SRS? RECOMMENDATION:Level 3: Surgical resection of VSs may be used to better relieve symptoms of trigeminal neuralgia than SRS. QUESTION 11:Is surgical resection of VSs more difficult (associated with higher facial neuropathies and STR rates) after initial treatment with SRS? RECOMMENDATION:Level 3: If microsurgical resection is necessary after SRS, it is recommended that patients be counseled that there is an increased likelihood of a STR and decreased FN function.

29512488,S2P: A software tool to quickly carry out reproducible biomedical research projects involving 2D-gel and MALDI-TOF MS protein data.,"<h4>Background and objective</h4>2D-gel electrophoresis is widely used in combination with MALDI-TOF mass spectrometry in order to analyze the proteome of biological samples. For instance, it can be used to discover proteins that are differentially expressed between two groups (e.g. two disease conditions, case vs. control, etc.) thus obtaining a set of potential biomarkers. This procedure requires a great deal of data processing in order to prepare data for analysis or to merge and integrate data from different sources. This kind of work is usually done manually (e.g. copying and pasting data into spreadsheet files), which is highly time consuming and distracts the researcher from other important, core tasks. Moreover, engaging in a repetitive process in a non-automated, handling-based manner is prone to error, thus threatening reliability and reproducibility. The objective of this paper is to present S2P, an open source software to overcome these drawbacks.<h4>Methods</h4>S2P is implemented in Java on top of the AIBench framework, and relies on well-established open source libraries to accomplish different tasks.<h4>Results</h4>S2P is an AIBench based desktop multiplatform application, specifically aimed to process 2D-gel and MALDI-mass spectrometry protein identification-based data in a computer-aided, reproducible manner. Different case studies are presented in order to show the usefulness of S2P.<h4>Conclusions</h4>S2P is open source and free to all users at http://www.sing-group.org/s2p.

Additionally, we determined sequence variations associated with antimicrobial resistance phenotypes in single isolates expressing carbapenem and colistin resistance, respectively. For rapid detection of the major <i>K. pneumoniae</i> outbreak clone (ST15), a selective triplex PCR was deduced from WGS data of the major outbreak strain and <i>K. pneumoniae</i> genome data deposited in central databases. Moreover, we introduce two novel open-source applications supporting reference genome selection (<i>refRank</i>; https://gitlab.com/s.fuchs/refRank) and alignment-based SNP-filtering (<i>SNPfilter</i>; https://gitlab.com/s.fuchs/snpfilter) in NGS analyses.","kes, hji",0.0,0,0,2,0.0,,
29530061,Stearoyl-CoA desaturase-1 promotes colorectal cancer metastasis in response to glucose by suppressing PTEN.,"BACKGROUND:Diabetic patients have a higher risk factor for colorectal cancer (CRC) metastasis. Stearoyl-CoA desaturase 1 (SCD1), the main enzyme responsible for producing monounsaturated fatty acids(MUFA) from saturated fatty acids, is frequently deregulated in both diabetes and CRC. The function and mechanism of SCD1 in metastasis of CRC and its relevance to glucose remains largely unknown. METHODS:SCD1 expression levels were analyzed in human CRC tissues and the Cancer Browser database ( https://genome-cancer.ucsc.edu/ ). CRC cell lines stably transfected with SCD1 shRNAs or vector were established to investigate the role of SCD1 in modulating migration and invasion of CRC cells. A glucose concentration gradient was set to investigate regulation of SCD1 in CRC relevant to diabetic conditions. RESULTS:The clinical data analysis showed high expression of SCD1 in CRC tissues with a negative correlation with the prognosis of CRC. In vitro experiments revealed that SCD1 increased CRC progression through promoting epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT). Lipidomic analysis demonstrated that SCD1 increased MUFA levels and MUFA administration could rescue migration and invasion defect of CRC cells induced by SCD1 knockdown. Furthermore, SCD1-mediated progression of CRC was promoted by carbohydrate response-element binding protein (ChREBP) in response to high glucose. Mechanistically, hyperglycemia-SCD1-MUFA induced CRC cell migration and invasion by regulating PTEN. CONCLUSIONS:Our findings show that SCD1 promotes metastasis of CRC cells through MUFA production and suppressing PTEN in response to glucose, which may be a novel mechanism for diabetes-induced CRC metastasis.","kes, hji",0.0,0,0,2,0.0,,
29572201,"Investigating the Impact of Hearing Aid Use and Auditory Training on Cognition, Depressive Symptoms, and Social Interaction in Adults With Hearing Loss: Protocol for a Crossover Trial.","BACKGROUND:Sensorineural hearing loss is the most common sensory deficit among older adults. Some of the psychosocial consequences of this condition include difficulty in understanding speech, depression, and social isolation. Studies have shown that older adults with hearing loss show some age-related cognitive decline. Hearing aids have been proven as successful interventions to alleviate sensorineural hearing loss. In addition to hearing aid use, the positive effects of auditory training-formal listening activities designed to optimize speech perception-are now being documented among adults with hearing loss who use hearing aids, especially new hearing aid users. Auditory training has also been shown to produce prolonged cognitive performance improvements. However, there is still little evidence to support the benefits of simultaneous hearing aid use and individualized face-to-face auditory training on cognitive performance in adults with hearing loss. OBJECTIVE:This study will investigate whether using hearing aids for the first time will improve the impact of individualized face-to-face auditory training on cognition, depression, and social interaction for adults with sensorineural hearing loss. The rationale for this study is based on the hypothesis that, in adults with sensorineural hearing loss, using hearing aids for the first time in combination with individualized face-to-face auditory training will be more effective for improving cognition, depressive symptoms, and social interaction rather than auditory training on its own. METHODS:This is a crossover trial targeting 40 men and women between 50 and 90 years of age with either mild or moderate symmetric sensorineural hearing loss. Consented, willing participants will be recruited from either an independent living accommodation or via a community database to undergo a 6-month intensive face-to-face auditory training program (active control). Participants will be assigned in random order to receive hearing aid (intervention) for either the first 3 or last 3 months of the 6-month auditory training program. Each participant will be tested at baseline, 3, and 6 months using a neuropsychological battery of computer-based cognitive assessments, together with a depression symptom instrument and a social interaction measure. The primary outcome will be cognitive performance with regard to spatial working memory. Secondary outcome measures include other cognition performance measures, depressive symptoms, social interaction, and hearing satisfaction. RESULTS:Data analysis is currently under way and the first results are expected to be submitted for publication in June 2018. CONCLUSIONS:Results from the study will inform strategies for aural rehabilitation, hearing aid delivery, and future hearing loss intervention trials.

29703719,Sialic Acid Blockade Suppresses Tumor Growth by Enhancing T-cell-Mediated Tumor Immunity.,"Sialic acid sugars on the surface of cancer cells have emerged as potent immune modulators that contribute to the immunosuppressive microenvironment and tumor immune evasion. However, the mechanisms by which these sugars modulate antitumor immunity as well as therapeutic strategies directed against them are limited. Here we report that intratumoral injections with a sialic acid mimetic Ac<sub>5</sub>3F<sub>ax</sub>Neu5Ac block tumor sialic acid expression <i>in vivo</i> and suppress tumor growth in multiple tumor models. Sialic acid blockade had a major impact on the immune cell composition of the tumor, enhancing tumor-infiltrating natural killer cell and CD8<sup>+</sup> T-cell numbers while reducing regulatory T-cell and myeloid regulatory cell numbers. Sialic acid blockade enhanced cytotoxic CD8<sup>+</sup> T-cell-mediated killing of tumor cells in part by facilitating antigen-specific T-cell-tumor cell clustering. Sialic acid blockade also synergized with adoptive transfer of tumor-specific CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells <i>in vivo</i> and enhanced CpG immune adjuvant therapy by increasing dendritic cell activation and subsequent CD8<sup>+</sup> T-cell responses. Collectively, these data emphasize the crucial role of sialic acids in tumor immune evasion and provide proof of concept that sialic acid blockade creates an immune-permissive tumor microenvironment for CD8<sup>+</sup> T-cell-mediated tumor immunity, either as single treatment or in combination with other immune-based intervention strategies.<b>Significance:</b> Sialic acid sugars function as important modulators of the immunosuppressive tumor microenvironment that limit potent antitumor immunity.<b>Graphical Abstract:</b> http://cancerres.aacrjournals.org/content/canres/78/13/3574/F1.large.jpg <i>Cancer Res; 78(13); 3574-88. �2018 AACR</i>.","kes, hji",0.0,0,0,2,0.0,,

Walkable neighborhoods have been associated with physical activity, but more rigorous analytical approaches are needed.<h4>Objectives</h4>We used longitudinal data from adult residents of Brisbane, Australia (40-65 years of age at baseline) to estimate effects of changes in neighborhood characteristics over a 6-y period on the likelihood of walking for transport.<h4>Methods</h4>Analyses included 2,789-9,747 How Areas Influence Health and Activity (HABITAT) cohort participants from 200 neighborhoods at baseline (2007) who completed up to three follow-up questionnaires (through 2013). Principal components analysis was used to derive a proxy measure of walkability preference. Environmental predictors were changes in street connectivity, residential density, and land use mix within a one-kilometer network buffer. Associations with any walking and minutes of walking were estimated using logistic and linear regression, including random effects models adjusted for time-varying confounders and a measure of walkability preference, and fixed effects models of changes in individuals to eliminate confounding by time-invariant characteristics.<h4>Results</h4>Any walking for transport (vs. none) was increased in association with an increase in street connectivity (+10 intersections, fixed effects OR=1.19; 95% confidence interval (CI): 1.07, 1.32), residential density (+5 dwellings/hectare, OR=1.10; 95% CI: 1.05, 1.15), and land-use mix (10% increase, OR=1.12; 95% CI: 1.00, 1.26). Associations with minutes of walking were positive based on random effects models, but null for fixed effects models. The association between land-use mix and any walking appeared to be limited to participants in the highest tertile of increased street connectivity (fixed effects OR=1.17; 95% CI: 0.99, 1.35 for a 1-unit increase in land-use mix; interaction <i>p</i>-value=0.05).<h4>Conclusions</h4>Increases in street connectivity, residential density, and land-use heterogeneity were associated with walking for transport among middle-age residents of Brisbane, Australia. https://doi.org/10.1289/EHP2080.","kes, hji",0.0,0,0,2,0.0,,

We analyzed mRNA expression level of CD177 and clinical follow-up survey of PDAC to estimate overall survival (OS) from Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) dataset (GSE21501, containing samples from 102 PDAC patients) by R2 platform (http://r2.amc.nl). We also analyzed correlated genes of CD177 by Gene Ontology (GO) and Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) analysis to predict the potential relationship between neutrophils and prognosis of PDAC. We then performed hematoxylin and eosin (H&E) staining and immunohistochemical staining of surgical specimens to verify infiltration of neutrophils in PDAC tissues. After analyzing mRNA expression data and clinical follow-up survey provided in the GEO dataset (GSE21501, containing samples from 102 PDAC patients) and clinicopathological data of 23 PDAC patients, we demonstrated that CD177 was correlated with poor prognosis. The univariate Kaplan-Meier survival analysis revealed that OS was inversely associated with increased expression of CD177 (P�=�0.012). Expression of phosphodiesterase (PDE)4D was positively related to CD177 in gene correlation analysis (R�=�0.413, P�<�0.001) by R2 platform. H&E staining and immunohistochemistry of CD177 in 23 PDAC surgical samples showed accumulation of neutrophils in the stroma and blood vessels around the cancer cells. In addition, immunohistochemical staining showed that CD177 was highly expressed in the stroma and blood vessels around tumor tissues of PDAC, which was similar to H&E staining. Expression of CD177 can be used to represent infiltration of neutrophils, which may have potential prognostic value in PDAC.","kes, hji",0.0,0,0,2,0.0,,
29743730,Evaluating soil moisture retrievals from ESA's SMOS and NASA's SMAP brightness temperature datasets.,"Two satellites are currently monitoring surface soil moisture (SM) using L-band observations: SMOS (Soil Moisture and Ocean Salinity), a joint ESA (European Space Agency), CNES (Centre national d'�tudes spatiales), and CDTI (the Spanish government agency with responsibility for space) satellite launched on November 2, 2009 and SMAP (Soil Moisture Active Passive), a National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) satellite successfully launched in January 2015. In this study, we used a multilinear regression approach to retrieve SM from SMAP data to create a global dataset of SM, which is consistent with SM data retrieved from SMOS. This was achieved by calibrating coefficients of the regression model using the CATDS (Centre Aval de Traitement des Donn�es) SMOS Level 3 SM and the horizontally and vertically polarized brightness temperatures (TB) at 40� incidence angle, over the 2013 - 2014 period. Next, this model was applied to SMAP L3 TB data from Apr 2015 to Jul 2016. The retrieved SM from SMAP (referred to here as SMAP_Reg) was compared to: (i) the operational SMAP L3 SM (SMAP_SCA), retrieved using the baseline Single Channel retrieval Algorithm (SCA); and (ii) the operational SMOSL3 SM, derived from the multiangular inversion of the L-MEB model (L-MEB algorithm) (SMOSL3). This inter-comparison was made against <i>in situ</i> soil moisture measurements from more than 400 sites spread over the globe, which are used here as a reference soil moisture dataset. The <i>in situ</i> observations were obtained from the International Soil Moisture Network (ISMN; https://ismn.geo.tuwien.ac.at/) in North of America (PBO_H2O, SCAN, SNOTEL, iRON, and USCRN), in Australia (Oznet), Africa (DAHRA), and in Europe (REMEDHUS, SMOSMANIA, FMI, and RSMN). The agreement was analyzed in terms of four classical statistical criteria: Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE), Bias, Unbiased RMSE (UnbRMSE), and correlation coefficient (R). Results of the comparison of these various products with <i>in situ</i> observations show that the performance of both SMAP products i.e. SMAP_SCA and SMAP_Reg is similar and marginally better to that of the SMOSL3 product particularly over the PBO_H2O, SCAN, and USCRN sites. However, SMOSL3 SM was closer to the <i>in situ</i> observations over the DAHRA and Oznet sites. We found that the correlation between all three datasets and <i>in situ</i> measurements is best (R > 0.80) over the Oznet sites and worst (R = 0.58) over the SNOTEL sites for SMAP_SCA and over the DAHRA and SMOSMANIA sites (R= 0.51 and R= 0.45 for SMAP_Reg and SMOSL3, respectively). The Bias values showed that all products are generally dry, except over RSMN, DAHRA, and Oznet (and FMI for SMAP_SCA). Finally, our analysis provided interesting insights that can be useful to improve the consistency between SMAP and SMOS datasets.","kes, hji",0.0,0,0,2,0.0,,

29757429,AlloFinder: a strategy for allosteric modulator discovery and allosterome analyses.,"Allostery tweaks innumerable biological processes and plays a fundamental role in human disease and drug discovery. Exploration of allostery has thus been regarded as a crucial requirement for research on biological mechanisms and the development of novel therapeutics. Here, based on our previously developed allosteric data and methods, we present an interactive platform called AlloFinder that identifies potential endogenous or exogenous allosteric modulators and their involvement in human allosterome. AlloFinder automatically amalgamates allosteric site identification, allosteric screening and allosteric scoring evaluation of modulator-protein complexes to identify allosteric modulators, followed by allosterome mapping analyses of predicted allosteric sites and modulators in human proteome. This web server exhibits prominent performance in the reemergence of allosteric metabolites and exogenous allosteric modulators in known allosteric proteins. Specifically, AlloFinder enables identification of allosteric metabolites for metabolic enzymes and screening of potential allosteric compounds for disease-related targets. Significantly, the feasibility of AlloFinder to discover allosteric modulators was tested in a real case of signal transduction and activation of transcription 3 (STAT3) and validated by mutagenesis and functional experiments. Collectively, AlloFinder is expected to contribute to exploration of the mechanisms of allosteric regulation between metabolites and metabolic enzymes, and to accelerate allosteric drug discovery.

It is the hope that this Guideline becomes a reference on the effective evidence-based surgical management of LUTS/BPH. MATERIALS AND METHODS:The evidence team searched Ovid MEDLINE, the Cochrane Library, and the Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality (AHRQ) database to identify studies indexed between January 2007 and September 2017. When sufficient evidence existed, the body of evidence was assigned a strength rating of A (high), B (moderate), or C (low) for support of Strong, Moderate, or Conditional Recommendations. In the absence of sufficient evidence, additional information is provided as Clinical Principles and Expert Opinions (table 1 in supplementary unabridged guideline, http://jurology.com/). RESULTS:This Guideline provides updated, evidence-based recommendations regarding management of LUTS/BPH utilizing surgery and minimally invasive surgical therapies; additional statements are made regarding diagnostic and pre-operative tests. Clinical statements are made in comparison to what is generally accepted as the gold standard (i.e. transurethral resection of the prostate [TURP]-monopolar and/or bipolar). This guideline is designed to be used in conjunction with the associated treatment algorithm. CONCLUSIONS:The prevalence and the severity of LUTS increases as men age and is an important diagnosis in the healthcare of patients and the welfare of society.

29806693,Neuronal calcineurin transcriptional targets parallel changes observed in Alzheimer disease brain.,"Synaptic dysfunction and loss are core pathological features in Alzheimer disease (AD). In the vicinity of amyloid-� plaques in animal models, synaptic toxicity occurs and is associated with chronic activation of the phosphatase calcineurin (CN). Indeed, pharmacological inhibition of CN blocks amyloid-� synaptotoxicity. We therefore hypothesized that CN-mediated transcriptional changes may contribute to AD neuropathology and tested this by examining the impact of CN over-expression on neuronal gene expression in�vivo. We found dramatic transcriptional down-regulation, especially of synaptic mRNAs, in neurons chronically exposed to CN activation. Importantly, the transcriptional profile parallels the changes in human AD tissue. Bioinformatics analyses suggest that both nuclear factor of activated T cells and numerous microRNAs may all be impacted by CN, and�parallel findings are observed in AD. These data and analyses support the hypothesis that at least part of the synaptic failure characterizing AD may result from aberrant CN activation leading to down-regulation of synaptic genes, potentially via activation of specific transcription factors and expression of repressive microRNAs.<h4>Open practices</h4>Open Science: This manuscript was awarded with the Open Materials Badge.

The identification of protein-coding genes is often based on transcriptome sequencing data, ab-initio or homology-based prediction. Recently, it was demonstrated that intron position conservation improves homology-based gene prediction, and that experimental data improves ab-initio gene prediction.<h4>Results</h4>Here, we present an extension of the gene prediction program GeMoMa that utilizes amino acid sequence conservation, intron position conservation and optionally RNA-seq data for homology-based gene prediction. We show on published benchmark data for plants, animals and fungi that GeMoMa performs better than the gene prediction programs BRAKER1, MAKER2, and CodingQuarry, and purely RNA-seq-based pipelines for transcript identification. In addition, we demonstrate that using multiple reference organisms may help to further improve the performance of GeMoMa. Finally, we apply GeMoMa to four nematode species and to the recently published barley reference genome indicating that current annotations of protein-coding genes may be refined using GeMoMa predictions.<h4>Conclusions</h4>GeMoMa might be of great utility for annotating newly sequenced genomes but also for finding homologs of a specific gene or gene family.

29956198,Prognostic Impact of Extracapsular Lymph Node Invasion on Survival in Non-small-Cell Lung Cancer: A Systematic Review and Meta-analysis.,"The extracapsular tumor extension (ECE) of nodal metastasis is an important prognostic factor in different types of malignancies. However, there is a lack of recent data in patients with non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC). In addition, the TNM staging system does not include ECE status as a prognostic factor. This systematic review and meta-analysis has been conducted to summarize and pool existing data to determine the prognostic role of ECE in patients with lymph node-positive NSCLC. Two authors performed an independent search in PubMed using a predefined keyword list, without language restrictions with publication date since 1990. Prospective or retrospective studies reporting data on prognostic parameters in subjects with NSCLC with positive ECE or with only intracapsular lymph node metastasis were retrieved. Data were summarized using risk ratios (RR) for the survival with 95% confidence intervals (CI). The data was analyzed using Mix 2 (ref: Bax L: MIX 2.0 - Professional software for meta-analysis in Excel. Version 2.015. BiostatXL, 2016. https://www.meta-analysis-made-easy.com ). There 2,105 studies were reviewed. Five studies covering a total of 828 subjects met the inclusion criteria and were included in the meta-analysis. Two hundred and ninety-eight (35.9%) patients were categorized as ECE+, of whom 54 (18.1%) survived at the end of follow-up. In the ECE-negative group, 257 patients (48.4%) survived by the end of follow-up. Thus, ECE status is associated with a significantly decreased survival rate: pooled RR 0.45 (95% CI 0.35-0.59), Q <sub>(4)</sub>�=�4.06, P <sub>value</sub>�=�0.39, and I <sup>2</sup>�=�68.00% (95 CI 0.00-79.55%). In conclusion, ECE has a significant impact on survival in NSCLC patients and should be considered in diagnostic and therapeutic decisions in addition to the current TNM staging. Postoperative radiotherapy may be an option in ECE-positive pN1 NSCLC patients.","kes, hji",0.0,0,0,2,0.0,,

30026590,Adult energy requirements predicted from doubly labeled water.,"<h4>Background</h4>Estimating energy requirements forms an integral part of developing diet and activity interventions. Current estimates often rely on a product of physical activity level (PAL) and a resting metabolic rate (RMR) prediction. PAL estimates, however, typically depend on subjective self-reported activity or a clinician's best guess. Energy-requirement models that do not depend on an input of PAL may provide an attractive alternative.<h4>Methods</h4>Total daily energy expenditure (TEE) measured by doubly labeled water (DLW) and a metabolic chamber from 119 subjects obtained from a database of pre-intervention measurements measured at Pennington Biomedical Research Center were used to develop a metabolic ward and free-living models that predict energy requirements. Graded models, including different combinations of input variables consisting of age, height, weight, waist circumference, body composition, and the resting metabolic rate were developed. The newly developed models were validated and compared to three independent databases.<h4>Results</h4>Sixty-four different linear and nonlinear regression models were developed. The adjusted R<sup>2</sup> for models predicting free-living energy requirements ranged from 0.65 with covariates of age, height, and weight to 0.74 in models that included body composition and RMR. Independent validation R<sup>2</sup> between actual and predicted TEE varied greatly across studies and between genders with higher coefficients of determination, lower bias, slopes closer to 1, and intercepts closer to zero, associated with inclusion of body composition and RMR covariates. The models were programmed into a user-friendly web-based app available at: http://www.pbrc.edu/research-and-faculty/calculators/energy-requirements/ (Video Demo for Reviewers at: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5UKjJeQdODQ ) CONCLUSIONS: Energy-requirement equations that do not require knowledge of activity levels and include all available input variables can provide more accurate baseline estimates. The models are clinically accessible through the web-based application.","kes, hji",0.0,0,0,2,0.0,,

30124903,A case study evaluating the portability of an executable computable phenotype algorithm across multiple institutions and electronic health record environments.,"Electronic health record (EHR) algorithms for defining patient cohorts are commonly shared as free-text descriptions that require human intervention both to interpret and implement. We developed the Phenotype Execution and Modeling Architecture (PhEMA, http://projectphema.org) to author and execute standardized computable phenotype algorithms. With PhEMA, we converted an algorithm for benign prostatic hyperplasia, developed for the electronic Medical Records and Genomics network (eMERGE), into a standards-based computable format. Eight sites (7 within eMERGE) received the computable algorithm, and 6 successfully executed it against local data warehouses and/or i2b2 instances. Blinded random chart review of cases selected by the computable algorithm shows PPV =90%, and 3 out of 5 sites had >90% overlap of selected cases when comparing the computable algorithm to their original eMERGE implementation. This case study demonstrates potential use of PhEMA computable representations to automate phenotyping across different EHR systems, but also highlights some ongoing challenges.","kes, hji",0.0,0,0,2,0.0,,

30161123,Interactive implementations of thermodynamics-based RNA structure and RNA-RNA interaction prediction approaches for example-driven teaching.,"The investigation of RNA-based regulation of cellular processes is becoming an increasingly important part of biological or medical research. For the analysis of this type of data, RNA-related prediction tools are integrated into many pipelines and workflows. In order to correctly apply and tune these programs, the user has to have a precise understanding of their limitations and concepts. Within this manuscript, we provide the mathematical foundations and extract the algorithmic ideas that are core to state-of-the-art RNA structure and RNA-RNA interaction prediction algorithms. To allow the reader to change and adapt the algorithms or to play with different inputs, we provide an open-source web interface to JavaScript implementations and visualizations of each algorithm. The conceptual, teaching-focused presentation enables a high-level survey of the approaches, while providing sufficient details for understanding important concepts. This is boosted by the simple generation and study of examples using the web interface available at http://rna.informatik.uni-freiburg.de/Teaching/. In combination, we provide a valuable resource for teaching, learning, and understanding the discussed prediction tools and thus enable a more informed analysis of RNA-related effects.","kes, hji",0.0,0,0,2,0.0,,

General linear model, scaled subprofile modeling and support vector machines were examined. Among the tested classification methods, support vector machine with Iterative Single Data Algorithm produced the best performance, i.e., sensitivity (0.84) � specificity (0.95), by 10-fold cross-validation. We have applied the same classification algorithm to four different datasets from ADNI, Health Science Centre (Winnipeg, Canada), Dong-A University Hospital (Busan, S. Korea) and Asan Medical Centre (Seoul, S. Korea). Our data analyses confirmed that the support vector machine with Iterative Single Data Algorithm showed the best performance in prediction of future development of AD from the prodromal stage (mild cognitive impairment), and that it was also sensitive to other types of dementia such as Parkinson's Disease Dementia and Dementia with Lewy Bodies, and that perfusion imaging using single photon emission computed tomography may achieve a similar accuracy to that of FDG-PET.","kes, hji",0.0,0,0,2,0.0,,clinical
30200994,TAP: a targeted clinical genomics pipeline for detecting transcript variants using RNA-seq data.,"<h4>Background</h4>RNA-seq is a powerful and cost-effective technology for molecular diagnostics of cancer and other diseases, and it can reach its full potential when coupled with validated clinical-grade informatics tools. Despite recent advances in long-read sequencing, transcriptome assembly of short reads remains a useful and cost-effective methodology for unveiling transcript-level rearrangements and novel isoforms. One of the major concerns for adopting the proven de novo assembly approach for RNA-seq data in clinical settings has been the analysis turnaround time. To address this concern, we have developed a targeted approach to expedite assembly and analysis of RNA-seq data.<h4>Results</h4>Here we present our Targeted Assembly Pipeline (TAP), which consists of four stages: 1) alignment-free gene-level classification of RNA-seq reads using BioBloomTools, 2) de novo assembly of individual targets using Trans-ABySS, 3) alignment of assembled contigs to the reference genome and transcriptome with GMAP and BWA and 4) structural and splicing variant detection using PAVFinder. We show that PAVFinder is a robust gene fusion detection tool when compared to established methods such as Tophat-Fusion and deFuse on simulated data of 448 events. Using the Leucegene acute myeloid leukemia (AML) RNA-seq data and a set of 580 COSMIC target genes, TAP identified a wide range of hallmark molecular anomalies including gene fusions, tandem duplications, insertions and deletions in agreement with published literature results. Moreover, also in this dataset, TAP captured AML-specific splicing variants such as skipped exons and novel splice sites reported in studies elsewhere. Running time of TAP on 100-150 million read pairs and a 580-gene set is one to 2 hours on a 48-core machine.<h4>Conclusions</h4>We demonstrated that TAP is a fast and robust RNA-seq variant detection pipeline that is potentially amenable to clinical applications.

30202060,Terminal exon characterization with TECtool reveals an abundance of cell-specific isoforms.,"Sequencing of RNA 3' ends has uncovered numerous sites that do not correspond to the termination sites of known transcripts. Through their 3' untranslated regions, protein-coding RNAs interact with RNA-binding proteins and microRNAs, which regulate many properties, including RNA stability and subcellular localization. We developed the terminal exon characterization (TEC) tool ( http://tectool.unibas.ch ), which can be used with RNA-sequencing data from any species for which a genome annotation that includes sites of RNA cleavage and polyadenylation is available. We discovered hundreds of previously unknown isoforms and cell-type-specific terminal exons in human cells. Ribosome profiling data revealed that many of these isoforms were translated. By applying TECtool to single-cell sequencing data, we found that the newly identified isoforms were expressed in subpopulations of cells. Thus, TECtool enables the identification of previously unknown isoforms in well-studied cell systems and in rare cell types.","kes, hji",0.0,0,0,2,0.0,,
30239574,A clustering linear combination approach to jointly analyze multiple phenotypes for GWAS.,"<h4>Summary</h4>There is an increasing interest in joint analysis of multiple phenotypes for genome-wide association studies (GWASs) based on the following reasons. First, cohorts usually collect multiple phenotypes and complex diseases are usually measured by multiple correlated intermediate phenotypes. Second, jointly analyzing multiple phenotypes may increase statistical power for detecting genetic variants associated with complex diseases. Third, there is increasing evidence showing that pleiotropy is a widespread phenomenon in complex diseases. In this paper, we develop a clustering linear combination (CLC) method to jointly analyze multiple phenotypes for GWASs. In the CLC method, we first cluster individual statistics into positively correlated clusters and then, combine the individual statistics linearly within each cluster and combine the between-cluster terms in a quadratic form. CLC is not only robust to different signs of the means of individual statistics, but also reduce the degrees of freedom of the test statistic. We also theoretically prove that if we can cluster the individual statistics correctly, CLC is the most powerful test among all tests with certain quadratic forms. Our simulation results show that CLC is either the most powerful test or has similar power to the most powerful test among the tests we compared, and CLC is much more powerful than other tests when effect sizes align with inferred clusters. We also evaluate the performance of CLC through a real case study.<h4>Availability and implementation</h4>R code for implementing our method is available at http://www.math.mtu.edu/~shuzhang/software.html.<h4>Supplementary information</h4>Supplementary data are available at Bioinformatics online.","kes, hji",0.0,0,0,2,0.0,,

Novel surgical strategies, including instrumentation without fusion and percutaneous instrumentation alone, have been considered less invasive and more efficient treatments.<h4>Objective</h4>To review the current literature and determine the role of fusion in instrumented fixation, as well as the role of percutaneous instrumentation, in the treatment of patients with thoracolumbar burst fractures.<h4>Methods</h4>The task force members identified search terms/parameters and a medical librarian implemented the literature search, consistent with the literature search protocol (see Appendix I), using the National Library of Medicine PubMed database and the Cochrane Library for the period from January 1, 1946 to March 31, 2015.<h4>Results</h4>A total of 906 articles were identified and 38 were selected for full-text review. Of these articles, 12 articles met criteria for inclusion in this systematic review.<h4>Conclusion</h4>There is grade A evidence for the omission of fusion in instrumented fixation for thoracolumbar burst fractures. There is grade B evidence that percutaneous instrumentation is as effective as open instrumentation for thoracolumbar burst fractures.<h4>Question</h4>Does the addition of arthrodesis to instrumented fixation improve outcomes in patients with thoracic and lumbar burst fractures?<h4>Recommendation</h4>It is recommended that in the surgical treatment of patients with thoracolumbar burst fractures, surgeons should understand that the addition of arthrodesis to instrumented stabilization has not been shown to impact clinical or radiological outcomes, and adds to increased blood loss and operative time. Strength of Recommendation: Grade A.<h4>Question</h4>How does the use of minimally invasive techniques (including percutaneous instrumentation) affect outcomes in patients undergoing surgery for thoracic and lumbar fractures compared to conventional open techniques?<h4>Recommendation</h4>Stabilization using both open and percutaneous pedicle screws may be considered in the treatment of thoracolumbar burst fractures as the evidence suggests equivalent clinical outcomes.

30302823,Overlapping clustering of gene expression data using penalized weighted normalized cut.,"Clustering has been widely conducted in the analysis of gene expression data. For complex diseases, it has played an important role in identifying unknown functions of genes, serving as the basis of other analysis, and others. A common limitation of most existing clustering approaches is to assume that genes are separated into disjoint clusters. As genes often have multiple functions and thus can belong to more than one functional cluster, the disjoint clustering results can be unsatisfactory. In addition, due to the small sample sizes of genetic profiling studies and other factors, there may not be sufficient evidence to confirm the specific functions of some genes and cluster them definitively into disjoint clusters. In this study, we develop an effective overlapping clustering approach, which takes account into the multiplicity of gene functions and lack of certainty in practical analysis. A penalized weighted normalized cut (PWNCut) criterion is proposed based on the NCut technique and an <mml:math xmlns:mml=""""http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML""""><mml:msub><mml:mi>L</mml:mi> <mml:mn>2</mml:mn></mml:msub> </mml:math> norm constraint. It outperforms multiple competitors in simulation. The analysis of the cancer genome atlas (TCGA) data on breast cancer and cervical cancer leads to biologically sensible findings which differ from those using the alternatives. To facilitate implementation, we develop the function pwncut in the R package NCutYX.","kes, hji",0.0,0,0,2,0.0,,
30367593,On the impact of uncertain gene tree rooting on duplication-transfer-loss reconciliation.,"<h4>Background</h4>Duplication-Transfer-Loss (DTL) reconciliation is a powerful and increasingly popular technique for studying the evolution of microbial gene families. DTL reconciliation requires the use of rooted gene trees to perform the reconciliation with the species tree, and the standard technique for rooting gene trees is to assign a root that results in the minimum reconciliation cost across all rootings of that gene tree. However, even though it is well understood that many gene trees have multiple optimal roots, only a single optimal root is randomly chosen to create the rooted gene tree and perform the reconciliation. This remains an important overlooked and unaddressed problem in DTL reconciliation, leading to incorrect evolutionary inferences. In this work, we perform an in-depth analysis of the impact of uncertain gene tree rooting on the computed DTL reconciliation and provide the first computational tools to quantify and negate the impact of gene tree rooting uncertainty on DTL reconciliation.<h4>Results</h4>Our analysis of a large data set of over 4500 gene families from 100 species shows that a large fraction of gene trees have multiple optimal rootings, that these multiple roots often, but not always, appear closely clustered together in the same region of the gene tree, that many aspects of the reconciliation remain conserved across the multiple rootings, that gene tree error has a profound impact on the prevalence and structure of multiple optimal rootings, and that there are specific interesting patterns in the reconciliation of those gene trees that have multiple optimal roots.<h4>Conclusions</h4>Our results show that unrooted gene trees can be meaningfully reconciled and high-quality evolutionary information can be obtained from them even after accounting for multiple optimal rootings. In addition, the techniques and tools introduced in this paper make it possible to systematically avoid incorrect evolutionary inferences caused by incorrect or uncertain gene tree rooting.

Herein, we provide particle image velocimetry (PIV) measurements of flow in a patient-averaged IVC geometry under idealized conditions typical of those used in the preclinical evaluation of IVC filters.<h4>Methods</h4>Measurements are acquired under rest and exercise flow rate conditions in an optically transparent model fabricated using 3D printing. To ensure that boundary conditions are well-defined and to make follow-on CFD validation studies more convenient, fully-developed flow is provided at the inlets (i.e., the iliac veins) by extending them with straight rigid tubing longer than the estimated entrance lengths. Velocity measurements are then obtained at the downstream end of the tubing to confirm Poiseuille inflow boundary conditions.<h4>Results</h4>Measurements in the infrarenal IVC reveal that flow profiles are blunter in the sagittal plane (minor axis) than in the coronal plane (major axis). Peak in-plane velocity magnitudes are 4.9�cm/s and 27�cm/s under the rest and exercise conditions, respectively. Flow profiles are less parabolic and exhibit more inflection points at the higher flow rate. Bimodal velocity peaks are also observed in the sagittal plane at the elevated flow condition.<h4>Conclusions</h4>The IVC geometry, boundary conditions, and infrarenal velocity measurements are provided for download on a free and publicly accessible repository�at https://doi.org/10.6084/m9.figshare.7198703 . These data will facilitate future CFD validation studies of idealized, in vitro IVC hemodynamics and of similar laminar flows in vascular geometries.","kes, hji",0.0,0,0,2,0.0,,

30467523,gganatogram: An R package for modular visualisation of anatograms and tissues based on ggplot2.,"Displaying data onto anatomical structures is a convenient technique to quickly observe tissue related information. However, drawing tissues is a complex task that requires both expertise in anatomy and the arts. While web based applications exist for displaying gene expression on anatograms, other non-genetic disciplines lack similar tools. Moreover, web based tools often lack the modularity associated with packages in programming languages, such as R. Here I present gganatogram, an R package used to plot modular species anatograms based on a combination of the graphical grammar of ggplot2 and the publicly available anatograms from the Expression Atlas. This combination allows for quick and easy, modular, and reproducible generation of anatograms. Using only one command and a data frame with tissue name, group, colour, and �value, this tool enables the user to visualise specific human and mouse tissues with desired colours, grouped by a variable, or displaying a desired value, such as gene-expression, pharmacokinetics, or bacterial load across selected tissues. gganatogram consists of 5 highly annotated organisms, male/female human/mouse, and a cell anatogram. It further consists of 24 other less annotated organisms from the animal and plant kingdom. I hope that this tool will be useful by the wider community in biological sciences. Community members are welcome to submit additional anatograms, which can be incorporated into the package. A stable version gganatogram has been deposited to neuroconductor, and a development version can be found on� github/jespermaag/gganatogram. An interactive shiny app of gganatogram can be found on� https://jespermaag.shinyapps.io/gganatogram/, which allows for non-R users to create anatograms.","kes, hji",0.0,0,0,2,0.0,,

30476000,Integrate multiple traits to detect novel trait-gene association using GWAS summary data with an adaptive test approach.,"<h4>Motivation</h4>Genetics hold great promise to precision medicine by tailoring treatment to the individual patient based on their genetic profiles. Toward this goal, many large-scale genome-wide association studies (GWAS) have been performed in the last decade to identify genetic variants associated with various traits and diseases. They have successfully identified tens of thousands of disease-related variants. However they have explained only a small proportion of the overall trait heritability for most traits and are of very limited clinical use. This is partly owing to the small effect sizes of most genetic variants, and the common practice of testing association between one trait and one genetic variant at a time in most GWAS, even when multiple related traits are often measured for each individual. Increasing evidence suggests that many genetic variants can influence multiple traits simultaneously, and we can gain more power by testing association of multiple traits simultaneously. It is appealing to develop novel multi-trait association test methods that need only GWAS summary data, since it is generally very hard to access the individual-level GWAS phenotype and genotype data.<h4>Results</h4>Many existing GWAS summary data-based association test methods have relied on ad hoc approach or crude Monte Carlo approximation. In this article, we develop rigorous statistical methods for efficient and powerful multi-trait association test. We develop robust and efficient methods to accurately estimate the marginal trait correlation matrix using only GWAS summary data. We construct the principal component (PC)-based association test from the summary statistics. PC-based test has optimal power when the underlying multi-trait signal can be captured by the first PC, and otherwise it will have suboptimal performance. We develop an adaptive test by optimally weighting the PC-based test and the omnibus chi-square test to achieve robust performance under various scenarios. We develop efficient numerical algorithms to compute the analytical P-values for all the proposed tests without the need of Monte Carlo sampling. We illustrate the utility of proposed methods through application to the GWAS meta-analysis summary data for multiple lipids and glycemic traits. We identify multiple novel loci that were missed by individual trait-based association test.<h4>Availability and implementation</h4>All the proposed methods are implemented in an R package available at http://www.github.com/baolinwu/MTAR. The developed R programs are extremely efficient: it takes less than 2 min to compute the list of genome-wide significant single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) for all proposed multi-trait tests for the lipids GWAS summary data with 2.5 million SNPs on a single Linux desktop.<h4>Supplementary information</h4>Supplementary data are available at Bioinformatics online.","kes, hji",0.0,0,0,2,0.0,,

However, other analyses suggest that AD and brain tumor might be positively correlated. Objective:In the current study, we wished to determine the relationship of AD mortality to malignant brain tumor mortality in US states and counties. Methods:Data and maps of malignant brain tumor mortality and Alzheimer's disease mortality (1999-2016) are from the CDC Wonder tool (https://wonder.cdc.gov/cmf-icd10.html). Data on malignant brain tumor types and their frequencies are from the Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results Program (SEER, https://seer.cancer.gov). Data on the genetics of lower grade glioma are from the TCGA Lower Grade Glioma (LGG) dataset in TCGA (The Cancer Genome Atlas). Results:SEER data indicate that astrocytomas make up 58.2% of malignant brain tumors in patients 65 and older; glioblastoma and anaplastic astrocytoma make up 41.6%. We found a significant positive correlation between AD mortality rate and malignant brain tumor mortality rate 1999-2016 in persons age 65 and older in A) 1,101 US counties, p <  0.001 and B) 50 US states, p <  0.001.

30572878,"Geographical mobility of UK trainee doctors, from family home to first job: a national cohort study.","<h4>Background</h4>The UK faces geographical variation in the recruitment of doctors. Understanding where medical graduates choose to go for training is important because doctors are more likely to consider practicing in areas where they completed postgraduate training. The wider literature also suggests that there is a relationship between origin and background, and where doctors wish to train/work. Thus, the purpose of this paper is to investigate the geographical mobility of UK medical graduates from different socio-economic groups in terms of where they wish to spend their first years of postgraduate training.<h4>Methods</h4>This was an observational study of Foundation Programme (FP) doctors who graduated from 33 UK medical schools between 2012 and 2014. Data was accessed via the UK medical education database (UKMED: https://www.ukmed.ac.uk/ ). Chi-square tests were used to examine the relationships between doctor's sociodemographic characteristics and the dependent variable, average driving time from parental home to foundation school/region. Generalised Linear Mixed Models (GLMM) were used to estimate the effects of those factors in combination against the outcome measure.<h4>Results</h4>The majority of doctors prefer to train at foundation schools that are reasonably close to the family home. Those who attended state-funded schools, from non-white ethnic groups and/or from lower socio-economic groups were significantly more likely to choose foundation schools nearer their parental home. Doctors from disadvantaged backgrounds (as determined by entitlement to free school meals, OR = 1.29, p�= 0.003 and no parental degree, OR = 1.34, p�< 0.001) were associated with higher odds of selecting a foundation schools that were closer to parental home.<h4>Conclusion</h4>The data suggests that recruiting medical students from lower socioeconomic groups and those who originate from under-recruiting areas may be at least part of the solution to filling training posts in these areas. This has obvious implications for the widening access agenda, and equitable distribution of health services.","kes, hji",0.0,0,0,2,0.0,,
30578582,Sex differences in the circulatory responses to an isocapnic cold pressor test.,"<h4>New findings</h4>What is the central question of this study? Do sex differences exist in the cardiorespiratory responses to an isocapnic cold pressor test (CPT)? What is the main finding and its importance? During the CPT, there were no sex differences in the respiratory response; however, females demonstrated a reduced mean arterial pressure and reduced dilatation of the common carotid artery. Given that the CPT is predictive of future cardiovascular events, these data have clinical implications for improving the utility of the CPT to determine cardiovascular health risk. Sex differences should be taken into consideration when conducting and interpreting a CPT.<h4>Abstract</h4>The cold pressor test (CPT) elicits a transient increase in sympathetic nervous activity, minute ventilation ( <mml:math xmlns:mml=""""http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML""""> <mml:msub><mml:mover><mml:mi>V</mml:mi> <mml:mo><U+0307></mml:mo></mml:mover> <mml:mi>E</mml:mi></mml:msub> </mml:math> ), mean arterial pressure (MAP) and common carotid artery (CCA) diameter in healthy individuals. Although the extent of dilatation of the CCA in response to the CPT has been used as a clinical indicator of cardiovascular health status, the potential sex differences have yet to be explored. In response to a CPT, we hypothesized that elevations in <mml:math xmlns:mml=""""http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML""""> <mml:msub><mml:mover><mml:mi>V</mml:mi> <mml:mo><U+0307></mml:mo></mml:mover> <mml:mi>E</mml:mi></mml:msub> </mml:math> and MAP and dilatation of the CCA would be attenuated in females compared with males. In 20 young, healthy participants (10 females), we measured the respiratory, cardiovascular and CCA responses during a CPT, which consisted of a 3�min immersion of the right foot into 0-1 ice water. Blood pressure (via finger photoplethysmography), heart rate (via electrocardiogram) and CCA diameter and velocity (via Duplex ultrasound) were simultaneously recorded immediately before and during the CPT. During the CPT, while controlling end-tidal gases to baseline values, the main findings were as follows: (i) no sex differences were present in absolute or relative changes in <mml:math xmlns:mml=""""http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML""""> <mml:msub><mml:mover><mml:mi>V</mml:mi> <mml:mo><U+0307></mml:mo></mml:mover> <mml:mi>E</mml:mi></mml:msub> </mml:math> (P�=�0.801 and P�=�0.179, respectively); (ii) the relative MAP and CCA diameter response were reduced in females by 51 and 55%, respectively (P�=�0.008 and P�=�0.029�versus males, respectively); and (iii) the relative MAP responses was positively correlated with the dilatation of the CCA in males (r�=�0.42, P�=�0.019), in females (r�=�0.43, P�=�0.019) and in males and females combined (r�=�0.55, P�<�0.001). Given that the CPT is used as a clinical tool to assess cardiovascular health status, sex differences should be considered in future studies.","kes, hji",0.0,0,0,2,0.0,,
30591010,DLAD4U: deriving and prioritizing disease lists from PubMed literature.,"<h4>Background</h4>Due to recent technology advancements, disease related knowledge is growing rapidly. It becomes nontrivial to go through all published literature to identify associations between human diseases and genetic, environmental, and life style factors, disease symptoms, and treatment strategies. Here we report DLAD4U (Disease List Automatically Derived For You), an efficient, accurate and easy-to-use disease search engine based on PubMed literature.<h4>Results</h4>DLAD4U uses the eSearch and eFetch APIs from the National Center for Biotechnology Information (NCBI) to find publications related to a query and to identify diseases from the retrieved publications. The hypergeometric test was used to prioritize identified diseases for displaying to users. DLAD4U accepts any valid queries for PubMed, and the output results include a ranked disease list, information associated with each disease, chronologically-ordered supporting publications, a summary of the run, and links for file export. DLAD4U outperformed other disease search engines in our comparative evaluation using selected genes and drugs as query terms and manually curated data as """"gold standard"""". For 100 genes that are associated with only one disease in the gold standard, the Mean Average Precision (MAP) measure from DLAD4U was 0.77, which clearly outperformed other tools. For 10 genes that are associated with multiple diseases in the gold standard, the mean precision, recall and F-measure scores from DLAD4U were always higher than those from other tools. The superior performance of DLAD4U was further confirmed using 100 drugs as queries, with an MAP of 0.90.<h4>Conclusions</h4>DLAD4U is a new, intuitive disease search engine that takes advantage of existing resources at NCBI to provide computational efficiency and uses statistical analyses to ensure accuracy. DLAD4U is publicly available at http://dlad4u.zhang-lab.org .","kes, hji",0.0,0,0,2,0.0,,
30687361,PolyMorphPredict: A Universal Web-Tool for Rapid Polymorphic Microsatellite Marker Discovery From Whole Genome and Transcriptome Data.,"Microsatellites are ubiquitously distributed, polymorphic repeat sequence valuable for association, selection, population structure and identification. They can be mined by genomic library, probe hybridization and sequencing of selected clones. Such approach has many limitations like biased hybridization and selection of larger repeats. In silico mining of polymorphic markers using data of various genotypes can be rapid and economical. Available tools lack in some or other aspects like: targeted user defined primer generation, polymorphism discovery using multiple sequence, size and number limits of input sequence, no option for primer generation and e-PCR evaluation, transferability, lack of complete automation and user-friendliness. They also lack the provision to evaluate published primers in e-PCR mode to generate additional allelic data using re-sequenced data of various genotypes for judicious utilization of previously generated data. We developed the tool (PolyMorphPredict) using Perl, R, Java and launched at Apache which is available at http://webtom.cabgrid.res.in/polypred/. It mines microsatellite loci and computes primers from genome/transcriptome data of any species. It can perform e-PCR using published primers for polymorphism discovery and across species transferability of microsatellite loci. Present tool has been evaluated using five species of different genome size having 21 genotypes. Though server is equipped with genomic data of three species for test run with gel simulation, but can be used for any species. Further, polymorphism predictability has been validated using in silico and in vitro PCR of four rice genotypes. This tool can accelerate the in silico microsatellite polymorphism discovery in re-sequencing projects of any species of plant and animal for their diversity estimation along with variety/breed identification, population structure, MAS, QTL and gene discovery, traceability, parentage testing, fungal diagnostics and genome finishing.","kes, hji",0.0,0,0,2,0.0,,
30701134,"Prognostic values of GMPS, PR, CD40, and p21 in ovarian cancer.","Early detection and prediction of prognosis and treatment responses are all the keys in improving survival of ovarian cancer patients. This study profiled an ovarian cancer progression model to identify prognostic biomarkers for ovarian cancer patients. Mouse ovarian surface epithelial cells (MOSECs) can undergo spontaneous malignant transformation in vitro cell culture. These were used as a model of ovarian cancer progression for alterations in gene expression and signaling detected using the Illumina HiSeq2000 Next-Generation Sequencing platform and bioinformatical analyses. The differential expression of four selected genes was identified using the gene expression profiling interaction analysis (http://gepia.cancer-pku.cn/) and then associated with survival in ovarian cancer patients using the Cancer Genome Atlas dataset and the online Kaplan-Meier Plotter (http://www.kmplot.com) data. The data showed 263 aberrantly expressed genes, including 182 up-regulated and 81 down-regulated genes between the early and late stages of tumor progression in MOSECs. The bioinformatic data revealed four genes (i.e., guanosine 5'-monophosphate synthase (GMPS), progesterone receptor (PR), CD40, and p21 (cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor 1A)) to play an important role in ovarian cancer progression. Furthermore, the Cancer Genome Atlas dataset validated the differential expression of these four genes, which were associated with prognosis in ovarian cancer patients. In conclusion, this study profiled differentially expressed genes using the ovarian cancer progression model and identified four (i.e., GMPS, PR, CD40, and p21) as prognostic markers for ovarian cancer patients. Future studies of prospective patients could further verify the clinical usefulness of this four-gene signature.","kes, hji",0.0,0,0,2,0.0,,
30708525,First Report of Impatiens Downy Mildew Outbreaks Caused by Plasmopara obducens Throughout the Hawai'ian Islands.,"Downy mildew of impatiens (Impatiens walleriana Hook.f.) was first reported from the continental United States in 2004. In 2011 to 2012, severe and widespread outbreaks were documented across the United States mainland, resulting in considerable economic losses. On May 5, 2013, downy mildew disease symptoms were observed from I. walleriana 'Super Elfin' at a retail nursery in Mililani, on the Hawai'ian island of Oahu. Throughout May and June 2013, additional sightings of the disease were documented from the islands of Oahu, Kauai, Maui, and Hawai'i from nurseries, home gardens, and botanical park and landscape plantings. Symptoms of infected plants initially showed downward leaf curl, followed by a stippled chlorotic appearance on the adaxial leaf surfaces. Abaxial leaf surfaces were covered with a layer of white mycelia. Affected plants exhibited defoliation, flower drop, and stem rot as the disease progressed. Based on morphological and molecular data, the organism was identified as Plasmopara obducens (J. Schr�t.) J. Schr�t. Microscopic observation disclosed coenocytic mycelium and hyaline, thin-walled, tree-like (monopodial branches), straight, 94.0 to 300.0 � 3.2 to 10.8 �m sporangiophores. Ovoid, hyaline sporangia measuring 11.0 to 14.6 � 12.2 to 16.2 (average 13.2 � 14.7) �m were borne on sterigma tips of rigid branchlets (8.0 to 15.0 �m) at right angle to the main axis of the sporangiophores (1,3). Molecular identification of the pathogen was conducted by removing hyphae from the surface of three heavily infected leaves using sterile tweezers, then extracting DNA using the QIAGEN Plant DNA kit (QIAGEN, Gaithersburg, MD). The nuclear rDNA internal transcribed spacer was sequenced from each of the three samples bidirectionally from Illustra EXOStar (GE Healthcare, Piscataway, NJ) purified amplicon generated from primers ITS1-O and LR-0R (4). Resultant sequences (GenBank KF366378 to 80) shared 99 to 100% nucleotide identity with P. obducens accession DQ665666 (4). A voucher specimen (BPI892676) was deposited in the U.S. National Fungus Collections, Beltsville, MD. Pathogenicity tests were performed by spraying 6-week-old impatiens plants (I. walleriana var. Super Elfin) grown singly in 4-inch pots with a suspension of 1 � 10<sup>4</sup> P. obducens sporangia/ml until runoff using a handheld atomizer. Control plants were sprayed with distilled water. The plants were kept in high humidity by covering with black plastic bags for 48 h at 20�C, and then maintained in the greenhouse (night/day temperature of 20/24�C). The first symptoms (downward curling and chlorotic stippling of leaves) and sporulation of the pathogen on under-leaf surfaces of the inoculated plants appeared at 10 days and 21 days after inoculation, respectively. Control plants remained healthy. Morphological features and measurements matched those of the original inoculum, thus fulfilling Koch's postulates. To our knowledge, this is the first report of downy mildew on I. walleriana in Hawai'i (2). The disease appears to be widespread throughout the islands and is likely to cause considerable losses in Hawai'ian landscapes and production settings. References: (1) O. Constantinescu.

30714121,The histidine decarboxylase model of tic pathophysiology: a new focus on the histamine H<sub>3</sub> receptor.,"Histamine dysregulation was implicated as a rare cause of Tourette syndrome and other tic disorders a decade ago by a landmark genetic study in a high density family pedigree, which implicated a hypomorphic mutation in the histidine decarboxylase (Hdc) gene as a rare but high penetrance genetic cause. Studies in Hdc knockout (KO) mice have confirmed that this mutation causes tic-relevant behavioural and neurochemical abnormalities that parallel what is seen in patients and thus validate the KO as a potentially informative model of tic pathophysiology. Recent studies have focused on the potential role of the histamine H<sub>3</sub> receptor in this model, and by association in tic disorders and related neuropsychiatric conditions. The H<sub>3</sub> receptor is up-regulated in the striatum in Hdc KO mice. As the H<sub>3</sub> receptor has constitutive activity in the absence of ligand, this receptor up-regulation may have significant cellular effects despite the absence of neurotransmitter histamine in these mice. Activation in vivo of H<sub>3</sub> receptors in wild type mice regulates signalling in striatal medium spiny neurons (MSNs) that interacts non-linearly with dopamine receptor signalling. Baseline signalling alterations in MSNs in Hdc KO mice resemble those seen after H<sub>3</sub> receptor agonist treatment in wild type animals. H<sub>3</sub> receptor agonist treatment in the KOs further accentuates most of these signalling abnormalities and produces behavioural stereotypy. Together, these data suggest the intriguing hypothesis that constitutive signalling by up-regulated H<sub>3</sub> receptors explains many of the molecular and behavioural abnormalities seen in these animals.

30722630,First Report of Powdery Mildew Caused by Erysiphe platani on Sycamore (Platanus occidentalis) in South Korea.,"Platanus occidentalis L. (sycamore) is an important shade tree distributed throughout the Northern Hemisphere and in South Korea. It has been widely used as an ornamental tree, especially in urban regions and by roadsides. The average rate of roadside planting throughout South Korea covers about 5.7% (up to 38% in Seoul), equivalent to 0.36 million trees. In early July 2012, after a rainy spell in summer, an outbreak of powdery mildew on sycamore was first observed on roadside trees in Gwangju, a southern province of South Korea. A more extensive nationwide survey revealed no powdery mildew in northern or central regions of South Korea. The disease has spread rapidly within Gwangju, even though fungicide applications were carried out after the rainy spell. Major symptoms included white, superficial mycelia, grey to brown lesions on the surface of the leaves due to the presence of a hyperparasite (tentatively identified as Ampelomyces sp.), a slight chlorosis, and severe leaf distortion followed by defoliation. Conidiophores were produced singly, straight, and unbranched, with lengths of 35.2 to 315.2 �m (average 170.4 �m). Conidia were ellipsoid or doliiform, ranging in size from 34.9 to 47.4 �m (average 38.2 �m) long � 16.5 to 26.8 �m (average 23.9 �m) wide. Primary conidia had a truncate base and rounded apex; secondary conidia had both a truncate base and apex. The conidial outer surface had a reticulated wrinkling. Cleistothecia (i.e., sexual spore structures) were not found during the survey, which extended from July to October. These characteristics and the host species match those of Microsphaera platani (syn. Erysiphe platani), which was described on P. occidentalis in Washington State (2). Fungal rDNA was amplified using primers ITS1 and LR5F (4) for one sample (EML-PLA1, GenBank JX485651). BLASTn searches of GenBank revealed high sequence identity to E. platani (99.5% to JQ365943 and 99.3% to JQ365940). Recently, Liang et al. (3) reported the first occurrence of powdery mildew by E. platani on P. orientalis in China based only on its morphology. Thus, in this study, author could only use ITS sequence data from the United States and Europe to characterize the isolate. To date, nine records of powdery mildews of Platanus spp. have been reported worldwide: on P. hispanica from Brazil, Japan, Hungary, and Slovakia; P. orientalis from Israel; P. racemosa from the United States; P. � acerifolia from the United Kingdom and Germany; and Platanus sp. from Argentina and Australia (1). Interestingly, the hyperparasite, Ampelomyces sp., was found with E. platani, suggesting that there may be some level of biocontrol in nature. Pathogenicity was confirmed by gently pressing diseased leaves onto six leaves of healthy sycamore plants in the field in September. The treated leaves were sealed in sterilized vinyl pack to maintain humid condition for 2 days. Similar symptoms were observed on the inoculated leaves 10 days after inoculation. Koch's postulates were fulfilled by re-observing the fungal pathogen. To our knowledge, this is the first report of powdery mildew caused by E. platani on sycamore in South Korea. References: (1) D.

30783000,Doravirine and the Potential for CYP3A-Mediated Drug-Drug Interactions.,"Identifying and understanding potential drug-drug interactions (DDIs) are vital for the treatment of human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) infection. This article discusses DDIs between doravirine, a nonnucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor (NNRTI), and cytochrome P450 3A (CYP3A) substrates and drugs that modulate CYP3A activity. Consistent with previously published <i>in vitro</i> data and DDI trials with the CYP3A substrates midazolam and atorvastatin, doravirine did not have any meaningful impact on the pharmacokinetics of the CYP3A substrates ethinyl estradiol and levonorgestrel. Coadministration of doravirine with CYP3A inhibitors (ritonavir or ketoconazole) increased doravirine exposure approximately 3-fold. However, these increases were not considered clinically meaningful. Conversely, previously published trials showed that coadministered CYP3A inducers (rifampin and rifabutin) decreased doravirine exposure by 88% and 50%, respectively (K. L. Yee, S. G. Khalilieh, R. I. Sanchez, R. Liu, et al., Clin Drug Investig 37:659-667, 2017 [https://doi.org/10.1007/s40261-017-0513-4]; S. G. Khalilieh, K. L. Yee, R. I. Sanchez, R. Liu, et al., J Clin Pharmacol 58:1044-1052, 2018 [https://doi.org/10.1002/jcph.1103]), while doravirine exposure following prior efavirenz administration led to an initial reduction in doravirine exposure of 62%, but the reduction became less pronounced with time (K. L. Yee, R. I. Sanchez, P. Auger, R. Liu, et al., Antimicrob Agents Chemother 61:e01757-16, 2017 [https://doi.org/10.1128/AAC.01757-16]). Overall, the coadministration of doravirine with CYP3A inhibitors and substrates is, therefore, supported by these data together with efficacy and safety data from clinical trials, while coadministration with strong CYP3A inducers, such as rifampin, cannot be recommended. Concomitant dosing with rifabutin (a CYP3A inducer less potent than rifampin) is acceptable if doravirine dosing is adjusted from once to twice daily; however, the effect of other moderate inducers on doravirine pharmacokinetics is unknown.","kes, hji",0.0,0,0,2,0.0,,
30832735,Ultrasound Elastography supplement assessing nodal status of magnetic resonance imaging staged cervical N0 patients with nasopharyngeal carcinoma.,"<h4>Background</h4>To determine whether ultrasound elastography can distinguish reactive or metastatic small lymph nodes (sLN) of magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) staged cervical N0 patients with nasopharyngeal carcinoma (NPC).<h4>Methods</h4>A pilot study was performed involving the diagnostic performances of conventional high-frequency ultrasound (CHFU) and/or shear wave elastography (SWE) for predicting metastases in sLN of MRI-staged N0 NPC patients with reference to the histologically-proven ultrasound guided core needle biopsy (US-CNB). The diagnosis of CHFU was based on the superficial lymph node ultrasonic criteria with the five-point-scale (FPS). The mean (Emean), minimum (Emin) and maximum (Emax) of the elasticity indices were measured by SWE at the stiffest part of the sLN in kilopascal. Diagnostic performances were analyzed using a receiver operating curve (ROC) on a per-node basis. The authenticity of this article has been validated by uploading the key raw data onto the Research Data Deposit public platform ( http://www.researchdata.org.cn ), with the approval RDD number as RDDA2017000447.<h4>Results</h4>All 113 cervical sLN of 49 MRI-staged cervical N0 NPC patients underwent evaluation of CHFU and SWE; 38 sLN (FPS < 2) were regarded as benign, which were excluded from subsequent analysis due to none biopsy-proven. And 75 indeterminate sLN (FPS�=�2) were referred to US-CNB and revealed 15 (20%) metastases. All SWE elastic indices were significantly higher in malignant sLNs than in benign sLNs (p�< 0.05). Moreover, Emax exhibited the highest diagnostic value (AUC:0.733 � 0.067, p�= 0.005) with excellent measurement reproducibility (ICC: 0.786; 95%CI: 0.684, 0.864). CHFU plus SWE was superior to CHFU or SWE alone for predicting metastases in sLN of MRI-staged N0 patients with NPC (p�< 0.001).<h4>Conclusions</h4>CHFU plus SWE is an optional non-invasive modality to supplement MRI in assessing cervical nodal status of patients with NPC.","kes, hji",0.0,0,0,2,0.0,,data deposited as referenced

30867992,Lightweight data management with dtool.,"The explosion in volumes and types of data has led to substantial challenges in data management. These challenges are often faced by front-line researchers who are already dealing with rapidly changing technologies and have limited time to devote to data management. There are good high-level guidelines for managing and processing scientific data. However, there is a lack of simple, practical tools to implement these guidelines. This is particularly problematic in a highly distributed research environment where needs differ substantially from group to group and centralised solutions are difficult to implement and storage technologies change rapidly. To meet these challenges we have developed dtool, a command line tool for managing data. The tool packages data and metadata into a unified whole, which we call a dataset. The dataset provides consistency checking and the ability to access metadata for both the whole dataset and individual files. The tool can store these datasets on several different storage systems, including a traditional file system, object store (S3 and Azure) and iRODS. It includes an application programming interface that can be used to incorporate it into existing pipelines and workflows. The tool has provided substantial process, cost, and peace-of-mind benefits to our data management practices and we want to share these benefits.

30918038,Relationship between sociodemographic factors and specialty destination of UK trainee doctors: a national cohort study.,"OBJECTIVES:Many countries are driving forward policies to widen the socioeconomic profile of medical students and to train more medical students for certain specialties. However, little is known about how socioeconomic origin relates to specialty choice. Nor is there a good understanding of the relationship between academic performance and specialty choice. To address these gaps, our aim was to identify the relationship between socioeconomic background, academic performance and accepted offers into specialty training. DESIGN:Longitudinal, cohort study using data from the UK Medical Education Database (https://www.ukmed.ac.uk/). PARTICIPANTS:6065 (60% females) UK doctors who accepted offers to a specialty training (residency) post after completing the 2-year generic foundation programme (UK Foundation Programme) between 2012 and 2014. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES:<U+03A7>2 tests were used to examine the relationships between sociodemographic characteristics, academic ability and the dependent variable, specialty choice. Multiple data imputation was used to address the issue of missing data. Multinomial regression was employed to test the independent variables in predicting the likelihood of choosing a given specialty. RESULTS:Participants pursuing careers in more competitive specialties had significantly higher academic scores than colleagues pursuing less competitive ones. After controlling for the presence of multiple factors, trainees who came from families where no parent was educated to a degree level had statistically significant lower odds of choosing careers in medical specialties relative to general practice (OR=0.78, 95% CI, 0.67 to 0.92). Students who entered medical school as school leavers, compared with mature students, had odds 1.2 times higher (95% CI, 1.04 to 1.56) of choosing surgical specialties than general practice. CONCLUSIONS:The data indicate a direct association between trainees' sociodemographic characteristics, academic ability and career choices. The findings can be used by medical school, training boards and workforce planners to inform recruitment and retention strategies.","kes, hji",0.0,0,0,2,0.0,,
30967119,Large-scale 3D chromatin reconstruction from chromosomal contacts.,"<h4>Background</h4>Recent advances in genome analysis have established that chromatin has preferred 3D conformations, which bring distant loci into contact. Identifying these contacts is important for us to understand possible interactions between these loci. This has motivated the creation of the Hi-C technology, which detects long-range chromosomal interactions. Distance geometry-based algorithms, such as ChromSDE and ShRec3D, have been able to utilize Hi-C data to infer 3D chromosomal structures. However, these algorithms, being matrix-based, are space- and time-consuming on very large datasets. A human genome of 100 kilobase resolution would involve ~30,000 loci, requiring gigabytes just in storing the matrices.<h4>Results</h4>We propose a succinct representation of the distance matrices which tremendously reduces the space requirement. We give a complete solution, called SuperRec, for the inference of chromosomal structures from Hi-C data, through iterative solving the large-scale weighted multidimensional scaling problem.<h4>Conclusions</h4>SuperRec runs faster than earlier systems without compromising on result accuracy.

Probabilities of care completion (Pcc) were calculated for pediatric (<18 years old) and adult conditions in all acute-care hospitals in each state. Using the Pcc, we constructed interactive heatmap visualizations for direct comparison of pediatric and adult hospital care systems.<h4>Results</h4>On average, across the 7 states, 70.6% of all hospitals had Pcc >0.5 for more than half of all adult conditions, whereas <14.9% of hospitals had Pcc >0.1 for half of pediatric conditions. Visualizations revealed wide variation among states with clearly apparent institutional dependencies and condition-specific gaps (full interactive versions are available at https://goo.gl/5t8vAw).<h4>Conclusions</h4>The functional disparities between pediatric and adult hospital care systems are substantial, and condition-specific differences should be considered in reimbursement strategies, disaster planning, network adequacy determinations, and public health planning.","kes, hji",0.0,0,0,2,0.0,,
30989232,Long-term Clinical Effectiveness of Ustekinumab in Patients with Crohn's Disease Who Failed Biologic Therapies: A National Cohort Study.,"<h4>Background</h4>Ustekinumab [UST] was recently approved in Europe for the treatment of moderate to severe Crohn's disease [CD]. Long-term real-world data are currently scarce for CD patients previously exposed to several biologics.<h4>Methods</h4>This is an observational, national, retrospective multicentre study. Patients received intravenous UST ~6 mg/kg at baseline, with 90 mg subcutaneously thereafter every 8 weeks. Response and remission rates were assessed at Weeks 8, 16, and 52.<h4>Results</h4>Data from 152 patients were analysed. All patients were exposed to at least one anti-TNFa agent, with 69.7% were exposed to even two anti-TNFa and vedolizumab. After 1 year, 42.1% and 25.7% of patients had experienced clinical response and clinical remission, respectively, and 38.8% and 24.3% had achieved steroid-free clinical response and remission, respectively; 38.8% of patients discontinued therapy during the 12 months of follow-up. Colonic location was predictive of clinical response at 1 year, and low body mass index [BMI] at baseline was a negative predictor of clinical remission. Resolution of arthralgia was associated with clinical response over time. De novo arthralgia was reported by 17.9% of patients at Week 8 and 13.5% of patients at Week 52. No impact of UST on arthralgia was observed in patients with concomitant ankylosing spondylitis [n = 17]. Others adverse events were reported in 7.2% of patients.<h4>Conclusions</h4>This real-world cohort study confirms the effectiveness of UST in CD patients previously exposed to several biologics. Ustekinumab was well tolerated with respect to adverse events.<h4>Podcast</h4>This article has an associated podcast which can be accessed at https://academic.oup.com/ecco-jcc/pages/podcast.","kes, hji",0.0,0,0,2,0.0,,
31001324,BayesPI-BAR2: A New Python Package for Predicting Functional Non-coding Mutations in Cancer Patient Cohorts.,"Most of somatic mutations in cancer occur outside of gene coding regions. These mutations may disrupt the gene regulation by affecting protein-DNA interaction. A study of these disruptions is important in understanding tumorigenesis. However, current computational tools process DNA sequence variants individually, when predicting the effect on protein-DNA binding. Thus, it is a daunting task to identify functional regulatory disturbances among thousands of mutations in a patient. Previously, we have reported and validated a pipeline for identifying functional non-coding somatic mutations in cancer patient cohorts, by integrating diverse information such as gene expression, spatial distribution of the mutations, and a biophysical model for estimating protein binding affinity. Here, we present a new user-friendly Python package BayesPI-BAR2 based on the proposed pipeline for integrative whole-genome sequence analysis. This may be the first prediction package that considers information from both multiple mutations and multiple patients. It is evaluated in follicular lymphoma and skin cancer patients, by focusing on sequence variants in gene promoter regions. BayesPI-BAR2 is a useful tool for predicting functional non-coding mutations in whole genome sequencing data: it allows identification of novel transcription factors (TFs) whose binding is altered by non-coding mutations in cancer. BayesPI-BAR2 program can analyze multiple datasets of genome-wide mutations at once and generate concise, easily interpretable reports for potentially affected gene regulatory sites. The package is freely available at http://folk.uio.no/junbaiw/BayesPI-BAR2/.","kes, hji",0.0,0,0,2,0.0,,

Since the release of the MS�PIP web server in 2015, we have brought significant updates to both the tool and the web server. In addition to the original models for CID and HCD fragmentation, we have added specialized models for the TripleTOF 5600+ mass spectrometer, for TMT-labeled peptides, for iTRAQ-labeled peptides, and for iTRAQ-labeled phosphopeptides. Because the fragmentation pattern is heavily altered in each of these cases, these additional models greatly improve the prediction accuracy for their corresponding data types. We have also substantially reduced the computational resources required to run MS�PIP, and have completely rebuilt the web server, which now allows predictions of up to 100 000 peptide sequences in a single request.

31031918,Future temperature and salinity do not exert selection pressure on cyst germination of a toxic phytoplankton species.,"Environmental conditions regulate the germination of phytoplankton resting stages. While some factors lead to synchronous germination, others stimulate germination of only a small fraction of the resting stages. This suggests that habitat filters may act on the germination level and thus affect selection of blooming strains. Benthic """"seed banks"""" of the toxic dinoflagellate <i>Alexandrium ostenfeldii</i> from the Baltic Sea are genetically and phenotypically diverse, indicating a high potential for adaptation by selection on standing genetic variation. Here, we experimentally tested the role of climate-related salinity and temperature as selection filters during germination and subsequent establishment of <i>A.�ostenfeldii</i> strains. A representative resting cyst population was isolated from sediment samples, and germination and reciprocal transplantation experiments were carried out, including four treatments: Average present day germination conditions and three potential future conditions: high temperature, low salinity, and high temperature in combination with low salinity. We found that the final germination success of <i>A.�ostenfeldii</i> resting cysts was unaffected by temperature and salinity in the range tested. A high germination success of more than 80% in all treatments indicates that strains are not selected by temperature and salinity during germination, but selection becomes more important shortly after germination, in the vegetative stage of the life cycle. Moreover, strains were not adapted to germination conditions. Instead, highly plastic responses occurred after transplantation and significantly higher growth rates were observed at higher temperature. High variability of strain-specific responses has probably masked the overall effect of the treatments, highlighting the importance of testing the effect of environmental factors on many strains. It is likely that <i>A.�ostenfeldii</i> populations can persist in the future, because suitable strains, which are able to germinate and grow well at potential future climate conditions, are part of the highly diverse cyst population.<h4>Open research badges</h4>This article has earned an Open Data Badge for making publicly available the digitally-shareable data necessary to reproduce the reported results.

It is the hope that this Guideline becomes a reference for effective evidence-based surgical management of LUTS/BPH.<h4>Materials and methods</h4>The evidence team searched Ovid MEDLINE, the Cochrane Library, and the Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality database to identify studies indexed between January 2007-September 2017. Following initial publication, this guideline was amended in 2019 and reflects relevant literature published through January 2019. When sufficient evidence existed, the body of evidence was assigned a strength rating of A (high), B (moderate), or C (low) for support of Strong, Moderate, or Conditional Recommendations. In the absence of sufficient evidence, additional information is provided as Clinical Principles and Expert Opinions (table 1 in supplementary unabridged guideline, https://www.jurology.com).<h4>Results</h4>This Guideline provides evidence-based recommendations regarding management of LUTS/BPH utilizing surgery and minimally invasive surgical therapies (MIST). Additional statements are made regarding diagnostic and pre-operative tests. Clinical statements are made in comparison to what is generally accepted as the gold standard (i.e. transurethral resection of the prostate [TURP] monopolar and/or bipolar). This guideline is designed to be used in conjunction with the associated treatment algorithm (see figure).[Figure: see text]Conclusions:The prevalence and the severity of LUTS increases as men age and is an important diagnosis in the healthcare of patients and the welfare of society.

31093959,Sex differences in the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis: An obstacle to antidepressant drug development?,"Hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis dysfunction has long been implicated in the pathophysiology of depression, and HPA axis-based compounds have served as potential new therapeutic targets, but with no success. This review details sex differences from animal and human studies in the function of HPA axis elements (glucocorticoids, corticotropin releasing factor, and vasopressin) and related compounds tested as candidate antidepressants. We propose that sex differences contribute to the failure of novel HPA axis-based drugs in clinical trials. Compounds studied preclinically in males were tested in clinical trials that recruited more, if not exclusively, women, and did not control, but rather adjusted, for potential sex differences. Indeed, clinical trials of antidepressants are usually not stratified by sex or other important factors, although preclinical and epidemiological data support such stratification. In conclusion, we suggest that clinical testing of HPA axis-related compounds creates an opportunity for targeted, personalized antidepressant treatments based on sex.

NGSEP consistently shows comparative accuracy and better efficiency compared to the existing solutions. We expect that this work will contribute to the continuous improvement of quality in variant calling needed for modern applications in medicine and agriculture.<h4>Availability and implementation</h4>NGSEP is available as open source software at http://ngsep.sf.net.<h4>Supplementary information</h4>Supplementary data are available at Bioinformatics online.","kes, hji",0.0,0,0,2,0.0,,
31112088,Using Artificial Intelligence to Revise ACR TI-RADS Risk Stratification of Thyroid Nodules: Diagnostic Accuracy and Utility.,"Background Risk stratification systems for thyroid nodules are often complicated and affected by low specificity. Continual improvement of these systems is necessary to reduce the number of unnecessary thyroid biopsies. Purpose To use artificial intelligence (AI) to optimize the American College of Radiology (ACR) Thyroid Imaging Reporting and Data System (TI-RADS). Materials and Methods A total of 1425 biopsy-proven thyroid nodules from 1264 consecutive patients (1026 women; mean age, 52.9 years [range, 18-93 years]) were evaluated retrospectively. Expert readers assigned points based on five ACR TI-RADS categories (composition, echogenicity, shape, margin, echogenic foci), and a genetic AI algorithm was applied to a training set (1325 nodules). Point and pathologic data were used to create an optimized scoring system (hereafter, AI TI-RADS). Performance of the systems was compared by using a test set of the final 100 nodules with interpretations from the expert reader, eight nonexpert readers, and an expert panel. Initial performance of AI TI-RADS was calculated by using a test for differences between binomial proportions. Additional comparisons across readers were conducted by using bootstrapping; diagnostic performance was assessed by using area under the receiver operating curve. Results AI TI-RADS assigned new point values for eight ACR TI-RADS features. Six features were assigned zero points, which simplified categorization. By using expert reader data, the diagnostic performance of ACR TI-RADS and AI TI-RADS was area under the receiver operating curve of 0.91 and 0.93, respectively. For the same expert, specificity of AI TI-RADS (65%, 55 of 85) was higher (P < .001) than that of ACR TI-RADS (47%, 40 of 85). For the eight nonexpert radiologists, mean specificity for AI TI-RADS (55%) was also higher (P < .001) than that of ACR TI-RADS (48%). An interactive AI TI-RADS calculator can be viewed at http://deckard.duhs.duke.edu/~ai-ti-rads . Conclusion An artificial intelligence-optimized Thyroid Imaging Reporting and Data System (TI-RADS) validates the American College of Radiology TI-RADS while slightly improving specificity and maintaining sensitivity. Additionally, it simplifies feature assignments, which may improve ease of use. � RSNA, 2019 Online supplemental material is available for this article.","kes, hji",0.0,0,0,2,0.0,,
31112286,Urinary tract infection prevention after midurethral slings in pelvic floor reconstructive surgery: A systematic review and meta-analysis.,"INTRODUCTION:Synthetic midurethral slings are the most common procedures currently performed for stress urinary incontinence in women. Infection is a frequent complication of urogynecologic surgery. We performed a systematic review and meta-analysis to identify interventions that successfully prevent infections, including urinary tract infection (UTI) and/or bacteriuria, compared with no intervention, in women undergoing midurethral sling surgery with or without concomitant pelvic reconstructive procedures for prolapse. MATERIAL AND METHODS:The primary outcome was the development of any infection post-midurethral sling placement in women. MEDLINE, Embase, CINAHL and the Cochrane Library were searched for comparative studies from inception to July 2017, with no language restrictions. We used search terms related to midurethral sling, infections and infection-reduction interventions. Two independent reviewers abstracted data and assessed study quality. Pooled effect size estimates were calculated. We conducted meta-analysis of eligible studies. A protocol for this review has been registered and can be accessed online (http://hdl.handle.net/2429/64731). RESULTS:We identified seven eligible studies of infection risk-reducing interventions; all focused on UTIs. Only one study assessed preoperative antibiotics with midurethral sling alone and was halted early because of low UTI rates. All other studies (three randomized control trials and three observational studies) examined whether postoperative antibiotics decrease UTI/bacteriuria rates after midurethral sling with or without reconstructive procedures for pelvic organ prolapse and using bladder catheterization postoperatively. Due to considerable clinical heterogeneity, we only combined four studies for meta-analysis. Postoperative oral prophylactic nitrofurantoin showed no significant benefit in reducing UTI/bacteriuria in women post-midurethral sling with or without concomitant reconstructive pelvic surgery and the need for bladder catheterization, when compared with the reference group (pooled relative risk 0.73, 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.42-1.25). CONCLUSIONS:Based on the best available evidence, postoperative oral nitrofurantoin is not effective at reducing UTI/bacteriuria rates in catheterized women after midurethral sling with or without concomitant pelvic reconstructive surgery for prolapse. For midurethral sling alone, preoperative antibiotic prophylaxis may not be needed for UTI prevention.","kes, hji",0.0,0,0,2,0.0,,
31150060,Augmented Interval List: a novel data structure for efficient genomic interval search.,"<h4>Motivation</h4>Genomic data is frequently stored as segments or intervals. Because this data type is so common, interval-based comparisons are fundamental to genomic analysis. As the volume of available genomic data grows, developing efficient and scalable methods for searching interval data is necessary.<h4>Results</h4>We present a new data structure, the Augmented Interval List (AIList), to enumerate intersections between a query interval q and an interval set R. An AIList is constructed by first sorting R as a list by the interval start coordinate, then decomposing it into a few approximately flattened components (sublists), and then augmenting each sublist with the running maximum interval end. The query time for AIList is O(log2N+n+m), where n is the number of overlaps between R and q, N is the number of intervals in the set R and m is the average number of extra comparisons required to find the n overlaps. Tested on real genomic interval datasets, AIList code runs 5-18 times faster than standard high-performance code based on augmented interval-trees, nested containment lists or R-trees (BEDTools). For large datasets, the memory-usage for AIList is 4-60% of other methods. The AIList data structure, therefore, provides a significantly improved fundamental operation for highly scalable genomic data analysis.<h4>Availability and implementation</h4>An implementation of the AIList data structure with both construction and search algorithms is available at http://ailist.databio.org.<h4>Supplementary information</h4>Supplementary data are available at Bioinformatics online.","kes, hji",0.0,0,0,2,0.0,,

(Vochysiaceae) by LC-MS/MS Label-Free Identification in Response to Aluminum.,"This dataset brief is about the descriptive proteome of Qualea grandiflora plants by label free mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS). Q. grandiflora is a plant that accumulates aluminum (Al) in high quantities and requires it for growth and development. Although quite relevant for the understanding of Al effects on plants, the proteome of Q. grandiflora has not been studied yet. Therefore, the current proteome analysis identifies a total of 2010 proteins. Furthermore, the identified Q. grandiflora root proteins are associated with several crucial molecular functions, biological processes, and cellular sites. Hence, the proteome analysis of Q. grandiflora will contribute to unravel how plants evolved to cope with high levels of Al in soils.

31179198,An Emergent Space for Distributed Data with Hidden Internal Order through Manifold Learning.,"Manifold-learning techniques are routinely used in mining complex spatiotemporal data to extract useful, parsimonious data representations/parametrizations; these are, in turn, useful in nonlinear model identification tasks. We focus here on the case of time series data that can ultimately be modelled as a spatially distributed system (e.g. a partial differential equation, PDE), but where we do not know the space in which this PDE should be formulated. Hence, even the spatial coordinates for the distributed system themselves need to be identified - to """"emerge from""""-the data mining process. We will first validate this """"emergent space"""" reconstruction for time series sampled <i>without space labels</i> in known PDEs; this brings up the issue of observability of physical space from temporal observation data, and the transition from spatially resolved to lumped (order-parameter-based) representations by tuning the scale of the data mining kernels. We will then present actual emergent space """"discovery"""" illustrations. Our illustrative examples include chimera states (states of coexisting coherent and incoherent dynamics), and chaotic as well as quasiperiodic spatiotemporal dynamics, arising in partial differential equations and/or in heterogeneous networks. We also discuss how data-driven """"spatial"""" coordinates can be extracted in ways invariant to the nature of the measuring instrument. Such gauge-invariant data mining can go beyond the fusion of heterogeneous observations of the same system, to the possible matching of apparently different systems.

It is possible that participant's characteristics measured at baseline can identify people with chronic low back pain who would respond best to a treatment based on the Movement System Impairment model.<h4>Objectives</h4>To assess if specific characteristics of people with chronic low back pain measured at baseline can modify the effects of a treatment based on the Movement System Impairment model on pain and disability.<h4>Methods</h4>Four variables assessed at baseline that could potentially modify the treatment effects of the treatment based on the Movement System Impairment model were selected (age, educational status, physical activity status and STarT back tool classification). Separate univariate models were used to investigate a possible modifier treatment effect of baseline participant's characteristics on pain and disability after the treatment. Findings of interaction values above 1 point for the outcome mean pain intensity or above 3 points for disability (Roland Morris questionnaire) were considered clinically relevant.<h4>Results</h4>Linear regression analyses for the outcomes of pain and disability did not show interaction values considered clinically relevant for age, educational status, physical activity status and STarT back tool classification.<h4>Conclusion</h4>Age, educational status, physical activity status and STarT back tool classification did not modify the effects of an 8-week treatment based on the Movement System Impairment model in patients with chronic low back pain.

31236209,The research crisis in American institutions of complementary and integrative health: one proposed solution for chiropractic profession.,"A crisis confronts the Complementary and Integrative Health (CIH) teaching institutions in the US. Research infrastructure is needed to build and sustain productive research programs and retain their own research faculty. In most health professions, this infrastructure is largely built through research grants. In CIH, most educational institutions are funded through student tuition, which has historically also had to be the source for building their research programs. Only a limited number of these institutions have emerged as National Institute of Health (NIH) grant-funded programs. As a result, the American chiropractic institutions have seen a retrenchment in the number of active research programs. In addition, although research training programs e.g., NIH's K awards are available for CIH researchers, these programs generally result in these researchers leaving their institutions and depriving future CIH practitioners of the benefit of being trained in a culture of research. One proposed solution is to leverage the substantial research infrastructure and long history of collaboration available at the RAND Corporation (https://www.rand.org) This article presents the proposed five components of the RAND Center for Collaborative CIH Research and the steps required to bring it to being: 1) the CIH Research Network - an online resource and collaborative site for CIH researchers; 2) the CIH Research Advisory Board - the governing body for the Center selected by its members; 3) the RAND CIH Interest Group - a group of RAND researchers with an interest in and who could provide support to CIH research; 4) CIH Researcher Training - access to existing RAND research training as well as the potential for the Center to provide a research training home for those with training grants; and 5) CIH RAND Partnership for Research - a mentorship program to support successful CIH research. By necessity the first step in the Center's creation would be a meeting between the heads of interested CIH institutions to work out the details and to obtain buy-in. The future success of CIH-directed research on CIH will require a pooling of talent and resources across institutions; something that the American chiropractic institutions have not yet been able to achieve.

However, the combination of the complexity of atopic allergy susceptibility/development and environmental factors has made identification of gene biomarkers challenging. The amount of publicly accessible transcriptomic data presents an unprecedented opportunity for mechanistic discoveries and validation of complex disease signatures across studies. However, this necessitates structured methodologies and visual tools for the interpretation of results. Here, we present a curated collection of transcriptomic datasets relevant to immunoglobin E-mediated atopic diseases (ranging from allergies to primary immunodeficiencies). Thirty-three datasets from the Gene Expression Omnibus, encompassing 1860 transcriptome profiles, were made available on the Gene Expression Browser (GXB), an online and open-source web application that allows for the query, visualization and annotation of metadata.

31301205,The Generation of a Comprehensive Spectral Library for the Analysis of the Guinea Pig Proteome by SWATH-MS.,"Advances in liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry have facilitated the incorporation of proteomic studies to many biology experimental workflows. Data-independent acquisition platforms, such as sequential window acquisition of all theoretical mass spectra (SWATH-MS), offer several advantages for label-free quantitative assessment of complex proteomes over data-dependent acquisition (DDA) approaches. However, SWATH data interpretation requires spectral libraries as a detailed reference resource. The guinea pig (Cavia porcellus) is an excellent experimental model for translation to many aspects of human physiology and disease, yet there is limited experimental information regarding its proteome. To overcome this knowledge gap, a comprehensive spectral library of the guinea pig proteome is generated. Homogenates and tryptic digests are prepared from 16 tissues and subjected to >200 DDA runs. Analysis of >250�000 peptide-spectrum matches resulted in a library of 73�594 peptides from 7666 proteins. Library validation is provided by i) analyzing externally derived SWATH files (https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jprot.2018.03.023) and comparing peptide intensity quantifications; ii) merging of externally derived data to the base library. This furnishes the research community with a comprehensive proteomic resource that will facilitate future molecular-phenotypic studies using (re-engaging) the guinea pig as an experimental model of relevance to human biology.

Substantial efforts are now devoted to biobank projects to collect large genetic and phenotypic data, providing unprecedented opportunity for genetic discovery and applications. To process the large-scale data provided by such biobank resources, highly efficient and scalable methods and software are required.<h4>Results</h4>Here we introduce PRSice-2, an efficient and scalable software program for automating and simplifying PRS analyses on large-scale data. PRSice-2 handles both genotyped and imputed data, provides empirical association P-values free from inflation due to overfitting, supports different inheritance models, and can evaluate multiple continuous and binary target traits simultaneously. We demonstrate that PRSice-2 is dramatically faster and more memory-efficient than PRSice-1 and alternative PRS software, LDpred and lassosum, while having comparable predictive power.<h4>Conclusion</h4>PRSice-2's combination of efficiency and power will be increasingly important as data sizes grow and as the applications of PRS become more sophisticated, e.g., when incorporated into high-dimensional or gene set-based analyses.

31368479,Bayesian estimation of genetic regulatory effects in high-throughput reporter assays.,"<h4>Motivation</h4>High-throughput reporter assays dramatically improve our ability to assign function to noncoding genetic variants, by measuring allelic effects on gene expression in the controlled setting of a reporter gene. Unlike genetic association tests, such assays are not confounded by linkage disequilibrium when loci are independently assayed. These methods can thus improve the identification of causal disease mutations. While work continues on improving experimental aspects of these assays, less effort has gone into developing methods for assessing the statistical significance of assay results, particularly in the case of rare variants captured from patient DNA.<h4>Results</h4>We describe a Bayesian hierarchical model, called Bayesian Inference of Regulatory Differences, which integrates prior information and explicitly accounts for variability between experimental replicates. The model produces substantially more accurate predictions than existing methods when allele frequencies are low, which is of clear advantage in the search for disease-causing variants in DNA captured from patient cohorts. Using the model, we demonstrate a clear tradeoff between variant sequencing coverage and numbers of biological replicates, and we show that the use of additional biological replicates decreases variance in estimates of effect size, due to the properties of the Poisson-binomial distribution. We also provide a power and sample size calculator, which facilitates decision making in experimental design parameters.<h4>Availability and implementation</h4>The software is freely available from www.geneprediction.org/bird.

31400221,Alternating EM algorithm for a bilinear model in isoform quantification from RNA-seq data.,"<h4>Motivation</h4>Estimation of isoform-level gene expression from RNA-seq data depends on simplifying assumptions, such as uniform read distribution, that are easily violated in real data. Such violations typically lead to biased estimates. Most existing methods provide bias correction step(s), which is based on biological considerations-such as GC content-and applied in single samples separately. The main problem is that not all biases are known.<h4>Results</h4>We have developed a novel method called XAEM based on a more flexible and robust statistical model. Existing methods are essentially based on a linear model X�, where the design matrix X is known and is computed based on the simplifying assumptions. In contrast XAEM considers X� as a bilinear model with both X and � unknown. Joint estimation of X and � is made possible by a simultaneous analysis of multi-sample RNA-seq data. Compared to existing methods, XAEM automatically performs empirical correction of potentially unknown biases. We use an alternating expectation-maximization (AEM) algorithm, alternating between estimation of X and �. For speed XAEM utilizes quasi-mapping for read alignment, thus leading to a fast algorithm. Overall XAEM performs favorably compared to recent advanced methods. For simulated datasets, XAEM obtains higher accuracy for multiple-isoform genes. In a differential-expression analysis of a real single-cell RNA-seq dataset, XAEM achieves substantially better rediscovery rates in independent validation sets.<h4>Availability and implementation</h4>The method and pipeline are implemented as a tool and freely available for use at http://fafner.meb.ki.se/biostatwiki/xaem/.<h4>Supplementary information</h4>Supplementary data are available at Bioinformatics online.","kes, hji",0.0,0,0,2,0.0,,
31431912,Data from quantitative serum proteomic analysis after laparoscopic gastric plication.,"Bariatric surgery is an effective treatment for morbid obesity with a sustained weight loss and improvements in metabolic syndrome. We present a label free quantitative shotgun proteomics approach to analyze the serum proteome of obese people who underwent Laparoscopic Gastric Plication (LGP) as a new bariatric surgery. Pre-surgery serum samples of obese individuals were compared with the serum of the same subjects 1-2 months post-surgery (T1) and 4-5 months post-surgery (T2). The data provide a list of 224 quantifiable proteins with at least two unique peptides that were quantifiable in at least 70% of samples. Gene ontology biological processes and molecular functions of differentially regulated proteins between pre- and post-surgery samples were investigated using WebGestalt online tool. In addition, molecular networks of differentially abundant proteins were determined through Ingenuity Pathway Analysis (IPA) software.

31439548,Meflin-Positive Cancer-Associated Fibroblasts Inhibit Pancreatic Carcinogenesis.,"Cancer-associated fibroblasts (CAF) constitute a major component of the tumor microenvironment. Recent observations in genetically engineered mouse models and clinical studies have suggested that there may exist at least two functionally different populations of CAFs, that is, cancer-promoting CAFs (pCAF) and cancer-restraining CAFs (rCAF). Although various pCAF markers have been identified, the identity of rCAFs remains unknown because of the lack of rCAF-specific marker(s). In this study, we found that Meflin, a glycosylphosphatidylinositol-anchored protein that is a marker of mesenchymal stromal/stem cells and maintains their undifferentiated state, is expressed by pancreatic stellate cells that are a source of CAFs in pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC). <i>In situ</i> hybridization analysis of 71 human PDAC tissues revealed that the infiltration of Meflin-positive CAFs correlated with favorable patient outcome. Consistent herewith, Meflin deficiency led to significant tumor progression with poorly differentiated histology in a PDAC mouse model. Similarly, genetic ablation of Meflin-positive CAFs resulted in poor differentiation of tumors in a syngeneic transplantation model. Conversely, delivery of a Meflin-expressing lentivirus into the tumor stroma or overexpression of Meflin in CAFs suppressed the growth of xenograft tumors. Lineage tracing revealed that Meflin-positive cells gave rise to a-smooth muscle actin-positive CAFs that are positive or negative for Meflin, suggesting a mechanism for generating CAF heterogeneity. Meflin deficiency or low expression resulted in straightened stromal collagen fibers, which represent a signature for aggressive tumors, in mouse or human PDAC tissues, respectively. Together, the data suggest that Meflin is a marker of rCAFs that suppress PDAC progression. SIGNIFICANCE: Meflin marks and functionally contributes to a subset of cancer-associated fibroblasts that exert antitumoral effects.<b>Graphical Abstract:</b> http://cancerres.aacrjournals.org/content/canres/79/20/5367/F1.large.jpg.","kes, hji",0.0,0,0,2,0.0,,
31448721,Renal length and volume prediction in healthy children.,"<h4>Introduction</h4>Little information is available regarding the evaluation of renal volume in healthy Latin-American children of different ages. The objective of this work was to establish a predictive model of renal size (volume and length) and develop a web-based calculator.<h4>Materials and methods</h4>A selective and representative sample was obtained randomly from the database of healthy children living in Resistencia city, Chaco, Argentina: a) the National Health Program for children under 6 years old; b)�school children until 18 years old (primary and middle education). Renal dimensions were obtained by ultrasonography via a single experienced operator at the indicated site (schools or primary health care centers). Renal volume was calculated using Dinkel's formula. A multiple linear regression model was applied using potential predictors. The final model was implemented in a free web-based application.<h4>Results</h4>Random selection was made from the database to include 882 subjects with ages between 0.03 and 230.63 months. The data was divided into two sets (one for training and the other for model testing). The training set (423) included 212 (50%) females. Significant predictors included age, height, current weight and birth weight, and the interaction between age and present weight. Using the test dataset, both renal volume and length root mean square errors were 5.06 cm<sup>3</sup> and 0.59 cm.<h4>Conclusion</h4>The prediction model was accurate and allowed for the development a freely-available web app: Renal size prediction (https://porbm28.shinyapps.io/RenalVolume/). Once the models are validated by additional studies, the app could be a useful tool to predict renal volume and length in pediatric clinical practice.","kes, hji",0.0,0,0,2,0.0,,
31508533,Magnesium supplementation therapy to prevent cisplatin-induced acute nephrotoxicity in pediatric cancer: A protocol for a randomized phase 2 trial.,"Although cisplatin is one of the most effective agents against various pediatric cancers, it is sometimes difficult to manage due to its dose-limiting nephrotoxicity. Magnesium sulfate (Mg) showed a kidney-protective effect against cisplatin-induced nephrotoxicity (CIN) by regulating renal platinum accumulation both in vitro and in vivo, and the body of clinical data demonstrating the efficacy of this drug in adult cancer patients is increasing.In this open, multicenter, phase-2, randomized trial, patients under age 18 years who are scheduled to receive cisplatin-containing chemotherapy will be enrolled and randomly allocated either to an Mg supplementation arm in even-numbered chemotherapy courses (arm AB) or to another arm in odd-numbered courses (arm BA), with a 1:1 allocation. Analysis objects will be reconstructed into two groups depending on whether the chemotherapy course has Mg supplementation (group B) or not (group A). The primary endpoint is the proportion of chemotherapy courses resulting in elevated serum creatinine equal to or greater than 50% of the prechemotherapy value. For the secondary endpoints, various parameters for measuring kidney function, such as serum cystatin-C, B2M, L-FABP, NGAL, and urinary NAG in the two groups will be compared. A sample size based on alpha�=�5% and 80% power requires at least 40 samples per group (ideally, 60 samples per group).If Mg demonstrates efficacy, a phase-3 study to confirm the prophylactic effect of Mg supplementation in both acute and chronic CIN will be developed using novel and better biomarkers.

31633588,Widespread Pain Is Associated with Increased Risk of No Clinical Improvement After TKA in Women.,"<h4>Background</h4>When conservative treatments do not work, TKA may be the best option for patients with knee osteoarthritis, although a relatively large proportion of individuals do not have clinically important improvement after TKA. Evidence also suggests that women are less likely to benefit from TKA than men, but the reasons are unclear. Widespread pain disproportionately affects women and has been associated with worse outcomes after joint arthroplasty, yet it is unknown if the effect of widespread pain on TKA outcomes differs by patient gender.<h4>Questions/purposes</h4>(1) Does the association between widespread pain and no clinically important improvement in osteoarthritis-related pain and disability 2 years after TKA differ between men and women? (2) Does the use of pain medications 2 years after TKA differ between those with widespread pain and those without widespread pain before surgery?<h4>Methods</h4>Osteoarthritis Initiative (https://nda.nih.gov/oai/) study participants were followed annually from March 2005 until October 2015. Participants who underwent TKA up to the 7-year follow-up visit with pain/disability assessment at the protocol-planned visit before TKA and at the second planned annual visit after surgery were included in the analysis. Among 4796 study participants, 391 had a confirmed TKA, including 315 with pain/disability assessment at the protocol-planned visit before TKA. Overall, 95% of participants (298) had the required follow-up assessment; 5% (17) did not have follow-up data. Widespread pain was defined based on the modified American College of Rheumatology criteria. Symptoms were assessed using the WOMAC pain (range 0 to 20; higher score, more pain) and disability (range 0 to 68; higher score, more disability) scores, and the Knee Injury and Osteoarthritis Outcome Score for pain (range 0 to 100; higher score, less pain). Improvements in pain and disability were classified based on improvement from established clinically important differences (decrease in WOMAC pain = 1.5; decrease in WOMAC disability = 6.0; increase in Knee Injury and Osteoarthritis Outcome Score for pain = 9). At baseline, more women presented with widespread pain than men (45% [84 of 184] versus 32% [36 of 114]). Probability and the relative risk (RR) of no clinically important improvement were estimated using a logistic regression analysis in which participants with widespread pain and those without were compared. The analyses were done for men and women separately, then adjusted for depression and baseline outcome scores.<h4>Results</h4>Among women, preoperative widespread pain was associated with an increased risk of no clinically important improvement 2 years after TKA, based on WOMAC pain scores (13.5% versus 4.6%; RR 2.93 [95% CI 1.18 to 7.30]; p = 0.02) and the Knee Injury and Osteoarthritis Outcome Score for pain (16.5% versus 4.9%; RR 3.39 [95% CI 1.34 to 8.59]; p = 0.02). Given the lower and upper limits of the confidence intervals, our data are compatible with a broad range of disparate associations between widespread pain and lack of clinically important improvement in WOMAC pain scores (RR 0.77 [95% CI 0.22 to 2.70]; p = 0.68) and the Knee Injury and Osteoarthritis Outcome Score for pain (RR 1.37 [95% CI 0.47 to 4.00]; p = 0.57) among men, as well as clinically important improvement in WOMAC disability scores among men (RR 0.72 [95% CI 0.20 to 2.55]; p = 0.61) and women (RR 1.98 [95% CI 0.92 to 4.26]; p = 0.08). Participants presenting with widespread pain before TKA were more likely than those without widespread pain to use medication for symptoms of knee osteoarthritis most days for at least 1 month 2 years after TKA (51% [61 of 120] versus 32% [57 of 178]; mean difference, 18.8 [95% CI 7.3 to 30.1]; p < 0.01).<h4>Conclusions</h4>Widespread pain before TKA was associated with an increased risk of no clinically important improvement in knee pain 2 years postoperatively among women. Because of the small number of men with widespread pain in the sample, the results for men were inconclusive. In clinical practice, screening TKA candidates for widespread pain may be useful, and expectations of surgical outcomes may need to be tempered if patients have a concurrent diagnosis of widespread pain. Future studies should include more men with widespread pain and investigate if treatment of widespread pain before or concurrent with TKA surgery may improve surgical outcomes.<h4>Level of evidence</h4>Level III, therapeutic study.","kes, hji",0.0,0,0,2,0.0,,

31730280,Temperature dependence of NMR chemical shifts: Tracking and statistical analysis.,"Isotropic chemical shifts measured by solution nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy offer extensive insights into protein structure and dynamics. Temperature dependences add a valuable dimension; notably, the temperature dependences of amide proton chemical shifts are valuable probes of hydrogen bonding, temperature-dependent loss of structure, and exchange between distinct protein conformations. Accordingly, their uses include structural analysis of both folded and disordered proteins, and determination of the effects of mutations, binding, or solution conditions on protein energetics. Fundamentally, these temperature dependences result from changes in the local magnetic environments of nuclei, but correlations with global thermodynamic parameters measured via calorimetric methods have been observed. Although the temperature dependences of amide proton and nitrogen chemical shifts are often well approximated by a linear model, deviations from linearity are also observed and may be interpreted as evidence of fast exchange between distinct conformational states. Here, we describe computational methods, accessible via the Shift-T web server, including an automated tracking algorithm that propagates initial (single temperature) <sup>1</sup> H<U+F8FF><sup>15</sup> N cross peak assignments to spectra collected over a range of temperatures. Amide proton and nitrogen temperature coefficients (slopes determined by fitting chemical shift vs. temperature data to a linear model) are subsequently calculated. Also included are methods for the detection of systematic, statistically significant deviation from linearity (curvature) in the temperature dependences of amide proton chemical shifts. The use and utility of these methods are illustrated by example, and the Shift-T web server is freely available at http://meieringlab.uwaterloo.ca/shiftt.","kes, hji",0.0,0,0,2,0.0,,

31784425,Single-Cell Gene Expression Analyses Reveal Distinct Self-Renewing and Proliferating Subsets in the Leukemia Stem Cell Compartment in Acute Myeloid Leukemia.,"Standard chemotherapy for acute myeloid leukemia (AML) targets proliferative cells and efficiently induces complete remission; however, many patients relapse and die of their disease. Relapse is caused by leukemia stem cells (LSC), the cells with self-renewal capacity. Self-renewal and proliferation are separate functions in normal hematopoietic stem cells (HSC) in steady-state conditions. If these functions are also separate functions in LSCs, then antiproliferative therapies may fail to target self-renewal, allowing for relapse. We investigated whether proliferation and self-renewal are separate functions in LSCs as they often are in HSCs. Distinct transcriptional profiles within LSCs of Mll-AF9/NRASG12V murine AML were identified using single-cell RNA sequencing. Single-cell qPCR revealed that these genes were also differentially expressed in primary human LSCs and normal human HSPCs. A smaller subset of these genes was upregulated in LSCs relative to HSPCs; this subset of genes constitutes """"LSC-specific"""" genes in human AML. To assess the differences between these profiles, we identified cell surface markers, CD69 and CD36, whose genes were differentially expressed between these profiles. In vivo mouse reconstitution assays resealed that only CD69High LSCs were capable of self-renewal and were poorly proliferative. In contrast, CD36High LSCs were unable to transplant leukemia but were highly proliferative. These data demonstrate that the transcriptional foundations of self-renewal and proliferation are distinct in LSCs as they often are in normal stem cells and suggest that therapeutic strategies that target self-renewal, in addition to proliferation, are critical to prevent relapse and improve survival in AML. SIGNIFICANCE: These findings define and functionally validate a self-renewal gene profile of leukemia stem cells at the single-cell level and demonstrate that self-renewal and proliferation are distinct in AML.

31815677,Effectiveness of Smartphone App-Based Interactive Management on Glycemic Control in Chinese Patients With Poorly Controlled Diabetes: Randomized Controlled Trial.,"BACKGROUND:In recent years, the rapid development of mobile medical technology has provided multiple ways for the long-term management of chronic diseases, especially diabetes. As a new type of management model, smartphone apps are global, convenient, cheap, and interactive. Although apps were proved to be more effective at glycemic control, compared with traditional computer- and Web-based telemedicine technologies, how to gain a further and sustained improvement is still being explored. OBJECTIVE:The objective of this study was to investigate the effectiveness of an app-based interactive management model by a professional health care team on glycemic control in Chinese patients with poorly controlled diabetes. METHODS:This study was a 6-month long, single-center, prospective randomized controlled trial. A total of 276 type 1 or type 2 diabetes patients were enrolled and randomized to the control group (group A), app self-management group (group B), and app interactive management group (group C) in a 1:1:1 ratio. The primary outcome was the change in glycated hemoglobin (HbA1c) level. Missing data were handled by multiple imputation. RESULTS:At months 3 and 6, all 3 groups showed significant decreases in HbA1c levels (all P<.05). Patients in the app interactive management group had a significantly lower HbA1clevel than those in the app self-management group at 6 months (P=.04). The average HbA1c reduction in the app interactive management group was larger than that in the app self-management and control groups at both months 3 and 6 (all P<.05). However, no differences in HbA1c reduction were observed between the app self-management and control groups at both months 3 and 6 (both P>.05). Multivariate line regression analyses also showed that the app interactive management group was associated with the larger reduction of HbA1c compared with groups A and B at both months 3 and 6 (all P>.05). In addition, the app interactive management group had better control of triglyceride and high-density lipoprotein cholesterol levels at both months 3 and 6 compared with baseline (both P<.05). CONCLUSIONS:In Chinese patients with poorly controlled diabetes, it was difficult to achieve long-term effective glucose improvement by using app self-management alone, but combining it with interactive management can help achieve rapid and sustained glycemic control.

This can lead to patient-specific identification of the underlying mechanism of disease thereby improving diagnosis and personalizing treatment. Existing methods rely on external databases to quantify pathway activity scores. This ignores the data dependencies and that pathways are incomplete or condition-specific.<h4>Results</h4>ssNPA is a new approach for subtyping samples based on deregulation of their gene networks. ssNPA learns a causal graph directly from control data. Sample-specific network neighborhood deregulation is quantified via the error incurred in predicting the expression of each gene from its Markov blanket. We evaluate the performance of ssNPA on liver development single-cell RNA-seq data, where the correct cell timing is recovered; and two TCGA datasets, where ssNPA patient clusters have significant survival differences.

31913588,Measuring and optimising the efficiency of community hospital inpatient care for older people: the MoCHA mixed-methods study,"<h4>Background</h4>Community hospitals are small hospitals providing local inpatient and outpatient services. National surveys report that inpatient rehabilitation for older people is a core function but there are large differences in key performance measures. We have investigated these variations in community hospital ward performance.<h4>Objectives</h4>(1) To measure the relative performance of community hospital wards (studies 1 and 2); (2) to identify characteristics of community hospital wards that optimise performance (studies 1 and 3); (3) to develop a web-based interactive toolkit that supports operational changes to optimise ward performance (study 4); (4) to investigate the impact of community hospital wards on secondary care use (study 5); and (5) to investigate associations between short-term community (intermediate care) services and secondary care utilisation (study 5).<h4>Methods</h4>Study 1 � we used national data to conduct econometric estimations using stochastic frontier analysis in which a cost function was modelled using significant predictors of community hospital ward costs. Study 2 � a national postal survey was developed to collect data from a larger sample of community hospitals. Study 3 � three ethnographic case studies were performed to provide insight into less tangible aspects of community hospital ward care. Study 4 � a web-based interactive toolkit was developed by integrating the econometrics (study 1) and case study (study 3) findings. Study 5 � regression analyses were conducted using data from the Atlas of Variation Map 61 (rate of emergency admissions to hospital for people aged = 75 years with a length of stay of < 24 hours) and the National Audit of Intermediate Care.<h4>Results</h4>Community hospital ward efficiency is comparable with the NHS acute hospital sector (mean cost efficiency 0.83, range 0.72�0.92). The rank order of community hospital ward efficiencies was distinguished to facilitate learning across the sector. On average, if all community hospital wards were operating in line with the highest cost efficiency, savings of 17% (or �47M per year) could be achieved (price year 2013/14) for our sample of 101 wards. Significant economies of scale were found: a 1% rise in output was associated with an average 0.85% increase in costs. We were unable to obtain a larger community hospital sample because of the low response rate to our national survey. The case studies identified how rehabilitation was delivered through collaborative, interdisciplinary working; interprofessional communication; and meaningful patient and family engagement. We also developed insight into patients� recovery trajectories and care transitions. The web-based interactive toolkit was established [http://mocha.nhsbenchmarking.nhs.uk/ (accessed 9 September 2019)]. The crisis response team type of intermediate care, but not community hospitals, had a statistically significant negative association with emergency admissions.<h4>Limitations</h4>The econometric analyses were based on cross-sectional data and were also limited by missing data. The low response rate to our national survey means that we cannot extrapolate reliably from our community hospital sample.<h4>Conclusions</h4>The results suggest that significant community hospital ward savings may be realised by improving modifiable performance factors that might be augmented further by economies of scale.<h4>Future work</h4>How less efficient hospitals might reduce costs and sustain quality requires further research.<h4>Funding</h4>This project was funded by the National Institute for Health Research (NIHR) Health Services and Delivery Research programme and will be published in full in Health Services and Delivery Research; Vol. 8, No. 1.

Here, we put 3.5 years of SOCCOM observations into broader context with the global surface carbon dioxide database (Surface Ocean CO2 Atlas, SOCAT) by using the two interpolation methods currently used to assess the ocean models in the Global Carbon Budget (Le Qu�r� et al., 2018, https://doi:10.5194/essd-10-2141-2018) to create a ship-only, a float-weighted, and a combined estimate of Southern Ocean carbon fluxes (<35�S). In our ship-only estimate, we calculate a mean uptake of -1.14 � 0.19 Pg C/yr for 2015-2017, consistent with prior studies. The float-weighted estimate yields a significantly lower Southern Ocean uptake of -0.35 � 0.19 Pg C/yr. Subsampling of high-resolution ocean biogeochemical process models indicates that some of the differences between float and ship-only estimates of the Southern Ocean carbon flux can be explained by spatial and temporal sampling differences. The combined ship and float estimate minimizes the root-mean-square pCO2 difference between the mapped product and both data sets, giving a new Southern Ocean uptake of -0.75 � 0.22 Pg C/yr, though with uncertainties that overlap the ship-only estimate. An atmospheric inversion reveals that a shift of this magnitude in the contemporary Southern Ocean carbon flux must be compensated for by ocean or land sinks within the Southern Hemisphere.","kes, hji",0.0,0,0,2,0.0,,
32043185,Metabolic alterations in immune cells associate with progression to type 1 diabetes.,"<h4>Aims/hypothesis</h4>Previous metabolomics studies suggest that type 1 diabetes is preceded by specific metabolic disturbances. The aim of this study was to investigate whether distinct metabolic patterns occur in peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) of children who later develop pancreatic beta cell autoimmunity or overt type 1 diabetes.<h4>Methods</h4>In a longitudinal cohort setting, PBMC metabolomic analysis was applied in children who (1) progressed to type 1 diabetes (PT1D, n = 34), (2) seroconverted to =1 islet autoantibody without progressing to type 1 diabetes (P1Ab, n = 27) or (3) remained autoantibody negative during follow-up (CTRL, n = 10).<h4>Results</h4>During the first year of life, levels of most lipids and polar metabolites were lower in the PT1D and P1Ab groups compared with the CTRL group. Pathway over-representation analysis suggested alanine, aspartate, glutamate, glycerophospholipid and sphingolipid metabolism were over-represented in PT1D. Genome-scale metabolic models of PBMCs during type 1 diabetes progression were developed by using publicly available transcriptomics data and constrained with metabolomics data from our study. Metabolic modelling confirmed altered ceramide pathways, known to play an important role in immune regulation, as specifically associated with type 1 diabetes progression.<h4>Conclusions/interpretation</h4>Our data suggest that systemic dysregulation of lipid metabolism, as observed in plasma, may impact the metabolism and function of immune cells during progression to overt type 1 diabetes.<h4>Data availability</h4>The GEMs for PBMCs have been submitted to BioModels (www.ebi.ac.uk/biomodels/), under accession number MODEL1905270001. The metabolomics datasets and the clinical metadata generated in this study were submitted to MetaboLights (https://www.ebi.ac.uk/metabolights/), under accession number MTBLS1015.","kes, hji",0.0,0,0,2,0.0,,data deposited as referenced
32078592,"Characteristics and Health Status of Informal Unpaid Caregivers - 44 States, District of Columbia, and Puerto Rico, 2015-2017.","In 2015, an estimated 17.7 million U.S. persons were informal caregivers who provided substantial services through in-home, unpaid assistance to their family members and friends (1). Caregiving can have many benefits, such as enhancing the bond between caregiver and recipient, but it can also place an emotional and physical strain on caregivers, leading to higher rates of depression, lower quality of life, and poorer overall health (2). As the U.S. population continues to age (3), the need for informal caregivers will likely increase. However, little nationally representative information on prevalence of caregivers is available. This study examined demographic characteristics and health status of informal caregivers from 44 states,* the District of Columbia (DC), and Puerto Rico, based on data from the Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System (BRFSS) collected during 2015-2017. Overall, approximately one in five adults reported that they had provided care to a family member or friend in the preceding 30 days. Fifty-eight percent of caregivers were women, and a majority were non-Hispanic white, with at least some college education, and married or living with a partner. Across all states, 19.2% of caregivers reported being in fair or poor health, although significant state-to-state variation occurred. Caregivers provide important support to family members, friends, and the health care system and might compromise their own health to provide this support (1,2). Better understanding of caregivers and the challenges they face could inform implementation of improvements in support systems that could enhance not only the health of the caregiver, but that of the care recipient as well. For example, additional data regarding demographics at the state level might aid in more effective planning and support of caregivers with evidence-based programs and assistance (https://www.cdc.gov/aging/publications/features/caring-for-yourself.html).","kes, hji",0.0,0,0,2,0.0,,public health
32110491,DISNET: a framework for extracting phenotypic disease information from public sources.,"Background:Within the global endeavour of improving population health, one major challenge is the identification and integration of medical knowledge spread through several information sources. The creation of a comprehensive dataset of diseases and their clinical manifestations based on information from public sources is an interesting approach that allows one not only to complement and merge medical knowledge but also to increase it and thereby to interconnect existing data and analyse and relate diseases to each other. In this paper, we present DISNET (http://disnet.ctb.upm.es/), a web-based system designed to periodically extract the knowledge from signs and symptoms retrieved from medical databases, and to enable the creation of customisable disease networks. Methods:We here present the main features of the DISNET system. We describe how information on diseases and their phenotypic manifestations is extracted from Wikipedia and PubMed websites; specifically, texts from these sources are processed through a combination of text mining and natural language processing techniques. Results:We further present the validation of our system on Wikipedia and PubMed texts, obtaining the relevant accuracy. The final output includes the creation of a comprehensive symptoms-disease dataset, shared (free access) through the system's API. We finally describe, with some simple use cases, how a user can interact with it and extract information that could be used for subsequent analyses. Discussion:DISNET allows retrieving knowledge about the signs, symptoms and diagnostic tests associated with a disease. It is not limited to a specific category (all the categories that the selected sources of information offer us) and clinical diagnosis terms. It further allows to track the evolution of those terms through time, being thus an opportunity to analyse and observe the progress of human knowledge on diseases. We further discussed the validation of the system, suggesting that it is good enough to be used to extract diseases and diagnostically-relevant terms. At the same time, the evaluation also revealed that improvements could be introduced to enhance the system's reliability.","kes, hji",0.0,0,0,2,0.0,,"good, but too clinical I think"

32130122,Feasibility of an Electronic Health Tool to Promote Physical Activity in Primary Care: Pilot Cluster Randomized Controlled Trial.,"BACKGROUND:Physical inactivity is associated with increased health risks. Primary care providers (PCPs) are well positioned to support increased physical activity (PA) levels through screening and provision of PA prescriptions. However, PCP counseling on PA is not common. OBJECTIVE:This study aimed to assess the feasibility of implementing an electronic health (eHealth) tool to support PA counseling by PCPs and estimate intervention effectiveness on patients' PA levels. METHODS:A pragmatic pilot study was conducted using a stepped wedge cluster randomized trial design. The study was conducted at a single primary care clinic, with 4 pre-existing PCP teams. Adult patients who had a periodic health review (PHR) scheduled during the study period were invited to participate. The eHealth tool involved an electronic survey sent to participants before their PHR via an email or a tablet; data were used to automatically produce tailored resources and a PA prescription in the electronic medical record of participants in the intervention arm. Participants assigned to the control arm received usual care from their PCP. Feasibility was assessed by the proportion of completed surveys and patient-reported acceptability and fidelity measures. The primary effectiveness outcome was patient-reported PA at 4 months post-PHR, measured as metabolic equivalent of task (MET) minutes per week. Secondary outcomes assessed determinants of PA, including self-efficacy and intention to change based on the Health Action Process Approach behavior change theory. RESULTS:A total of 1028 patients receiving care from 34 PCPs were invited to participate and 530 (51.55%) consented (intervention [n=296] and control [n=234]). Of the participants who completed a process evaluation, almost half (88/178, 49.4%) stated they received a PA prescription, with only 42 receiving the full intervention including tailored resources from their PCP. A cluster-level linear regression analysis yielded a non-statistically significant positive difference in MET-minutes reported per week at follow-up between intervention and control conditions (mean difference 1027; 95% CI -155 to 2209; P=.09). No statistically significant differences were observed for secondary outcomes. CONCLUSIONS:Our results suggest that it is feasible to build an eHealth tool that screens and provides tailored resources for PA in a primary care setting but suboptimal intervention fidelity suggests greater work must be done to address PCP barriers to resource distribution. Participant responses to the primary effectiveness outcome (MET-minutes) were highly variable, reflecting a need for more robust measures of PA in future trials to address limitations in patient-reported data.

32130186,A 21-Day School-Based Toothbrushing Intervention in Children Aged 6 to 9 Years in Indonesia and Nigeria: Protocol for a Two-Arm Superiority Randomized Controlled Trial.,"BACKGROUND:The World Health Organization reports that dental cavities affect 60% to 90% of children globally. FDI World Dental Federation and Unilever Oral Care have developed public health programs to improve brushing habits over their 12-year partnership. The last of these (phase III) named Brush Day & Night aimed to educate children on brushing twice daily with a fluoride toothpaste and gave useful information for a new project, phase IV. The 21-day Brush Day & Night program is an intense education activity designed to establish the habit of brushing day and night with a fluoride toothpaste. The program involves daily brushing instruction and includes free toothpaste and toothbrushes. OBJECTIVE:The main objective of the study is to evaluate the impact of a 21-day school program on children's oral health. As a secondary objective, we aim to evaluate the impact on the knowledge, behavior, toothbrushing habits, and quality of life in school children aged 6 to 9 years after a 21-day school program and compare with baseline and a control group as measured by the self-reported questionnaires issued to children (in particular, the self-reported brushing frequency and positive responses on fluoridated toothpaste use). The enduring nature of the program will be determined by the inclusion of 8- and 24-week time points. METHODS:The study is a 2-arm superiority randomized controlled trial. Clusters in this study are infant and junior schools in Indonesia and Nigeria. The study aims to recruit 20 schools with children aged 6 to 9 years in each country. At baseline, children in both intervention and control schools will answer a questionnaire and have their clinical oral health assessed using the Simplified Oral Hygiene Index (OHI) and Decayed Missing and Filled Teeth index. Children in the intervention schools will then take part in a structured 21-day Brush Day & Night intervention. Children in the control schools will be provided with free toothpaste and toothbrushes but will not receive the 21-day intervention. The questionnaires and OHI assessments are repeated after the 21-day program is completed and again 8 weeks later and 24 weeks later for all participating children. Parents/carers/guardians of all children will sign the informed consent and complete questionnaires on their own experience and attitudes toward oral health and toothbrushing routine at each of the four times points (baseline, 21 days, 8 weeks, and 24 weeks). The study will be conducted by the national dental associations of Indonesia and Nigeria and was approved by the ethics committees of both countries. RESULTS:The study is ongoing. Recruitment of schools started in Indonesia in February 2018 and in Nigeria in April 2018 for the first part of the study, which concluded in Indonesia in September 2018 and in Nigeria in November 2018. The second part of the study (the second half of the schools) started in November 2018 in Indonesia and December 2018 in Nigeria.

32139710,"Classification models for Invasive Ductal Carcinoma Progression, based on gene expression data-trained supervised machine learning.","Early detection of breast cancer and its correct stage determination are important for prognosis and rendering appropriate personalized clinical treatment to breast cancer patients. However, despite considerable efforts and progress, there is a need to identify the specific genomic factors responsible for, or accompanying Invasive Ductal Carcinoma (IDC) progression stages, which can aid the determination of the correct cancer stages. We have developed two-class machine-learning classification models to differentiate the early and late stages of IDC. The prediction models are trained with RNA-seq gene expression profiles representing different IDC stages of 610 patients, obtained from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA). Different supervised learning algorithms were trained and evaluated with an enriched model learning, facilitated by different feature selection methods. We also developed a machine-learning classifier trained on the same datasets with training sets reduced data corresponding to IDC driver genes. Based on these two classifiers, we have developed a web-server Duct-BRCA-CSP to predict early stage from late stages of IDC based on input RNA-seq gene expression profiles. The analysis conducted by us also enables deeper insights into the stage-dependent molecular events accompanying IDC progression.

32150354,Visualizing Human Protein-Protein Interactions and Subcellular Localizations on Cell Images Through CellMap.,"Visualizing protein data remains a challenging and stimulating task. Useful and intuitive visualization tools may help advance biomolecular and medical research; unintuitive tools may bar important breakthroughs. This protocol describes two use cases for the CellMap (http://cellmap.protein.properties) web tool. The tool allows researchers to visualize human protein-protein interaction data constrained by protein subcellular localizations. In the simplest form, proteins are visualized on cell images that also show protein-protein interactions (PPIs) through lines (edges) connecting the proteins across the compartments. At a glance, this simultaneously highlights spatial constraints that proteins are subject to in their physical environment and visualizes PPIs against these localizations. Visualizing two realities helps in decluttering the protein interaction visualization from """"hairball"""" phenomena that arise when single proteins or groups thereof interact with hundreds of partners. � 2019 The Authors.

32166213,Machine learning with force-field inspired descriptors for materials: fast screening and mapping energy landscape.,"We present a complete set of chemo-structural descriptors to significantly extend the applicability of machine-learning (ML) in material screening and mapping energy landscape for multicomponent systems. These new descriptors allow differentiating between structural prototypes, which is not possible using the commonly used chemical-only descriptors. Specifically, we demonstrate that the combination of pairwise radial, nearest neighbor, bond-angle, dihedral-angle and core-charge distributions plays an important role in predicting formation energies, bandgaps, static refractive indices, magnetic properties, and modulus of elasticity for three-dimensional (3D) materials as well as exfoliation energies of two-dimensional (2D) layered materials. The training data consists of 24549 bulk and 616 monolayer materials taken from JARVIS-DFT database. We obtained very accurate ML models using gradient boosting algorithm. Then we use the trained models to discover exfoliable 2D-layered materials satisfying specific property requirements. Additionally, we integrate our formation energy ML model with a genetic algorithm for structure search to verify if the ML model reproduces the DFT convex hull. This verification establishes a more stringent evaluation metric for the ML model than what commonly used in data sciences.

32186404,"Uterine Patterning, Endometrial Gland Development, and Implantation Failure in Mice Exposed Neonatally to Genistein.","BACKGROUND:Embryo implantation relies on precise hormonal regulation, associated gene expression changes, and appropriate female reproductive tract tissue architecture. Female mice exposed neonatally to the phytoestrogen genistein (GEN) at doses similar to those in infants consuming soy-based infant formulas are infertile due in part to uterine implantation defects. OBJECTIVES:Our goal was to determine the mechanisms by which neonatal GEN exposure causes implantation defects. METHODS:Female mice were exposed to GEN on postnatal days (PND)1-5 and uterine tissues collected on PND5, PND22-26, and during pregnancy. Analysis of tissue weights, morphology, and gene expression was performed using standard histology, confocal imaging with three-dimensional analysis, real-time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (real-time RT-PCR), and microarrays. The response of ovariectomized adults to 17�-estradiol (E2) and artificial decidualization were measured. Leukemia inhibitory factor (LIF) injections were given intraperitoneally and implantation sites visualized. Gene expression patterns were compared with curated data sets to identify upstream regulators. RESULTS:GEN-exposed mice exhibited reduced uterine weight gain in response to E2 treatment or artificial decidualization compared with controls; however, expression of select hormone responsive genes remained similar between the two groups. Uteri from pregnant GEN-exposed mice were posteriorized and had reduced glandular epithelium. Implantation failure was not rescued by LIF administration. Microarray analysis of GEN-exposed uteri during early pregnancy revealed significant overlap with several conditional uterine knockout mouse models, including Foxa2, Wnt4, and Sox17. These models exhibit reduced endometrial glands, features of posteriorization and implantation failure. Expression of Foxa2, Wnt4, and Sox17, as well as genes important for neonatal uterine differentiation (Wnt7a, Hoxa10, and Msx2), were severely disrupted on PND5 in GEN-exposed mice. DISCUSSION:Our findings suggest that neonatal GEN exposure in mice disrupts expression of genes important for uterine development, causing posteriorization and diminished gland function during pregnancy that contribute to implantation failure. These findings could have implications for women who consumed soy-based formulas as infants. https://doi.org/10.1289/EHP6336.","kes, hji",0.0,0,0,2,0.0,,
32214380,Stochastic simulation and statistical inference platform for visualization and estimation of transcriptional kinetics.,"Recent advances in single-molecule fluorescent imaging have enabled quantitative measurements of transcription at a single gene copy, yet an accurate understanding of transcriptional kinetics is still lacking due to the difficulty of solving detailed biophysical models. Here we introduce a stochastic simulation and statistical inference platform for modeling detailed transcriptional kinetics in prokaryotic systems, which has not been solved analytically. The model includes stochastic two-state gene activation, mRNA synthesis initiation and stepwise elongation, release to the cytoplasm, and stepwise co-transcriptional degradation. Using the Gillespie algorithm, the platform simulates nascent and mature mRNA kinetics of a single gene copy and predicts fluorescent signals measurable by time-lapse single-cell mRNA imaging, for different experimental conditions. To approach the inverse problem of estimating the kinetic parameters of the model from experimental data, we develop a heuristic optimization method based on the genetic algorithm and the empirical distribution of mRNA generated by simulation. As a demonstration, we show that the optimization algorithm can successfully recover the transcriptional kinetics of simulated and experimental gene expression data.

32266474,Conjunctive reward-place coding properties of dorsal distal CA1 hippocampus cells.,"Autonomous motivated spatial navigation in animals or robots requires the association between spatial location and value. Hippocampal place cells are involved in goal-directed spatial navigation and the consolidation of spatial memories. Recently, Gauthier and Tank (Neuron 99(1):179-193, 2018. https://doi.org/10.1016/j.neuron.2018.06.008) have identified a subpopulation of hippocampal cells selectively activated in relation to rewarded goals. However, the relationship between these cells' spiking activity and goal representation remains elusive. We analyzed data from experiments in which rats underwent five consecutive tasks in which reward locations and spatial context were manipulated. We found CA1 populations with properties continuously ranging from place cells to reward cells. Specifically, we found typical place cells insensitive to reward locations, reward cells that only fired at correct rewarded feeders in each task regardless of context, and """"hybrid cells"""" that responded to spatial locations and change of reward locations. Reward cells responded mostly to the reward delivery rather than to its expectation. In addition, we found a small group of neurons that transitioned between place and reward cells properties within the 5-task session. We conclude that some pyramidal cells (if not all) integrate both spatial and reward inputs to various degrees. These results provide insights into the integrative coding properties of CA1 pyramidal cells, focusing on their abilities to carry both spatial and reward information in a mixed and plastic manner. This conjunctive coding property prompts a re-thinking of current computational models of spatial navigation in which hippocampal spatial and subcortical value representations are independent.","kes, hji",0.0,0,0,2,0.0,,

A healthy lifestyle during pregnancy is also crucial to avoid high post-partum weight retention. Currently, lifestyle changes are not consistently discussed during routine health services in Germany. The objective of this study is to evaluate a novel computer-assisted lifestyle intervention embedded in prenatal visits and infant check-ups. The intervention seeks to reduce lifestyle-related risk factors for overweight and obesity among expecting mothers and their infants. METHODS:The study is designed as a hybrid effectiveness-implementation trial to simultaneously collect data on the effectiveness and implementation of the lifestyle intervention. The trial will take place in eight regions of the German state Baden-Wuerttemberg. Region were matched using propensity score matching. Expecting mothers (n = 1860) will be recruited before 12 weeks of gestation through gynecological practices and followed for 18 months. During 11 routine prenatal visits and infant check-ups gynecologists, midwives and pediatricians provide lifestyle counseling using Motivational Interviewing techniques. The primary outcome measure is the proportion of expecting mothers with gestational weight gain within the recommended range. To understand the process of implementation (focus group) interviews will be conducted with providers and participants of the lifestyle intervention. Additionally, an analysis of administrative data and documents will be carried out. An economic analysis will provide insights into cost and consequences compared to routine health services. DISCUSSION:Findings of this study will add to the evidence on lifestyle interventions to reduce risk for overweight and obesity commenced during pregnancy. Insights gained will contribute to the prevention of early programming of chronic disease. Study results regarding implementation fidelity, adoption, reach and cost-effectiveness of the lifestyle intervention will inform decisions about scale up and public funding.

32391909,Global ocean resistome revealed: Exploring antibiotic resistance gene abundance and distribution in TARA Oceans samples.,"<h4>Background</h4>The rise of antibiotic resistance (AR) in clinical settings is of great concern. Therefore, the understanding of AR mechanisms, evolution, and global distribution is a priority for patient survival. Despite all efforts in the elucidation of AR mechanisms in clinical strains, little is known about its prevalence and evolution in environmental microorganisms. We used 293 metagenomic samples from the TARA Oceans project to detect and quantify environmental antibiotic resistance genes (ARGs) using machine learning tools.<h4>Results</h4>After manual curation of ARGs, their abundance and distribution in the global ocean are presented. Additionally, the potential of horizontal ARG transfer by plasmids and their correlation with environmental and geographical parameters is shown. A total of 99,205 environmental open reading frames (ORFs) were classified as 1 of 560 different ARGs conferring resistance to 26 antibiotic classes. We found 24,567 ORFs in putative plasmid sequences, suggesting the importance of mobile genetic elements in the dynamics of environmental ARG transmission. Moreover, 4,804 contigs with >=2 putative ARGs were found, including 2 plasmid-like contigs with 5 different ARGs, highlighting the potential presence of multi-resistant microorganisms in the natural ocean environment. Finally, we identified ARGs conferring resistance to some of the most relevant clinical antibiotics, revealing the presence of 15 ARGs similar to mobilized colistin resistance genes (mcr) with high abundance on polar biomes. Of these, 5 are assigned to Psychrobacter, a genus including opportunistic human pathogens.<h4>Conclusions</h4>This study uncovers the diversity and abundance of ARGs in the global ocean metagenome. Our results are available on Zenodo in MySQL database dump format, and all the code used for the analyses, including a Jupyter notebook js avaliable on Github. We also developed a dashboard web application (http://www.resistomedb.com) for data visualization.","kes, hji",0.0,0,0,2,0.0,,data deposited as referenced
32419835,Integrated Analysis of the Mechanisms of Da-Chai-Hu Decoction in Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus by a Network Pharmacology Approach.,"Background:The incidence of type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) has increased year by year, which not only seriously affects people's quality of life, but also imposes a heavy economic burden on the family, society, and country. Currently, the pathogenesis, diagnosis, and treatment of T2DM are still unclear. Therefore, exploration of a precise multitarget treatment strategy is urgent. Here, we attempt to screen out the active components, effective targets, and functional pathways of therapeutic drugs through network pharmacology with taking advantages of traditional Chinese medicine (TCM) formulas for multitarget holistic treatment of diseases to clarify the potential therapeutic mechanism of TCM formulas and provide a systematic and clear thought for T2DM treatment. Methods:First, we screened the active components of Da-Chai-Hu Decoction (DCHD) by absorption, distribution, metabolism, excretion, and toxicity (ADME/T) calculation. Second, we predicted and screened the active components of DCHD and its therapeutic targets for T2DM relying on the Traditional Chinese Medicine Systems Pharmacology Analysis Platform (TCMSP database) and Text Mining Tool (GoPubMed database), while using the Database for Annotation, Visualization, and Integrated Discovery (DAVID) to obtain T2DM targets. Third, we constructed a network of the active component-target, target-pathway of DCHD using Cytoscape software (http://cytoscape.org/,ver.3.5.1) and then analyzed gene function, related biological processes, and signal pathways through the DAVID database. Results:We screened 77 active components from 1278 DCHD components and 116 effective targets from 253 ones. After matching the targets of T2DM, we obtained 38 important targets and 7 core targets were selected through further analysis. Through enrichment analysis, we found that these important targets were mainly involved in many biological processes such as oxidative stress, inflammatory reaction, and apoptosis. After analyzing the relevant pathways, the synthetic pathway for the treatment of T2DM was obtained, which provided a diagnosis-treatment idea for DCHD in the treatment of T2DM. Conclusions:This article reveals the mechanism of DCHD in the treatment of T2DM related to inflammatory response and apoptosis through network pharmacology, which lays a foundation for further elucidation of drugs effective targets.","kes, hji",0.0,0,0,2,0.0,,

32519765,A novel nonsense mutation of ZEB2 gene in a Chinese patient with Mowat-Wilson syndrome.,"<h4>Background</h4>Mowat-Wilson syndrome (MWS) is a rare genetic disorder characterized by intellectual disability, distinctive facial features, and multiple anomalies caused by haploinsufficiency of�the ZEB2�gene. We investigated the genetic causes of MWS in a 14-year-old girl who had characteristic features of MWS.<h4>Methods</h4>Clinical data and peripheral blood DNA samples were collected from the proband. Following extraction of genomic DNA, whole-exome sequencing was conducted to detect genetic variants. Bioinformatics�analysis was�carried�out�to predict�the�function of the mutant gene.<h4>Results</h4>Mutation analysis of the proband identified a novel nonsense mutation (c.250G�>�T, p.E84*) within exon 3 of the�ZEB2�gene. This novel alteration resulted in a termination codon at amino acid position 84, which was predicted to encode a truncated protein. This variant was not present in unrelated healthy control samples that were obtained from the exome sequence databases ExAc browser (http://exac.broadinstitute.org/) and gnomAD browser (http://gnomad.broadinstitute.org/). It is a novel variant that was determined to be a deleterious mutation according to the variant interpretation guidelines of the ACMG. The results of our study suggest that the p.E84* mutation in the�ZEB2�gene was probably the pathogenic mutation that caused MWS in the proband.<h4>Conclusions</h4>This study reports the novel mutation in the proband will provide a basic foundation for further investigations to elucidate the ZEB2-related mechanisms of MWS.","kes, hji",0.0,0,0,2,0.0,,

32541556,Interactive Web Application for Plotting Personalized Prognosis Prediction Curves in Allogeneic Hematopoietic Cell Transplantation Using Machine Learning.,"<h4>Background</h4>Allogeneic hematopoietic cell transplantation (allo-HCT) is a curative treatment option for malignant hematological disorders. Transplant clinicians estimate patient-specific prognosis empirically in clinical practice based on previous studies on similar patients. However, this approach does not provide objective data. The present study primarily aimed to develop a tool capable of providing accurate personalized prognosis prediction after allo-HCT in an objective manner.<h4>Methods</h4>We developed an interactive web application tool with a graphical user interface capable of plotting the personalized survival and cumulative incidence prediction curves after allo-HCT adjusted by 8 patient-specific factors, which are known as prognostic predictors, and assessed their predictive performances. A random survival forest model using the data of patients who underwent allo-HCT at our institution was applied to develop this application.<h4>Results</h4>We succeeded in showing the personalized prognosis prediction curves of 1-year overall survival, progression-free survival, relapse/progression, and nonrelapse mortality (NRM) interactively using our web application (https://predicted-os-after-transplantation.shinyapps.io/RSF_model/). To assess its predictive performance, the entire cohort (363 cases) was split into a training cohort (70%) and a test cohort (30%) time-sequentially based on the patients' transplant dates. The areas under the receiver-operating characteristic curves for 1-year overall survival, progression-free survival, relapse/progression, and nonrelapse mortality in test cohort were 0.70, 0.72, 0.73, and 0.77, respectively.<h4>Conclusions</h4>The new web application could allow transplant clinicians to inform a new allo-HCT candidate of the objective personalized prognosis prediction and facilitate decision-making.","kes, hji",0.0,0,0,2,0.0,,
32546899,Hypersensitivity reactions to biologics (part I): allergy as an important differential diagnosis in complex immune-derived adverse events.,"<b>Purpose:</b> Biotechnological substances (BSs) are strongly relied upon to prevent rejection of transplanted organs, and to treat oncological, allergological, and other inflammatory diseases. Allergic reactions to partly foreign biologics can occur due to their potential immunogenicity. The severity of an immune response to a biological drug may range from no clinical significance to a severe, life-threatening anaphylactic reaction.<b>Methods:</b> Detailed searches were performed on Pubmed, Web of Science, and Google Scholar to include all available publications. In addition, the Food and Drug Administration, the European Medicines Agency, and British Columbia Cancer Agency Drug Manual databases were screened for hypersensitivity reaction (HSR), infusion reaction, injection site reaction, urticaria, and anaphylaxis for individual BSs.<b>Results:</b> Treatment with BSs can cause various types of HSR. These are mentioned in the literature with definitions such as allergic reactions, anaphylactoid reactions, anaphylaxis, HSR, infusion reactions, injection site reactions, cytokine release syndrome, and urticaria. Due to the overlap in signs and symptoms in the reported descriptions, it is not always possible to differentiate these reactions properly according to their pathomechanism. Similarly, many data reported as anaphylaxis actually describe severe anaphylactic reactions (grades III or IV).<b>Conclusion:</b> There is an urgent need for a simpler symptom- or system-based classification and scoring system to create an awareness for HSRs to BSs. A better understanding of the pathophysiology of HSRs and increased clinical experience in the treatment of side effects will provide timely control of unexpected reactions. As a result, immunotherapy with BSs will become safer in the future.<b>Cite this as G�lsen A</b>, <b>Wedi B</b>, <b>Jappe U.

We used a geographic information system analysis to estimate the annual average satellite-derived PM2.5 concentration for the geocoded location of the participants' baseline residences. Poor cognitive function was defined as a score of less than 18 on the Chinese version of the Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE). Competing risk models were performed to explore the association of PM2.5 with poor cognitive function.<h4>Results</h4>Each 10-�g/m3 increase in PM2.5 was associated with a 5.1% increased risk of poor cognitive function [adjusted hazard ratio (HR): 1.051; 95% confidence interval (CI): 1.023, 1.079]. Compared to the lowest quartile of PM2.5 (<41.4 �g/m3), adjusted HR values were 1.20 (95% CI: 1.09, 1.33), 1.27 (95% CI: 1.15, 1.41), and 1.21 (95% CI: 1.09, 1.34) for the second (=41.4-50.3 ug/m3), third (=50.3-60.7�g/m3), and fourth (=60.7 �g/m3) quartiles of PM2.5, respectively (<i>p</i> for trend <0.001). Subgroup analyses suggested stronger associations between PM2.5 and poor cognitive impairment in men than women. The association was positive in the 65- to 79- and =100-y age group but not significant and positive in the other two age groups with similar results.<h4>Conclusion</h4>PM2.5 was identified as a risk factor for poor cognitive function in Chinese older adults. Improving air quality may reduce the future population burden of poor cognitive function, especially in areas with high air pollution. https://doi.org/10.1289/EHP5304.","kes, hji",0.0,0,0,2,0.0,,
32626466,Application of data science in risk assessment and early warning.,"The food supply chain has been recognised by the EU as a critical infrastructure, and its complexity is the main cause of vulnerability. Depending on the food matrix, natural and/or deliberate contamination, food-borne diseases or even food fraud incidents may occur worldwide. Consequently, robust predictive models and/or software tools are needed to support decision-making and mitigating risks in an efficient and timely manner. In this frame, the fellow participated in data collection and analysis tasks, so as to provide additional predictive models.

32645039,"UFO: A tool for unifying biomedical ontology-based semantic similarity calculation, enrichment analysis and visualization.","<h4>Background</h4>Biomedical ontologies have been growing quickly and proven to be useful in many biomedical applications. Important applications of those data include estimating the functional similarity between ontology terms and between annotated biomedical entities, analyzing enrichment for a set of biomedical entities. Many semantic similarity calculation and enrichment analysis methods have been proposed for such applications. Also, a number of tools implementing the methods have been developed on different platforms. However, these tools have implemented a small number of the semantic similarity calculation and enrichment analysis methods for a certain type of biomedical ontology. Note that the methods can be applied to all types of biomedical ontologies. More importantly, each method can be dominant in different applications; thus, users have more choice with more number of methods implemented in tools. Also, more functions would facilitate their task with ontology.<h4>Results</h4>In this study, we developed a Cytoscape app, named UFO, which unifies most of the semantic similarity measures for between-term and between-entity similarity calculation for all types of biomedical ontologies in OBO format. Based on the similarity calculation, UFO can calculate the similarity between two sets of entities and weigh imported entity networks as well as generate functional similarity networks. Besides, it can perform enrichment analysis of a set of entities by different methods. Moreover, UFO can visualize structural relationships between ontology terms, annotating relationships between entities and terms, and functional similarity between entities. Finally, we demonstrated the ability of UFO through some case studies on finding the best semantic similarity measures for assessing the similarity between human disease phenotypes, constructing biomedical entity functional similarity networks for predicting disease-associated biomarkers, and performing enrichment analysis on a set of similar phenotypes.<h4>Conclusions</h4>Taken together, UFO is expected to be a tool where biomedical ontologies can be exploited for various biomedical applications.<h4>Availability</h4>UFO is distributed as a Cytoscape app, and can be downloaded freely at Cytoscape App (http://apps.cytoscape.org/apps/ufo) for non-commercial use.","kes, hji",0.0,0,0,2,0.0,,
32685640,Lipid profile dataset of optogenetics induced optic nerve regeneration.,"The optic nerve transfers visual information from the retina to the brain through the axons of retinal ganglion cells (RGCs). In adult mammals, optic nerve injuries and progressive degenerative diseases lead to the irreversible loss of RGCs, resulting in vision loss and blindness. Optogenetic models have proved useful in manipulating the growth of RGCs through expression and stimulation of channelrhodopsins (Chr2) in RGCs using the RGC-specific thy-1 promoter. Using transgenic Chr2 mouse (Thy1-ChR2-EYFP) as a model of regeneration, we profile the lipid changes which occur after traumatic optic nerve crush, light stimulation and forced RGC axonal growth. Thy1-ChR2-EYFP and control (C57BL/6) mice were divided in four groups each - 1) no crush and no stimulation, 2) no crush with stimulation, 3) crush and without stimulation, and 4) crush with stimulation. After euthanasia, the optic nerves were collected for lipidomic analysis. The Bligh and Dyer method was used for lipid extraction, followed by mass spectrometry lipid profiling with a Q-Exactive Orbitrap Liquid Chromatography-Mass Spectrometer (LC MS-MS).

32713858,PRIGSA2: Improved version of protein repeat identification by graph spectral analysis.,"Tandemly repeated structural motifs in proteins form highly stable structural folds and provide multiple binding sites associated with diverse functional roles. The tertiary structure and function of these proteins are determined by the type and copy number of the repeating units. Each repeat type exhibits a unique pattern of intra- and inter-repeat unit interactions that is well-captured by the topological features in the network representation of protein structures. Here we present an improved version of our graph based algorithm, PRIGSA, with structure-based validation and filtering steps incorporated for accurate detection of tandem structural repeats. The algorithm integrates available knowledge on repeat families with de novo prediction to detect repeats in single monomer chains as well as in multimeric protein complexes. Three levels of performance evaluation are presented: comparison with state-of-the-art algorithms on benchmark dataset of repeat and nonrepeat proteins, accuracy in the detection of members of 13 known repeat families reported in UniProt and execution on the complete Protein Data Bank to show its ability to identify previously uncharacterized proteins. A ~3-fold increase in the coverage of the members of 13 known families and 3408 novel uncharacterized structural repeat proteins are identified on executing it on PDB.

32811511,Advancing brain barriers RNA sequencing: guidelines from experimental design to publication.,"<h4>Background</h4>RNA sequencing (RNA-Seq) in its varied forms has become an indispensable tool for analyzing differential gene expression and thus characterization of specific tissues. Aiming to understand the brain barriers genetic signature, RNA seq has also been introduced in brain barriers research. This has led to availability of both, bulk and single-cell RNA-Seq datasets over the last few years. If appropriately performed, the RNA-Seq studies provide powerful datasets that allow for significant deepening of knowledge on the molecular mechanisms that establish the brain barriers. However, RNA-Seq studies comprise complex workflows that require to consider many options and variables before, during and after the proper sequencing process.<h4>Main body</h4>In the current manuscript, we build on the interdisciplinary experience of the European PhD Training Network BtRAIN ( https://www.btrain-2020.eu/ ) where bioinformaticians and brain barriers researchers collaborated to analyze and establish RNA-Seq datasets on vertebrate brain barriers. The obstacles BtRAIN has identified in this process have been integrated into the present manuscript. It provides guidelines along the entire workflow of brain barriers RNA-Seq studies starting from the overall experimental design to interpretation of results. Focusing on the vertebrate endothelial blood-brain barrier (BBB) and epithelial blood-cerebrospinal-fluid barrier (BCSFB) of the choroid plexus, we provide a step-by-step description of the workflow, highlighting the decisions to be made at each step of the workflow and explaining the strengths and weaknesses of individual choices made. Finally, we propose recommendations for accurate data interpretation and on the information to be included into a publication to ensure appropriate accessibility of the data and reproducibility of the observations by the scientific community.<h4>Conclusion</h4>Next generation transcriptomic profiling of the brain barriers provides a novel resource for understanding the development, function and pathology of these barrier cells, which is essential for understanding CNS homeostasis and disease. Continuous advancement and sophistication of RNA-Seq will require interdisciplinary approaches between brain barrier researchers and bioinformaticians as successfully performed in BtRAIN. The present guidelines are built on the BtRAIN interdisciplinary experience and aim to facilitate collaboration of brain barriers researchers with bioinformaticians to advance RNA-Seq study design in the brain barriers community.","kes, hji",0.0,0,0,2,0.0,,
32881514,Robust Accurate Identification and Biomass Estimates of Microorganisms via Tandem Mass Spectrometry.,"Rapid and accurate identification of microorganisms and estimation of their biomasses are of extreme importance to public health. Mass spectrometry has become an important technique for these purposes. Previously we published a workflow named <i>Mi</i>croorganism <i>C</i>lassification and <i>Id</i>entification (MiCId v.12.26.2017) that was shown to perform no worse than other workflows. This manuscript presents MiCId v.12.13.2018 that, in comparison with the earlier version v.12.26.2017, allows for biomass estimates, provides more accurate microorganism identifications (better controls the number of false positives), and is robust against database size increase. This significant advance is made possible by several new ingredients introduced: first, we apply a modified expectation-maximization method to compute for each taxon considered a prior probability, which can be used for biomass estimate; second, we introduce a new concept called ownership, through which the participation ratio is computed and use it as the number of taxa to be kept within a cluster of closely related taxa; third, based on confidently identified peptides, we calculate for each taxon its degree of independence from the rest of taxa considered to determine whether or not to split this taxon off the cluster. Using 270 data files, each containing a large number of MS/MS spectra, we show that, in comparison with v.12.26.2017, version v.12.13.2018 yields superior retrieval results. We also show that MiCId v.12.13.2018 can estimate species biomass reasonably well.

Due to a lack of proven treatments, it is critical to explore novel treatments for HE and PHE to improve functional recovery after sICH.<h4>Methods</h4>This is a prospective, multicenter, placebo-controlled, double-blind, and randomized clinical study of approximately 2400 patients with sICH. Patients within 4.5�h of sICH onset that fulfilling the clinical criteria for diagnosis (e.g. age more than 18 years old, the Glasgow Coma Scal>7, and no planned surgery) will randomly receive either intravenous tranexamic acid (TXA) 1 g 10-min bolus followed by 1�g eight-hour infusion or placebo (sodium chloride 0.9%). Clinical data including the ICH score and the Glasgow Coma Scale score will be collected on admission. After assessment of HE and PHE expansion, follow-up will be conducted with enrolled patients for 90 days.<h4>Results</h4>Primary outcome metrics are HE (defined as either >33% or >6�ml increase from baseline) and PHE expansion rate at 24 � 3�h and 72 � 3�h post-sICH. Secondary outcome metrics include mortality and the modified Rankin Scale on day 90 after sICH. Appropriate statistic methods will be used to evaluate the efficacy of TXA on patients with sICH within 4.5�h of symptom onset.<h4>Conclusions</h4>HE usually occurs within the first few hours after onset of symptoms. It is essential to evaluate the efficacy of TXA on HE within a narrow window of time. This will be the first trial to evaluate the efficacy of TXA on HE and PHE expansion in sICH patients within 4.5�h after symptom onset.

32964354,A novel online calculator predicting short-term postoperative outcomes in patients with metastatic brain tumors.,"<h4>Purpose</h4>Establishing predictors of hospital length of stay (LOS), discharge deposition, and total hospital charges is essential to providing high-quality, value-based care. Though previous research has investigated these outcomes for patients with metastatic brain tumors, there are currently no tools that synthesize such research findings and allow for prediction of these outcomes on a patient-by-patient basis. The present study sought to develop a prediction calculator that uses patient demographic and clinical information to predict extended hospital length of stay, non-routine discharge disposition, and high total hospital charges for patients with metastatic brain tumors.<h4>Methods</h4>Patients undergoing surgery for metastatic brain tumors at a single academic institution were analyzed (2017-2019). Multivariate logistic regression was used to identify independent predictors of extended LOS (> 7�days), non-routine discharge, and high total hospital charges (> $�46,082.63). p < 0.05 was considered statistically significant. C-statistics and the Hosmer-Lemeshow test were used to assess model discrimination and calibration, respectively.<h4>Results</h4>A total of 235 patients were included in our analysis, with a mean age of 62.74�years. The majority of patients were female (52.3%) and Caucasian (76.6%). Our models predicting extended LOS, non-routine discharge, and high hospital charges had optimism-corrected c-statistics > 0.7, and all three models demonstrated adequate calibration (p > 0.05). The final models are available as an online calculator ( https://neurooncsurgery.shinyapps.io/brain_mets_calculator/ ).<h4>Conclusions</h4>Our models predicting postoperative outcomes allow for individualized risk-estimation for patients following surgery for metastatic brain tumors. Our results may be useful in helping clinicians to provide resource-conscious, high-value care.","kes, hji",0.0,0,0,2,0.0,,

The correct sentence should have read as follows: """"(b) direct assessments of strength of faith or positive impression management were not included or measured independently."""" All versions of this article have been corrected. (The following abstract of the original article appeared in record 2020-54974-001.) The traditional background hypothesis (TBH) is a long-standing belief associated with the Minnesota Multiphasic Personality Inventory (MMPI) L scale; a validity scale, which appears on every version of the family of MMPI instruments including the soon-to-be released MMPI-3. The L scale was originally designed to assess whether test respondents presented themselves in an unrealistically favorable light. Both researchers and clinicians noted, however, that those from traditional Christian faith-based groups produced elevated L-scale scores. A recent meta-analysis supported this observation, reporting an average L-scale elevation 0.50 SD greater than the MMPI-2 normative sample compared to samples of those with presumptively strong Christian-Judeo faith. Some limitations of this meta-analysis are that (a) the samples used in it included those undergoing an evaluative assessment, which could elevate L-scale scores independent of strength of faith belief, and (b) direct assessments of strength of faith or positive impression management were included or measured independently. Our primary goal in this study was to examine the TBH addressing these limitations with a sample of those who self-identified as believers in the Muslim faith (N = 267), the examination of which expands the scope beyond those of the Christian-Judeo faith. Consistent with previous results, the mean L-r (MMPI/MMPI-2 L scale counterpart on the MMPI-2-Restructured Form) was 56.41 T. Higher L-r scale scores were associated with increasing strength in the Muslim faith, and although increasing L-r scores were primarily associated with impression management, increasing Muslim-based faith values had a nontrivial influence on L-r scores and especially in the moderate score range of this scale.

This study investigated the functional reorganization and its structural base after BCI-guided robot-assisted training using resting-state fMRI, task-based fMRI, and diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) data. The clinical improvement and the neurological changes before, immediately after, and six months after 20-session BCI-guided robot hand training were explored in 14 chronic stroke subjects. The structural base of the induced functional reorganization and motor improvement were also investigated using DTI. Repeated measure ANOVA indicated long-term motor improvement was found (F[2, 26] = 6.367, p = 0.006). Significantly modulated functional connectivity (FC) was observed between ipsilesional motor regions (M1 and SMA) and some contralesional areas (SMA, PMd, SPL) in the seed-based analysis. Modulated FC with ipsilesional M1 was significantly correlated with motor function improvement (r = 0.6455, p = 0.0276). Besides, increased interhemispheric FC among the sensorimotor area from resting-state data and increased laterality index from task-based data together indicated the re-balance of the two hemispheres during the recovery. Multiple linear regression models suggested that both motor function improvement and the functional change between ipsilesional M1 and contralesional premotor area were significantly associated with the ipsilesional corticospinal tract integrity. The results in the current study provided solid support for stroke recovery mechanism in terms of interhemispheric interaction and its structural substrates, which could further enhance the understanding of BCI training in stroke rehabilitation.

33058887,How the CORAL software can be used to select compounds for efficient treatment of neurodegenerative diseases?,"Recommendations on the efficient application of CORAL software (http://www.insilico.eu/coral) to establish quantitative structure-property/activity relationships (QSPRs/QSARs) are provided. The predictive potential of the approach has been demonstrated for QSAR models developed for inhibitor concentrations (negative decimal logarithm of IC50) of derivatives of N-methyl-d-aspartate (NMDA) receptor, leucine-rich repeat kinase 2 (LRRK2), and tropomyosin receptor kinase A (TrkA). The above three protein targets are related to various neurodegenerative diseases such as Alzheimer's and Parkinson's. Each model was checked using several splits of the data for the training and the validation sets. The index of ideality of correlation (IIC) represents a tool to improve the predictive potential for an arbitrary model. However, the use of the IIC should be carried out according to rules, described in this work.","kes, hji",0.0,0,0,2,0.0,,
33064603,Exploring Sentence Diversity at the Boundary of Typical and Impaired Language Abilities.,"Purpose This review article summarizes programmatic research on sentence diversity in toddlers developing language typically and explores developmental patterns of sentence diversity in toddlers at risk for specific language impairment. Method The first half of this review article presents a sentence-focused approach to language assessment and intervention and reviews findings from empirical studies of sentence diversity. In the second half, subject and verb diversity in three simple sentence types are explored in an archival database of toddlers with varying levels of grammatical outcomes at 36 months of age: low average, mild/moderate delay, and severe delay. Results Descriptive findings from the archival database replicated previous developmental patterns. All toddlers with low-average language abilities produced diverse simple sentences by 30 months of age and exhibited greater sentence diversity with first-person <i>I</i>-subjects before third-person subjects. Third-person subject diversity emerged in a developmental sequence, increasing in one-argument copula contexts and one-argument subject-verb sentences before two-argument subject-verb-object sentences. This developmental pattern held across all three outcome groups. Third-person subjects were least diverse for children with severe grammatical delays and were absent in all sentence contexts for two children with severe delays at 36 months. Conclusions Sentence diversity increases gradually and expands in predictable patterns. Understanding these developmental patterns may help identify and treat children who display unexpected difficulty combining different subjects and verbs in flexible ways.

33190499,LigMate: A Multifeature Integration Algorithm for Ligand-Similarity-Based Virtual Screening.,"Ligand-similarity-based virtual screening is one of the most applicable computer-aided drug design techniques. The current methodology relies heavily on several descriptors of molecular features, including atoms (zero-dimensional, 0D), the presence or absence of structural features (one-dimensional, 1D), topological descriptors (two-dimensional, 2D), geometry and volume (three-dimensional, 3D), or stereoelectronic and stereodynamic properties (four-dimensional, 4D). These descriptors have been frequently used in virtual screening; however, they are usually used independently without integration, which may hinder effective and precise virtual screening. In this study, we developed a multifeature integration algorithm named LigMate, which employs a Hungarian algorithm-based matching and a machine learning-based nonlinear combination of various descriptors, including the new relevant descriptors focusing on the maximum common substructures (maximum common substructure score, MCSS), the relative distance of atoms from the ligand mass center (intraligand distance score, ILDS), as well as the ring differences (ring score, RS). In the benchmark tests, LigMate achieved an overall enrichment factor of the first percent (EF1) of 36.14 and an area under the curve (AUC) value of 0.81 on the DUD-E data set, as well as an EF1 of 15.44 and an AUC of 0.69 on the maximum unbiased validation (MUV) data set, outperforming the control methods that are based on single descriptors. Thus, our study provides a new framework for multiple feature integration, which can benefit ligand-similarity-based virtual screening.

33201237,AlgPred 2.0: an improved method for predicting allergenic proteins and mapping of IgE epitopes.,"AlgPred 2.0 is a web server developed for predicting allergenic proteins and allergenic regions in a protein. It is an updated version of AlgPred developed in 2006. The dataset used for training, testing and validation consists of 10�075 allergens and 10�075 non-allergens. In addition, 10�451 experimentally validated immunoglobulin E (IgE) epitopes were used to identify antigenic regions in a protein. All models were trained on 80% of data called training dataset, and the performance of models was evaluated using 5-fold cross-validation technique. The performance of the final model trained on the training dataset was evaluated on 20% of data called validation dataset; no two proteins in any two sets have more than 40% similarity. First, a Basic Local Alignment Search Tool (BLAST) search has been performed against the dataset, and allergens were predicted based on the level of similarity with known allergens. Second, IgE epitopes obtained from the IEDB database were searched in the dataset to predict allergens based on their presence in a protein. Third, motif-based approaches like multiple EM for motif elicitation/motif alignment and search tool have been used to predict allergens. Fourth, allergen prediction models have been developed using a wide range of machine learning techniques. Finally, the ensemble approach has been used for predicting allergenic protein by combining prediction scores of different approaches. Our best model achieved maximum performance in terms of area under receiver operating characteristic curve 0.98 with Matthew's correlation coefficient 0.85 on the validation dataset. A web server AlgPred 2.0 has been developed that allows the prediction of allergens, mapping of IgE epitope, motif search and BLAST search (https://webs.iiitd.edu.in/raghava/algpred2/).","kes, hji",0.0,0,0,2,0.0,,"tool only , I think"
33244798,Comparing the motivational value of rewards and losses in an EEG-pupillometry study.,"We found earlier that performance-contingent rewards lead to faster performance than equivalent losses [Carsten, Hoofs, Boehler, & Krebs, 2019. Motivation Science, 5(3). http://dx.doi.org/10.1037/mot0000117]. Here, we further tested the hypothesis that motivation to gain rewards is higher than to avoid losses, even when incentive values are matched. As implicit markers of motivation, we assessed electroencephalography (EEG) focusing on the P3 after target and feedback onset, and the Feedback-Related Negativity (FRN), as well as simultaneously recorded pupil size. Comparing only reward and loss prospect trials in Experiment 1, we found no consistent differences in behavior and electrophysiological markers of motivation, although pupil data suggested higher arousal after feedback in potential-loss trials. Including additional no-incentive trials in Experiment 2, we found consistent evidence that motivation to gain rewards was higher than to avoid losses: In line with behavior, the target-P3 was most pronounced for reward-related stimuli, followed by loss and no-incentive ones. This same ranking was found in the P3 and the FRN after positive outcomes (i.e., reward, avoided loss, and correct feedback in no-incentive trials). Negative outcomes featured a different pattern in line with the pupil response, which suggests that losses are emotionally salient events, without invigorating behavior proportionally. In sum, these findings suggest that the motivation to gain rewards is more pronounced than motivation to avoid equivalent losses, at least in tasks promoting transient increases in attention triggered by incentive prospect. These motivational differences may arise as avoided losses are not profitable in the long term, in contrast to gained rewards.","kes, hji",0.0,0,0,2,0.0,,
33295914,iDHS-DASTS: identifying DNase I hypersensitive sites based on LASSO and stacking learning.,"The DNase I hypersensitivity site is an important marker of the DNA regulatory region, and its identification in the DNA sequence is of great significance for biomedical research. However, traditional identification methods are extremely time-consuming and can not obtain an accurate result. In this paper, we proposed a predictor called iDHS-DASTS to identify the DHS based on benchmark datasets. First, we adopt a feature extraction method called PseDNC which can incorporate the original DNA properties and spatial information of the DNA sequence. Then we use a method called LASSO to reduce the dimensions of the original data. Finally, we utilize stacking learning as a classifier, which includes Adaboost, random forest, gradient boosting, extra trees and SVM. Before we train the classifier, we use SMOTE-Tomek to overcome the imbalance of the datasets. In the experiment, our iDHS-DASTS achieves remarkable performance on three benchmark datasets. We achieve state-of-the-art results with over 92.06%, 91.06% and 90.72% accuracy for datasets [Doublestruck S]1, [Doublestruck S]2 and [Doublestruck S]3, respectively. To verify the validation and transferability of our model, we establish another independent dataset [Doublestruck S]4, for which the accuracy can reach 90.31%. Furthermore, we used the proposed model to construct a user friendly web server called iDHS-DASTS, which is available at http://www.xdu-duan.cn/.","kes, hji",0.0,0,0,2,0.0,,
33355345,Congress of Neurological Surgeons Systematic Review and Evidence-Based Guideline on Neuroablative Procedures for Patients With Cancer Pain.,"<h4>Background</h4>Managing cancer pain once it is refractory to conventional treatment continues to challenge caregivers committed to serving those who are suffering from a malignancy. Although neuromodulation has a role in the treatment of cancer pain for some patients, these therapies may not be suitable for all patients. Therefore, neuroablative procedures, which were once a mainstay in treating intractable cancer pain, are again on the rise. This guideline serves as a systematic review of the literature of the outcomes following neuroablative procedures.<h4>Objective</h4>To establish clinical practice guidelines for the use of neuroablative procedures to treat patients with cancer pain.<h4>Methods</h4>A systematic review of neuroablative procedures used to treat patients with cancer pain from 1980 to April 2019 was performed using the United States National Library of Medicine PubMed database, EMBASE, and Cochrane CENTRAL. After inclusion criteria were established, full text articles that met the inclusion criteria were reviewed by 2 members of the task force and the quality of the evidence was graded.<h4>Results</h4>In total, 14 646 relevant abstracts were identified by the literature search, from which 189 met initial screening criteria. After full text review, 58 of the 189 articles were included and subdivided into 4 different clinical scenarios. These include unilateral somatic nociceptive/neuropathic body cancer pain, craniofacial cancer pain, midline subdiaphragmatic visceral cancer pain, and disseminated cancer pain. Class II and III evidence was available for these 4 clinical scenarios. Level III recommendations were developed for the use of neuroablative procedures to treat patients with cancer pain.<h4>Conclusion</h4>Neuroablative procedures may be an option for treating patients with refractory cancer pain. Serious adverse events were reported in some studies, but were relatively uncommon. Improved imaging, refinements in technique and the availability of new lesioning modalities may minimize the risks of neuroablation even further.The full guidelines can be accessed at https://www.cns.org/guidelines/browse-guidelines-detail/guidelines-on-neuroablative-procedures-patients-wi.","kes, hji",0.0,0,0,2,0.0,,
33381851,Dementia key gene identification with multi-layered SNP-gene-disease network.,"<h4>Motivation</h4>Recently, various approaches for diagnosing and treating dementia have received significant attention, especially in identifying key genes that are crucial for dementia. If the mutations of such key genes could be tracked, it would be possible to predict the time of onset of dementia and significantly aid in developing drugs to treat dementia. However, gene finding involves tremendous cost, time and effort. To alleviate these problems, research on utilizing computational biology to decrease the search space of candidate genes is actively conducted.In this study, we propose a framework in which diseases, genes and single-nucleotide polymorphisms are represented by a layered network, and key genes are predicted by a machine learning algorithm. The algorithm utilizes a network-based semi-supervised learning model that can be applied to layered data structures.<h4>Results</h4>The proposed method was applied to a dataset extracted from public databases related to diseases and genes with data collected from 186 patients. A portion of key genes obtained using the proposed method was verified in silico through PubMed literature, and the remaining genes were left as possible candidate genes.<h4>Availability and implementation</h4>The code for the framework will be available at http://www.alphaminers.net/.<h4>Supplementary information</h4>Supplementary data are available at Bioinformatics online.","kes, hji",0.0,0,0,2,0.0,,
33402389,Hypoxia-Induced Suppression of Alternative Splicing of MBD2 Promotes Breast Cancer Metastasis via Activation of FZD1.,"Metastasis is responsible for the majority of breast cancer-related deaths, however, the mechanisms underlying metastasis in this disease remain largely elusive. Here we report that under hypoxic conditions, alternative splicing of MBD2 is suppressed, favoring the production of MBD2a, which facilitates breast cancer metastasis. Specifically, MBD2a promoted, whereas its lesser known short form MBD2c suppressed metastasis. Activation of HIF1 under hypoxia facilitated MBD2a production via repression of SRSF2-mediated alternative splicing. As a result, elevated MBD2a outcompeted MBD2c for binding to promoter CpG islands to activate expression of FZD1, thereby promoting epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition and metastasis. Strikingly, clinical data reveal significantly correlated expression of MBD2a and MBD2c with the invasiveness of malignancy, indicating opposing roles for MBD2 splicing variants in regulating human breast cancer metastasis. Collectively, our findings establish a novel link between MBD2 switching and tumor metastasis and provide a promising therapeutic strategy and predictive biomarkers for hypoxia-driven breast cancer metastasis. SIGNIFICANCE: This study defines the opposing roles and clinical relevance of MBD2a and MBD2c, two MBD2 alternative splicing products, in hypoxia-driven breast cancer metastasis.

33457124,GAPDH and PUM1: Optimal Housekeeping Genes for Quantitative Polymerase Chain Reaction-Based Analysis of Cancer Stem Cells and Epithelial-Mesenchymal Transition Gene Expression in Rectal Tumors.,"Background The overwhelming majority of published articles have taken colon and rectal cancer as a single group, i.e., colorectal cancer, when normalizing gene expression data with housekeeping genes (HKG) in quantitative polymerase chain reaction (qPCR) experiments though there are published reports that suggest the differential expression pattern of genes between the colon and rectal cancer groups and hence the current experiment was�attempted to find out the optimal set of�housekeeping genes from the list of common HKG for rectal tumor gene expression analysis. Methods The expression of five�potential housekeeping genes GAPDH, RPNI, PUM1, B2M, and PMM1�was analyzed through qPCR and Bestkeeper software (http://www.wzw.tum.de/gene-quantification/bestkeeper.html) in 20 stage II-IV rectal cancer samples�to check for uniformity in their expression pattern. Cancer stem cell (CSC) marker ALDH1 and epithelial-mesenchymal transition marker (EMT) markers E cadherin, vimentin, Twist,�and SNAI2 expression were evaluated in conjunction with the two optimal reference genes in�10 rectal cancers as part of validation. Results The standard deviation of the cycle threshold value of GAPDH was found the lowest at 0.65 followed by RPN1 at 0.88, PUM1 at 0.94, PMM1 at 0.94, and B2M at 1.21 when analyzed with BestKeeper software. Using GAPDH and PUM1 as the reference gene for the validation phase, rectal cancer patients with stage�III/IV showed a 4.79-fold change (P=0.006) in ALDH1 expression, and an 11.76-fold change in Twist expression (P=0.003) with respect to stage II rectal tumor when normalized with GAPDH and PUM1. Conclusion GAPDH and PUM1 can be used as an optimal set of housekeeping genes for gene expression-related experiments in rectal tumors. ALDH1 and Twist were found significantly overexpressed in stage III/IV rectal tumors in comparison to stage II rectal cancer. Genes associated with�cancer stem cells and EMT markers could be optimally analyzed by normalizing them with GAPDH and PUM1 as housekeeping genes.","kes, hji",0.0,0,0,2,0.0,,
33533177,Neuroblastoma: The basis for cure in limited-resource settings.,"<h4>Background</h4>Neuroblastoma (NB) contributes the most to the mortality of childhood malignancies worldwide. The disease spectrum is heterogenous and the management complex and costly, especially in advanced disease or disease with adverse biology. In low- and middle-income countries (LMICs) the majority of NB presents in advanced stages. Therefore, with limited resources and poor prognosis the treatment of NB is often not a priority. The aim of the study was to evaluate the research activities and perceptions of the management of NB that determine the research and treatment approaches in LMICs.<h4>Methods</h4>Data were sourced from https://www.clinicaltrials.gov/ identifying NB trials open to LMIC. Abstracts on NB research presented at the International Society for Paediatric Oncology (SIOP) Congresses between 2014 and 2020 were evaluated according to income status. An online survey evaluating medical views on NB in LMICs and the effect on the management was conducted. Descriptive analysis was done. Where appropriate categorical association between covariates was assessed using the Pearson chi-square (<U+03C7><sup>2</sup> ) test or Fishers exact test.<h4>Results</h4>There were 15/562 (2.7%) trials open to LMIC. Only six of 138 (4.3%) LMIC participated in NB trials. Of the 688 abstracts presented between 2014 and 2020 at the SIOP International Congress on NB as primary subject, 297 (42.7%) were from LMICs. Only two were from low-income countries (LICs). Sixty-one countries responded to the NB survey. Positive views towards NB management were present when treatment was based on a national protocol, the availability of trimodal or advanced treatment options were present, and when a balance of metastatic or local disease were treated.<h4>Conclusion</h4>Management of NB in LMICs should include increased advocacy and research as well as implementation of national management strategies.","kes, hji",0.0,0,0,2,0.0,,
33544274,The Characterization of Sex Differences in Hypoglycemia-Induced Activation of HPA Axis on the Transcriptomic Level.,"Activation of the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis using an insulin tolerance test (ITT) is a medical diagnostic procedure that is frequently used in humans to assess the HPA and growth-hormone (GH) axes. Whether sex differences exist in the response to ITT stress is unknown. Thus, investigations into the analysis of transcripts during activation of the HPA axis in response to hypoglycemia have revealed the underlying influences of sex in signaling pathways that stimulate the HPA axis. We assessed four time points of ITT application in Balb/c mice. After insulin injection, expression levels of 192 microRNAs and 41 mRNAs associated with the HPA, GH�and hypothalamic-pituitary-gonadal (HPG) axes were determined by real-time RT-PCR in the hypothalamus, pituitary and adrenal tissues, as well as blood samples (Raw data accession: https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/10qI00NAtjxOepcNKxSJnQbJeBFa6zgHK?usp=sharing ). Although the ITT is commonly used as a gold standard for evaluating the HPA axis, we found completely different responses between males and females with respect to activation of the HPA axis. While activation of several transcripts in the hypothalamus and pituitary was observed after performing the ITT in males within 10�min, females responded via the pituitary and adrenal immediately and durably over 40�min. Additionally, we found that microRNA alterations precede mRNA responses in the HPA axis. Furthermore, robust changes in the levels of several transcripts including Avpr1b and Avpr2 observed at all time points strongly suggest that transcriptional control of these genes occurs mostly via differential signaling in pituitary and blood between males and females. Male and female HPA axis responses to ITT involve a number of sophisticated regulatory signaling pathways of miRNAs and mRNAs. Our results highlight the first robust markers in several layers of HPA, HPG and GH axis involved in ITT/hypoglycemia stress-induced dynamics.","kes, hji",0.0,0,0,2,0.0,,

Outcomes assessed were human-milk energy (kcal/L), fat (g/L), and total protein (g/L) from mothers 1 to 6 mo postpartum. Studies with data on maternal BMI or weight and height that quantified human-milk energy, fat, or protein between 1 and 6 mo postpartum were eligible. Random-effects meta-regression weighted by the inverse of the study-level SE was completed for each of the 3 outcomes. The certainty of evidence for each outcome was assessed using the GRADE (Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development, and Evaluation) approach.<h4>Results</h4>A total of 11,373 titles and abstracts were identified, and after full-text screening, 69 articles of 66 studies were included. Meta-regression results showed a positive association between maternal BMI and human-milk fat (�: 0.56 g/L; 95% CI: 0.034, 1.1; P = 0.04; I2 = 93.7%, n = 63 datapoints). There was no significant association between maternal BMI and human-milk energy (�: 3.9 kcal/L; 95% CI: -1.6, 9.5; P = 0.16, I2 = 93.3%, n = 40 datapoints) or total protein (�: 0.13 g/L; 95% CI: -0.16, 0.41; P = 0.37, I2 = 99.1%, n = 40 datapoints). The certainty of evidence for human-milk energy was low and the certainty of evidence for fat and total protein was very low.<h4>Conclusions</h4>Meta-regression analysis of available literature suggested an association between maternal BMI and human-milk fat between 1 and 6 mo postpartum. Future studies are needed to confirm the relation between maternal BMI; variation in human-milk energy, fat, and protein content; and the implications for child growth and development.

High mortality is associated with patients developing cytokine storm syndrome. Treatment of hyper-inflammation in these patients using existing, approved therapies with proven safety profiles could address the immediate need to reduce mortality.<h4>Results</h4>We analyzed the changes in the gene expression, pathways and putative mechanisms induced by SARS-CoV2 in NHBE, and A549 cells, as well as COVID-19 lung vs. their respective controls. We used these changes to identify FDA approved drugs that could be repurposed to help COVID-19 patients with severe symptoms related to hyper-inflammation. We identified methylprednisolone (MP) as a potential leading therapy. The results were then confirmed in five independent validation data sets including Vero E6 cells, lung and intestinal organoids, as well as additional patient lung sample vs. their respective controls. Finally, the efficacy of MP was validated in an independent clinical study. Thirty-day all-cause mortality occurred at a significantly lower rate in the MP-treated group compared to control group (29.6% vs. 16.6%, p = 0.027). Clinical results confirmed the in silico prediction that MP could improve outcomes in severe cases of COVID-19. A low number needed to treat (NNT = 5) suggests MP may be more efficacious than dexamethasone or hydrocortisone.<h4>Availability</h4>iPathwayGuide is available at https://ipathwayguide.advaitabio.com/.<h4>Supplementary information</h4>Supplementary data are available at Bioinformatics online.","kes, hji",0.0,0,0,2,0.0,,
33720349,"Robust, flexible, and scalable tests for Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium across diverse ancestries.","Traditional Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium (HWE) tests (the <U+03C7>2 test and the exact test) have long been used as a metric for evaluating genotype quality, as technical artifacts leading to incorrect genotype calls often can be identified as deviations from HWE. However, in data sets composed of individuals from diverse ancestries, HWE can be violated even without genotyping error, complicating the use of HWE testing to assess genotype data quality. In this manuscript, we present the Robust Unified Test for HWE (RUTH) to test for HWE while accounting for population structure and genotype uncertainty, and to evaluate the impact of population heterogeneity and genotype uncertainty on the standard HWE tests and alternative methods using simulated and real sequence data sets. Our results demonstrate that ignoring population structure or genotype uncertainty in HWE tests can inflate false-positive rates by many orders of magnitude. Our evaluations demonstrate different tradeoffs between false positives and statistical power across the methods, with RUTH consistently among the best across all evaluations. RUTH is implemented as a practical and scalable software tool to rapidly perform HWE tests across millions of markers and hundreds of thousands of individuals while supporting standard VCF/BCF formats.

33725111,Whole genome analysis of more than 10 000 SARS-CoV-2 virus unveils global genetic diversity and target region of NSP6.,"Whole genome analysis of SARS-CoV-2 is important to identify its genetic diversity. Moreover, accurate detection of SARS-CoV-2 is required for its correct diagnosis. To address these, first we have analysed publicly available 10 664 complete or near-complete SARS-CoV-2 genomes of 73 countries globally to find mutation points in the coding regions as substitution, deletion, insertion and single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) globally and country wise. In this regard, multiple sequence alignment is performed in the presence of reference sequence from NCBI. Once the alignment is done, a consensus sequence is build to analyse each genomic sequence to identify the unique mutation points as substitutions, deletions, insertions and SNPs globally, thereby resulting in 7209, 11700, 119 and 53 such mutation points respectively. Second, in such categories, unique mutations for individual countries are determined with respect to other 72 countries. In case of India, unique 385, 867, 1 and 11 substitutions, deletions, insertions and SNPs are present in 566 SARS-CoV-2 genomes while 458, 1343, 8 and 52 mutation points in such categories are common with other countries. In majority (above 10%) of virus population, the most frequent and common mutation points between global excluding India and India are L37F, P323L, F506L, S507G, D614G and Q57H in NSP6, RdRp, Exon, Spike and ORF3a respectively. While for India, the other most frequent mutation points are T1198K, A97V, T315N and P13L in NSP3, RdRp, Spike and ORF8 respectively. These mutations are further visualised in protein structures and phylogenetic analysis has been done to show the diversity in virus genomes. Third, a web application is provided for searching mutation points globally and country wise.

33751898,Rate of Communicative Gestures and Developmental Outcomes in Toddlers With and Without Autism Spectrum Disorder During a Home Observation.,"Purpose Most toddlers with autism spectrum disorder and other developmental delays receive early intervention at home and may not participate in a clinic-based communication evaluation. However, there is limited research that has prospectively examined communication in very young children with and without autism in a home-based setting. This study used granular observational coding to document the communicative acts performed by toddlers with autism, developmental delay, and typical development in the home environment. Method Children were selected from the archival database of the FIRST WORDS Project (<i>N</i> = 211). At approximately 20 months of age, each child participated in everyday activities with a caregiver during an hour-long, video-recorded, naturalistic home observation. Inventories of unique gestures, rates per minute, and proportions of types of communicative acts and communicative functions were coded and compared using a one-way analysis of variance. Concurrent and prospective relationships between rate of communication and measures of social communication, language development, and autism symptoms were examined. Results A total of 40,738 communicative acts were coded. Children with autism, developmental delay, and typical development used eight, nine, and 12 unique gestures on average, respectively. Children with autism used deictic gestures, vocalizations, and communicative acts for behavior regulation at significantly lower rates than the other groups. Statistically significant correlations were observed between rate of communication and several outcome measures. Conclusion Observation of social communication in the natural environment may improve early identification of children with autism and communication delays, complement clinic-based assessments, and provide useful information about a child's social communication profile and the family's preferred activities and intervention priorities.

33761699,Increased bleeding events with the addition of apixaban to the dual anti-platelet regimen for the treatment of patients with acute coronary syndrome: A meta-analysis.,"<h4>Background</h4>Dual anti-platelet therapy (DAPT) with aspirin and clopidogrel has been the mainstay of treatment for patients with acute coronary syndrome (ACS). However, the recurrence of thrombotic events, potential aspirin and clopidogrel hypo-responsiveness, and other limitations of DAPT have led to the development of newer oral anti-thrombotic drugs. Apixaban, a new non-vitamin K antagonist, has been approved for use. In this meta-analysis, we aimed to compare the bleeding outcomes observed with the addition of apixaban to DAPT for the treatment of patients with ACS.<h4>Methods</h4>Online databases including EMBASE, Cochrane Central, http://www.ClinicalTrials.gov, MEDLINE and Web of Science were searched for English based publications comparing the use of apixaban added to DAPT for the treatment of patients with ACS. Different categories of bleeding events and cardiovascular outcomes were assessed. The analysis was carried out by the RevMan software version 5.4. Odds ratios (OR) with 95% confidence intervals (CI) were used to represent the data following analysis.<h4>Results</h4>This research analysis consisted of 4 trials with a total number of 9010 participants. Thrombolysis in myocardial infarction (TIMI) defined major bleeding (OR: 2.45, 95% CI: 1.45-4.12; P = .0008), TIMI defined minor bleeding (OR: 3.12, 95% CI: 1.71-5.70; P = .0002), International society of thrombosis and hemostasis (ISTH) major bleeding (OR: 2.49, 95% CI: 1.80-3.45; P = .00001) and Global Use of Strategies to Open Occluded Arteries (GUSTO) defined severe bleeding (OR: 3.00, 95% CI: 1.56-5.78; P = .01) were significantly increased with the addition of apixaban to DAPT versus DAPT alone in these patients with ACS. However fatal bleeding (OR: 10.96, 95% CI: 0.61-198.3; P = .11) was not significantly different.<h4>Conclusions</h4>Addition of the novel oral anticoagulant apixaban to the DAPT regimen significantly increased bleeding and therefore did not show any beneficial effect in these patients with ACS. However, due to the extremely limited data, we apparently have to rely on future larger studies to confirm this hypothesis.","kes, hji",0.0,0,0,2,0.0,,
33816867,"Citation.js: a format-independent, modular bibliography tool for the browser and command line.","<h4>Background</h4>Given the vast number of standards and formats for bibliographical data, any program working with bibliographies and citations has to be able to interpret such data. This paper describes the development of Citation.js (https://citation.js.org/), a tool to parse and format according to those standards. The program follows modern guidelines for software in general and JavaScript in specific, such as version control, source code analysis, integration testing and semantic versioning.<h4>Results</h4>The result is an extensible tool that has already seen adaption in a variety of sources and use cases: as part of a server-side page generator of a publishing platform, as part of a local extensible document generator, and as part of an in-browser converter of extracted references. Use cases range from transforming a list of DOIs or Wikidata identifiers into a BibTeX file on the command line, to displaying RIS references on a webpage with added Altmetric badges to generating """"How to cite this"""" sections on a blog. The accuracy of conversions is currently 27% for properties and 60% for types on average and a typical initialization takes 120 ms in browsers and 1 s with Node.js on the command line.<h4>Conclusions</h4>Citation.js is a library supporting various formats of bibliographic information in a broad selection of use cases and environments.

33851388,Acquired FXIII Deficiency is Associated with High Morbidity.,"<h4>Background</h4> A factor XIII (FXIII) level >30% is considered necessary to prevent spontaneous bleeding. Bleeding is also a risk in patients with acquired FXIII deficiency, but the hemostatic level of FXIII in this context remains to be determined.<h4>Methods</h4> We retrospectively analyzed all patients diagnosed with acquired FXIII deficiency at a large hospital over 3 years (study ID NCT04416594, http://www.clinicaltrials.gov) and assessed clinical data to identify the best cut-off point for FXIII activity to distinguish between low and high risk of major bleeding in a mixed medical and surgical population.<h4>Results</h4> Of the 97 patients who experienced bleeding despite a normal coagulation test, 43.2% had FXIII activity <70%. FXIII activity was significantly lower in surgical patients and patients admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU). Low FXIII activity was significantly associated with long ICU stays and a high incidence of major bleeding.<h4>Conclusion</h4> Acquired FXIII deficiency is associated with high morbidity. The hemostatic level of FXIII in the setting of acquired FXIII deficiency might be above 30%.","kes, hji",0.0,0,0,2,0.0,,
33900211,"Effect of Diameter and Number of Hepatocellular Carcinomas on Survival After Resection, Transarterial Chemoembolization, and Ablation.","<h4>Introduction</h4>Most studies predicting survival after resection, transarterial chemoembolization (TACE), and ablation analyzed diameter and number of hepatocellular carcinomas (HCCs) as dichotomous variables, resulting in an underestimation of risk variation. We aimed to develop and validate a new prognostic model for patients with HCC using largest diameter and number of HCCs as continuous variables.<h4>Methods</h4>The prognostic model was developed using data from patients undergoing resection, TACE, and ablation in 645 Japanese institutions. The model results were shown after balanced using the inverse probability of treatment-weighted analysis and were externally validated in an international multi-institution cohort.<h4>Results</h4>Of 77,268 patients, 43,904 patients, including 15,313 (34.9%) undergoing liver resection, 13,375 (30.5%) undergoing TACE, and 15,216 (34.7%) undergoing ablation, met the inclusion criteria. Our model (http://www.u-tokyo-hbp-transplant-surgery.jp/about/calculation.html) showed that the 5-year overall survival (OS) in patients with HCC undergoing these procedures decreased with progressive incremental increases in diameter and number of HCCs. For patients undergoing resection, the inverse probability of treatment-weighted-adjusted 5-year OS probabilities were 10%-20% higher compared with patients undergoing TACE for 1-6 HCC lesions <10 cm and were also 10%-20% higher compared with patients undergoing ablation when the HCC diameter was 2-3 cm. For patients undergoing resection and TACE, the model performed well in the external cohort.<h4>Discussion</h4>Our novel prognostic model performed well in predicting OS after resection and TACE for HCC and demonstrated that resection may have a survival benefit over TACE and ablation based on the diameter and number of HCCs.","kes, hji",0.0,0,0,2,0.0,,
33902704,The impact of sequencing depth on the inferred taxonomic composition and AMR gene content of metagenomic samples.,"<h4>Background</h4>Shotgun metagenomics is increasingly used to characterise microbial communities, particularly for the investigation of antimicrobial resistance (AMR) in different animal and environmental contexts. There are many different approaches for inferring the taxonomic composition and AMR gene content of complex community samples from shotgun metagenomic data, but there has been little work establishing the optimum sequencing depth, data processing and analysis methods for these samples. In this study we used shotgun metagenomics and sequencing of cultured isolates from the same samples to address these issues. We sampled three potential environmental AMR gene reservoirs (pig caeca, river sediment, effluent) and sequenced samples with shotgun metagenomics at high depth (~ 200 million reads per sample). Alongside this, we cultured single-colony isolates of Enterobacteriaceae from the same samples and used hybrid sequencing (short- and long-reads) to create high-quality assemblies for comparison to the metagenomic data. To automate data processing, we developed an open-source software pipeline, 'ResPipe'.<h4>Results</h4>Taxonomic profiling was much more stable to sequencing depth than AMR gene content. 1 million reads per sample was sufficient to achieve < 1% dissimilarity to the full taxonomic composition. However, at least 80 million reads per sample were required to recover the full richness of different AMR gene families present in the sample, and additional allelic diversity of AMR genes was still being discovered in effluent at 200 million reads per sample. Normalising the number of reads mapping to AMR genes using gene length and an exogenous spike of Thermus thermophilus DNA substantially changed the estimated gene abundance distributions. While the majority of genomic content from cultured isolates from effluent was recoverable using shotgun metagenomics, this was not the case for pig caeca or river sediment.<h4>Conclusions</h4>Sequencing depth and profiling method can critically affect the profiling of polymicrobial animal and environmental samples with shotgun metagenomics. Both sequencing of cultured isolates and shotgun metagenomics can recover substantial diversity that is not identified using the other methods. Particular consideration is required when inferring AMR gene content or presence by mapping metagenomic reads to a database.

33968128,The Molecular Functions of MeCP2 in Rett Syndrome Pathology.,"MeCP2 protein, encoded by the <i>MECP2</i> gene, binds to DNA and affects transcription. Outside of this activity the true range of MeCP2 function is still not entirely clear. As <i>MECP2</i> gene mutations cause the neurodevelopmental disorder Rett syndrome in 1 in 10,000 female births, much of what is known about the biologic function of MeCP2 comes from studying human cell culture models and rodent models with <i>Mecp2</i> gene mutations. In this review, the full scope of MeCP2 research available in the NIH Pubmed (https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/) data base to date is considered. While not all original research can be mentioned due to space limitations, the main aspects of MeCP2 and Rett syndrome research are discussed while highlighting the work of individual researchers and research groups. First, the primary functions of MeCP2 relevant to Rett syndrome are summarized and explored. Second, the conflicting evidence and controversies surrounding emerging aspects of MeCP2 biology are examined. Next, the most obvious gaps in MeCP2 research studies are noted. Finally, the most recent discoveries in MeCP2 and Rett syndrome research are explored with a focus on the potential and pitfalls of novel treatments and therapies.","kes, hji",0.0,0,0,2,0.0,,
34013078,Host pharmacogenetic factors that may affect liver neoplasm incidence upon using direct-acting antivirals for treating hepatitis C infection.,"<h4>Introduction</h4>Direct-acting antivirals (DAAs) represent a breakthrough in hepatitis C virus (HCV) treatment as they directly inhibit HCV nonstructural (NS) proteins (NS3/4A, NS5A, and NS5B). However, ongoing debates exist regarding their relationship with hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) whose incidence is widely debated among investigators. This study was conducted to identify host pharmacogenetic factors that may influence HCC incidence upon using HCV DAAs.<h4>Materials and methods</h4>Details regarding 16 HCV DAAs were collected from literature and DrugBank database. Digital structures of these drugs were fed into the pharmacogenomics/pharmacovigilance <i>in</i> <i>-</i> <i>silico</i> pipeline (PHARMIP) to predict the genetic factors that may underpin HCC development.<h4>Results</h4>We identified 184 unique genes and 40 unique variants that may have key answers for the DAA/HCC paradox. These findings could be used in different methods to aid in the precise application of HCV DAAs and minimize the proposed risk for HCC. All results could be accessed at: https://doi.org/10.17632/8ws8258hn3.2.<h4>Discussion</h4>All the identified factors are evidence related to HCC and significantly predicted by PHARMIP as DAA targets. We discuss some examples of the methods of using these results to address the DAA/HCC controversy based on the following three primary levels: 1 - individual DAA drug, 2 - DAA subclass, and 3 - the entire DAA class. Further wet laboratory investigation is required to evaluate these results.","kes, hji",0.0,0,0,2,0.0,,mendely

Findings from analyses of whole-genome sequences show great promise for informing strategies to mitigate risks from diseases caused by phytopathogens. Genomic approaches can be used to dramatically shorten response times to outbreaks and inform disease management in novel ways. However, the use of these approaches requires expertise in working with big, complex data sets and an understanding of their pitfalls and limitations to infer well-supported conclusions. We suggest using an evolutionary framework to guide the use of genomic approaches in epidemiology and diagnostics of plant pathogens.

34036443,"BDD Knowledge, Attitude and Practice Among Aesthetic Plastic Surgeons Worldwide.","<h4>Background</h4>Body dysmorphic disorder (BDD) is a controversial topic in the field of plastic surgery.<h4>Objective</h4>Our aim was to determine whether BDD knowledge, attitude and practice (KAP) are affected by the experience of the surgeon in the field, sex of the surgeon, country of practice, and the number of patients the surgeon sees annually. We were particularly interested in uncovering any significant relations in KAP of BDD between plastic surgeons practicing in developed versus developing countries.<h4>Methods</h4>We created a two-page survey of 24 questions about the KAP of BDD. The survey was sent to aesthetic plastic surgeons worldwide via ISAPS global email list. The data were collected over a period of 20 days at the end of 2020.<h4>Results</h4>A total of 464 plastic surgeons completed the survey. The only factor that determines the awareness of BDD is the experience of the surgeon. The more experienced the surgeon is, the more likely he/she is to be familiar with the clinical picture of BDD. Although aware, the more experienced surgeons tend to dismiss the importance of referring BDD patients to psychiatrists/psychologists. Male surgeons tend to diagnose more patients with BDD than female surgeons. Surgeons who estimated the correct prevalence of BDD among patients seeking surgery acquired knowledge of BDD from scientific journals. The KAP is relatively similar between surgeons practicing in developed and developing countries, and the main statistically significant difference was in the questions used during the course of the interviews to diagnose BDD.<h4>Conclusion</h4>We can deduce from the results that most aesthetic surgeons worldwide have got knowledge of the presentation of BDD and are keen to diagnose the disorder in their practice. It is worth noting that surgeons usually have their unique approach in the management of BDD. Our study highlights the importance of not only raising awareness of the best management of BDD, but also of establishing a consensus that BDD is a contraindication to aesthetic treatment. The best methods to raise awareness are through journals and plastic surgery residency.<h4>Level of evidence v</h4>This journal requires that authors assign a level of evidence to each article.

34043002,Identification of evolutionarily stable functional and immunogenic sites across the SARS-CoV-2 proteome and greater coronavirus family.,"<h4>Motivation</h4>Since the first recognized case of COVID-19, more than 100 million people have been infected worldwide. Global efforts in drug and vaccine development to fight the disease have yielded vaccines and drug candidates to cure COVID-19. However, the spread of SARS-CoV-2 variants threatens the continued efficacy of these treatments. In order to address this, we interrogate the evolutionary history of the entire SARS-CoV-2 proteome to identify evolutionarily conserved functional sites that can inform the search for treatments with broader coverage across the coronavirus family.<h4>Results</h4>Combining coronavirus family sequence information with the mutations observed in the current COVID-19 outbreak, we systematically and comprehensively define evolutionarily stable sites that may provide useful drug and vaccine targets and which are less likely to be compromised by the emergence of new virus strains. Several experimentally-validated effective drugs interact with these proposed target sites. In addition, the same evolutionary information can prioritize cross reactive antigens that are useful in directing multi-epitope vaccine strategies to illicit broadly neutralizing immune responses to the betacoronavirus family. Although the results are focused on SARS-CoV-2, these approaches stem from evolutionary principles that are agnostic to the organism or infective agent.<h4>Availability</h4>The results of this work are made interactively available at http://cov.lichtargelab.org.<h4>Supplementary information</h4>Supplementary data are available at Bioinformatics online.","kes, hji",0.0,0,0,2,0.0,,

34186186,"In silico modelling of acute toxicity of 1, 2, 4-triazole antifungal agents towards zebrafish (Danio rerio) embryos: Application of the Small Dataset Modeller tool.","Nowadays, there is a widespread use of triazole antifungal agents to kill broad classes of fungi in farming lands and to protect herbs, fruits and grains. These agents further deposit into the aquatic systems causing toxicity to the living aquatic creatures, which can then affect human beings. Considering this issue, risk assessment of these toxic chemicals is a very essential task. Due to the inadequate experimental data on acute toxicity of antifungal agents containing the 1, 2, 4-triazole ring, higher testing costs along with the regulatory restrictions and the international regulations to lessen animal testing emphasize on in silico techniques such as quantitative structure-activity relationship (QSAR) studies. The application of QSAR modelling has created an easier avenue to predict activity/property/toxicity of newly synthesized compounds. In the present study, we have used 23 antifungal agents containing the 1, 2, 4-triazole ring to develop 2D-QSAR models and explored their structural attributes crucial for acute toxicity towards embryonic phase of zebrafish (Danio rerio). Here, we have employed simple 2D descriptors to develop the QSAR models. The models were evolved by executing the Small Dataset Modeller tool (https://dtclab.webs.com/software-tools), and the validation of the models was achieved by employing different precise validation principles. The statistical validation metrics confirm that built models are robust, useful and well predictive to forecast the acute toxicity of new compounds.","kes, hji",0.0,0,0,2,0.0,,

As the number of experimentally verified bioactive peptides has increased significantly, various of in silico approaches are imperative for investigating the characteristics of ACPs. However, the lack of methods for investigating the differences in physicochemical properties of ACPs. In this study, we compared the N- and C-terminal amino acid composition for each peptide, there are three major subtypes of ACPs that are defined based on the distribution of positively charged residues. For the first time, we were motivated to develop a two-step machine learning model for identification of the subtypes of ACPs, which classify the input data into the corresponding group before applying the classifier. Further, to improve the predictive power, the hybrid feature sets were considered for prediction. Evaluation by five-fold cross-validation showed that the two-step model trained with sequence-based features and physicochemical properties was most effective in discriminating between ACPs and non-ACPs. The two-step model trained with the hybrid features performed well, with a sensitivity of 86.75%, a specificity of 85.75%, an accuracy of 86.08%, and a Matthews Correlation Coefficient value of 0.703. Furthermore, the model also consistently provides the effective performance in independent testing set, with sensitivity of 77.6%, specificity of 94.74%, accuracy of 88.99% and the MCC value reached 0.75.

34210950,Exploration of the Important Role of Microfibril-Associated Protein 4 Gene in Oral Squamous Cell Carcinoma.,"BACKGROUND Oral squamous cell carcinoma (OSCC) is a common tumor of the head and neck. Its treatment usually requires multiple modalities. Currently, there are no molecular biomarkers to guide these treatment strategies. Studies have shown that microfibril-associated protein 4 (MFAP4) is potentially useful for non-invasive assessment of various diseases; however, its biological function in tumors is still unknown. In this study, we propose that MFAP4 is a new prognostic target for OSCC. MATERIAL AND METHODS First, we collected OSCC data (GSE25099 and GSE30784 datasets) from the Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) database and compared the differential expression of MFAP4 gene between the patients (tumor) and normal (control) groups. The comparison was done with University of California Santa Cruz Xena (https://xenabrowser.net/Datapages/), and we calculated the difference in MFAP4 gene expression between normal and tumor tissues in a pan-cancer analysis. Then, we compared the 2 groups with high and low expression of MFAP4 gene in terms of tumor mutation burden (TMB), miRNA regulation, and immune cell infiltration. RESULTS We found that the expression of MFAP4 gene was significantly decreased in tumors. Our research also showed that high expression of MFAP4 was related to better prognosis of patients and may be related to tumor gene mutation, miRNA regulation, and infiltration of different immune cells. CONCLUSIONS Our work provides evidence that expression of MFAP4 can be used as a prognostic biomarker for risk stratification of OSCC patients and elaborates on its relation with the regulation of TMB, miRNAs, and immune cell infiltration.","kes, hji",0.0,0,0,2,0.0,,references other data resource
34266288,CGRP measurements in human plasma - a methodological study.,"<h4>Background</h4>Calcitonin gene-related peptide plasma levels have frequently been determined as a biomarker for primary headaches. However, published data is often inconsistent resulting from different methods that are not precisely described in most studies.<h4>Methods</h4>We applied a well-proven enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay to measure calcitonin gene-related peptide concentrations in human blood plasma, we modified parameters of plasma preparation and protein purification and used calcitonin gene-related peptide-free plasma for standard solutions, which are described in detail.<h4>Results</h4>Calcitonin gene-related peptide levels are stable in plasma with peptidase inhibitors and after deep-freezing. Calcitonin gene-related peptide standard solutions based on synthetic intercellular fluid or pooled plasma with pre-absorbed calcitonin gene-related peptide influenced the measurements but yielded both comprehensible results. In a sample of 56 healthy subjects the calcitonin gene-related peptide plasma levels varied considerably from low (<50 pg/mL) to very high (>500 pg/mL) values. After a 12-hour exposure of these subjects to normobaric hypoxia the individual calcitonin gene-related peptide levels remained stable.<h4>Conclusion</h4>Buffering with peptidase inhibitors and immediate freezing or processing of plasma samples is essential to achieve reliable measurements. Individuals show considerable differences and partly high calcitonin gene-related peptide plasma levels without detectable pathological reason. Thus plasma measurements are suited particularly to follow calcitonin gene-related peptide levels in longitudinal studies.The use of data for this study was approved by the Ethics Committee of the MedicalUniversity of Innsbruck (https://www.i-med.ac.at/ethikkommission/; EK Nr: 1242/2017).","kes, hji",0.0,0,0,2,0.0,,
34282687,Glucosinolate-Enriched Fractions from Maca (<i>Lepidium meyenii</i>) Exert Myrosinase-Dependent Cytotoxic Effects against HepG2/C3A and HT29 Tumor Cell Lines.,"The consumption of glucosinolate (GL)-rich foods, including <i>Brassica</i> vegetables, such as mustard, broccoli, and maca, is associated with decreased risk of developing cancer. The GL content in maca, which is recognized as a """"superfood"""", is approximately 100-times higher than that in other brassicas. Although maca is a potential dietary source of GLs, limited studies have examined the bioactivity of maca GLs using the combination of chemical characterization and bioassays. In this study, the fractions (Lm-II and Lm-III) rich in intact GLs (glucotropaeolin and glucolimnanthin) were isolated and characterized from maca ethanolic extracts using chromatography and mass spectrometry. Additionally, the growth-inhibitory effects of Lm-II and Lm-II fractions against hepatocellular carcinoma (HepG2/C3A) and colon adenocarcinoma (HT29) cell lines were examined in the absence or presence of myrosinase (MYR). Fractions lacking low molecular weight sugars dose-dependently exerted cytotoxic effects in the presence of MYR. The half-maximal inhibitory concentration values of Lm-II and Lm-III against HepG2/C3A were 118.8 and 69.9 �g/mL, respectively, while those against HT29 were 102.6 and 71.5 �g/mL, respectively. These results suggest that the anticancer properties of maca can be attributed to GLs and corroborate the categorization of maca as a """"superfood.""""Supplemental data for this article is available online at https://doi.org/10.1080/01635581.2021.1952444.","kes, hji",0.0,0,0,2,0.0,,

The subfamily Vatinae is redefined to only include Neotropical taxa with the removal of distantly related African and Asian lineages. A new tribe is erected under Vatinae (Heterovatini trib.n.) for two unique genera with historically unstable taxonomic placement (Heterovates Saussure and Chopardiella Giglio-Tos). Phylogenetic results and morphology support the synonymy of three genera (Lobovates Deeleman-Reinhold, Phyllovates Kirby, and Hagiotata Saussure & Zehntner) and the validity of Chopardiella Giglio-Tos, Heterovates Saussure, Callivates Roy, Pseudovates Saussure, Vates Burmeister, and Zoolea Audinet Serville. A new genus (Alangularis gen.n.) is created for a former species of Vates with unique morphology and separate phylogenetic placement. All genera are redescribed based on external morphology and the male genital complex. A key to genera for Vatinae is provided with dorsal habitus images of representatives for each genus. A distinct pattern of correlated evolution of morphological characters linked to crypsis was uncovered. Cuticular leg lobes within single leg segments are evolving as sets, and serially homologous lobes appear simultaneously or in close succession. The posteroventral lobes in the apical position on thoracic femora appear to be the precursors to multiple positive rate shifts in the evolutionary accumulation of cryptic features. One shift occurred early in the evolution of Vatinae while the second occurred much later, after the loss and re-evolution of the posteroventral lobes in the apical position on thoracic femora, a violation of Dollo's law.

To ensure that data for retail beef cuts in USDA's National Nutrient Database for Standard Reference (SR) are current, a comprehensive, nationwide, multi-phase study was conducted. Samples were collected and analyzed in three phases based on primal category. Using a statistically based sampling plan, 72 beef carcasses per phase were obtained with nationally representative quality and yield grades, genders and genetic types. Retail cuts were fabricated, cooked and dissected to obtain component weights. Nutrient values were determined by validated laboratories using quality assurance procedures. Full nutrient profiles were made available in SR (http://www.ars.usda.gov/nutrientdata). Results for 16 beef retail cuts were compared for cooking yield and protein, fat and moisture concentrations. For example, cooked fat levels differed among three roasted cuts and among three grilled cuts from chuck, rib and loin (p<0.01). Cooking yield for roasted ribeye (76%) was lower (p<0.001) than for grilled ribeye (83%) or for chuck eye grilled (80%) or roasted (84%). This study demonstrates the importance of maintaining data for a variety of retail beef cuts due to their unique properties and different cooking methods.","kes, hji",0.0,0,0,2,0.0,,references other data resource
IND605743169,Estimating Thermodynamic Properties of Pure Triglyceride Systems Using the Triglyceride Property Calculator,"To date, the most comprehensive model for predicting thermodynamic properties of pure triglycerides was presented by Wesdorp in �<U+0080><U+009C>Liquid-multiple solid phase equilibria in fats: theory and experiments�<U+0080>� (1990). In this paper, we present (1) corrections to the published model, as well as (2) a software implementation of the model for numerical assessment. The software tool, Triglyceride Property Calculator (TPC), uses a semi-empirical model to estimate the enthalpy of fusion and melting temperature for a given triglyceride based on its molecular composition and polymorphic form. These estimates are compared to experimentally collected data when available. The web application is available at http://www.crcfoodandhealth.com (under research tools) and through the AOCS Lipid Library. The quality of estimates is characterized according to defined counting metrics and presented for TAG subcategories. Additionally, the extrapolative value of the TPC is assessed by checking for consistency with underlying thermodynamic constraints. The current TPC implementation is effective in describing experimentally collected melting point data, with greater than 91% of the fitted values falling within 10% of the actual data. The TPC is also very good at describing collected enthalpy data. The underlying semi-empirical model and parameter set perform well in ensuring enthalpy predictions are thermodynamically consistent, however, extrapolated melting temperatures appear unreliable. Developing models and parameter sets that ensure thermodynamic consistency is a priority with future TPC iterations.","kes, hji",0.0,0,0,2,0.0,,
IND605918011,Genetic diversity of endangered orchid Phaius australis across a fragmented Australian landscape,"Historical events such as colonisation, spatial distribution across different habitats, and contemporary processes, such as human-mediated habitat fragmentation can leave lasting imprints on the population genetics of a species. Orchids currently comprise 17% of threatened flora species in Australia (Environment Protection and Biodiversity Conservation Act 1999) due to the combination of fragmentation and illegal harvesting (Benwell in Recovery plan, swamp orchids Phaius australis, Phaius tancarvilliae, NSW National Parks and Wildlife Service, Sydney, 1994; Jones in A complete guide to native orchids of Australia including the island territories, 2nd�edn, Reed Natural History, Sydney, 2006; DE in Phaius australis in species profile and threats database, Department of the Environment. http://www.environment.gov.au/sprat , 2015). The federally endangered Swamp Orchid Phaius australis has a disjunct distribution across an almost 2000�km latitudinal range along Australia�s east coast but it was estimated that 95% of the populations have been lost since European settlement (Benwell 1994). Phaius australis is endangered due to illegal collection and habitat loss that has resulted in limited connectivity between populations, in ecosystems that are vulnerable to climate change. Thus the genetic impacts of its history combined with more recent fragmentation may have impacts on its future viability especially in light of changing environmental conditions. Thirty-four populations were sampled from tropical north Queensland to the southern edge of the subtropics in New South Wales. Population genetics analysis was conducted using 13 polymorphic microsatellite markers developed for the species using NextGen sequencing. Spatial genetic patterns indicate post-colonisation divergence from the tropics southwards to its current climate niche limits. Genetic diversity is low across all populations (A = 1.5, H <U+2091> =�0.171), and there is little evidence of genetic differentiation between regions. Consistent with population genetic theory, the historic loss of populations has resulted in significantly lower genetic diversity in small populations compared to large (P, A, He; p < 0.05). The viability and persistence of P. australis populations now and in a changing climate are discussed in the context of conservation priorities.","kes, hji",0.0,0,0,2,0.0,,
IND606755271,Visual features based automated identification of fish species using deep convolutional neural networks,"Morphological based fish species identification is an erroneous and time-consuming process. There are numerous fish species and due to their close resemblance with each other, it is difficult to classify them by external characters. Recently, computer vision and deep learning-based identification of different animal species is being widely used by the researchers. Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) is one of the most analytically powerful tools in deep learning architecture for the image classification based on visual features. This work aims to propose a deep learning framework based on the CNN method for fish species identification. The proposed CNN architecture contains 32 deep layers that are considerably deep to derive valuable and discriminating features from the image. The deep supervision is inflicted on the VGGNet architecture to increase the classification performance by instantly adding four convolutional layers to the training of each level in the network. To test the performance of proposed 32-Layer CNN architecture, we developed a dataset termed as Fish-Pak and is publicly available at Mendeley data (Fish-Pak: https://doi.org/10.17632/n3ydw29sbz.3#folder-6b024354-bae3-460a-a758-352685ba0e38). Fish-Pak contains 915 images with six distinct classes; Ctenopharyngodon idella (Grass carp), Cyprinus carpio (Common carp), Cirrhinus mrigala (Mori), Labeo rohita (Rohu), Hypophthalmichthys molitrix (Silver carp), and Catla catla (Thala) and three different image views (head region, body shape, and scale). To ensure the superior performance of proposed CNN architecture, we have carried out the experimental comparison with other deep learning frameworks involving VGG-16 for transfer learning, one block VGG, two block VGG, three block VGG, LeNet-5, AlexNet, GoogleNet, and ResNet-50 on the Fish-Pak data set. Comprehensive empirical analyses reveal that the proposed method achieves state of the art performance and outperforms existing methods.","kes, hji",0.0,0,0,2,0.0,,mendley data
IND607322953,First Report of Grapevine Red Globe Virus in Grapevines in Washington State,"Grapevine red globe virus (GRGV; genus Maculavirus, family Tymoviridae) has been reported in grapevines (Vitis spp.) from Italy, Greece, France, China, Spain, and Germany and in California, U.S.A. (Cretazzo et al. 2017; Fan et al. 2016; Ruiz-Garcia et al. 2018; Sabanadzovic et al. 2000). During surveys of grapevine nurseries, a total of 241 composite samples, each consisting of four petioles from mature leaves/vine from five asymptomatic grapevines, from 33 grapevine (Vitis vinifera) cultivars were collected. Total RNA isolated from these samples using a Spectrum Total RNA isolation kit (Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, MO) was subjected to high-throughput sequencing (HTS) on an Illumina HiSeq2500 or NovaSeq 6000 platform in paired-end mode (Genomics Core Facility, Huntsman Cancer Institute, Utah University, Salt Lake City, UT). After trimming raw reads based on quality and ambiguity, the paired-end quality reads of approximately 120 (HiSeq) or 145 (NovaSeq) base pair (bp) length were assembled de novo into a pool of contigs (CLC Genomics Workbench 12). These contigs were subjected to BLASTn analysis against the nonredundant virus database from GenBank (https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/blast). A total of 49 contig sequences, ranging from 200 to 1,645 bp in length with an average coverage ranging up to 418.7, aligning with GRGV genome, were detected in cultivars Aglianico, Cabernet franc, Pinot gris, and Riesling. BLASTn analysis of contigs greater than 500 bp in length showed sequence identity between 88.5 and 95% with corresponding GRGV sequences reported from other countries. These results indicated the presence of genetically distinct isolates of GRGV. HTS data also revealed coinfection of GRGV in all samples with one or more of the following viruses and/or viroids: grapevine rupestris stem pitting associated virus, grapevine rupestris vein feathering virus, hop stunt viroid, or grapevine yellow speckle viroid-1. To further confirm infection by GRGV, total RNA was extracted from two asymptomatic Pinot gris vines that previously tested positive in HTS using the Spectrum Total RNA isolation kit and subjected to reverse transcription PCR using primers specific to the replicase polyprotein gene of the virus (RG4847F, 5'-TGGTCTGTTGTTCGCATCTT-3'; RG6076R, 5' CGGAAGGGGAAGCATTGATCT-3' Cretazzo et al. 2017). Sequence analysis of the approximately 1,250-bp amplicons (accession no. MT749359) showed 91.2% nt sequence identity with a corresponding sequence of GRGV isolate from Brazil (KX828704.1). To our knowledge, this is the first report of GRGV in Washington State. Together with the report of the occurrence of GRGV in California (Sabanadzovic et al. 2000), these results indicate wide geographical distribution of the virus. Although GRGV can cause asymptomatic infections in grapevines (Martelli et al. 2002), the economic importance of GRGV as single or coinfections with other viruses needs to be examined to assess the potential significance of the virus to grape production and grapevine certification programs.","kes, hji",0.0,0,0,2,0.0,,

PMC3498971,"BioNetwork Bench: Database and Software for Storage, Query, and Analysis of Gene and Protein Networks","Gene and protein networks offer a powerful approach for integration of the disparate yet complimentary types of data that result from high-throughput analyses. Although many tools and databases are currently available for accessing such data, they are left unutilized by bench scientists as they generally lack features for effective analysis and integration of both public and private datasets and do not offer an intuitive interface for use by scientists with limited computational expertise. We describe BioNetwork Bench, an open source, user-friendly suite of database and software tools for constructing, querying, and analyzing gene and protein network models. It enables biologists to analyze public as well as private gene expression; interactively query gene expression datasets; integrate data from multiple networks; store and selectively share the data and results. Finally, we describe an application of BioNetwork Bench to the assembly and iterative expansion of a gene network that controls the differentiation of retinal progenitor cells into rod photoreceptors. The tool is available from http://bionetworkbench.sourceforge.net/ Background The emergence of high-throughput technologies has allowed many biological investigators to collect a great deal of information about the behavior of genes and gene products over time or during a particular disease state. Gene and protein networks offer a powerful approach for integration of the disparate yet complimentary types of data that result from such high-throughput analyses. There are a growing number of public databases, as well as tools for visualization and analysis of networks. However, such databases and tools have yet to be widely utilized by bench scientists, as they generally lack features for effective analysis and integration of both public and private datasets and do not offer an intuitive interface for use by biological scientists with limited computational expertise. Results We describe BioNetwork Bench, an open source, user-friendly suite of database and software tools for constructing, querying, and analyzing gene and protein network models. BioNetwork Bench currently supports a broad class of gene and protein network models (eg, weighted and un-weighted, undirected graphs, multi-graphs). It enables biologists to analyze public as well as private gene expression, macromolecular interaction and annotation data; interactively query gene expression datasets; integrate data from multiple networks; query multiple networks for interactions of interest; store and selectively share the data as well as results of analyses. BioNetwork Bench is implemented as a plug-in for, and hence is fully interoperable with, Cytoscape, a popular open-source software suite for visualizing macromolecular interaction networks. Finally, we describe an application of BioNetwork Bench to the problem of assembly and iterative expansion of a gene network that controls the differentiation of retinal progenitor cells into rod photoreceptors. Conclusions BioNetwork Bench provides a suite of open source software for construction, querying, and selective sharing of gene and protein networks. Although initially aimed at a community of biologists interested in retinal development, the tool can be adapted easily to work with other biological systems simply by populating the associated database with the relevant datasets.","kes, hji",0.0,0,0,2,0.0,,no new data or value add?
PMC3788421,PS3-52: Heart Health in Your Pocket: Lessons Learned from the Development of a Smartphone App,"<h4>Background/Aims</h4> As part of the Million Hearts national initiative to prevent cardiovascular disease (CVD), there are increasing calls to leverage health information technology. The Marshfield Clinic developed a Heart Health Mobile application (app) that is designed to improve awareness of CVD risk and promote risk factor control among regional smartphone users. It deploys an engaging user interface that provides a brief CVD risk assessment that takes into account self-reported behavioral, familial, and biometric risk factors, including blood pressure and lipids. Users are then directed to nearby community pharmacies, clinics, and other locations where more advanced CVD risk factor screenings can be obtained. Along with social media connections and measurement prompts, basic education materials are provided on key CVD prevention topics such as hypertension, dyslipidemia, weight management, and tobacco cessation. <h4>Methods</h4> A multidisciplinary team of 24 members was created to develop the app over a 30-day timeframe. This team included a broad cross-section of clinical professionals from medicine, epidemiology, health IT, usability and graphic designers, business analytics, and marketing. An Agile programming method was used to promote adaptive planning and evolutionary development in self-organizing, cross-functional teams. <h4>Results</h4> The iOS app was successfully developed, tested, and launched within the 30-day timeframe. It was submitted competitively as part of the Million Hearts Risk Check Challenge, a CVD prevention app contest sponsored by Office of the National Coordinator for Health Information Technology. The final product is shown in detail at http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qfESTQipjtw. The app was developed in six different languages, and epidemiologic data on downloads, unique users, geo-segmentation, risk factor profile, and customer loyalty, among other data points, are actively collected. <h4>Conclusions</h4> Health-related consumer smartphone apps can be developed rapidly and brought to scale as part of healthcare delivery systems� business and clinical strategies. They provide users with important information, education, and directions on CVD prevention and have wide-ranging potential across numerous health conditions. From an HMORN perspective, such apps also provide real-time data collection methods that can be used to identify health trends at a lower cost (and comparable quality) relative to traditional population research methods.","kes, hji",0.0,0,0,2,0.0,,

PMC5888665,T253. THE CORRELATION ANALYSIS BETWEEN RENAMING SCHIZOPHRENIA AND VISITING FREQUENCY OF MENTAL HEALTH SERVICES BY BIG DATA ANALYSIS (INTERNET SEARCHES AND NEWSPAPER ARTICLES) IN SOUTH KOREA,"Abstract <h4>Background</h4> Korean Neuropsychiatric Association changed the Korean term for schizophrenia from �split-mind disorder� to �attunement disorder� in 2012, to dispel the stigma associated with name, and to promote early detection and treatment. Information on the internet affects the public awareness and attitude toward schizophrenia. The main purpose of this study was to investigate the correlation between renaming schizophrenia and the pattern of mental health services utilization by big data analysis of internet (newspaper articles and internet searches) in Korea. <h4>Methods</h4> From January 2016 to September 2017, newspaper articles on �attunement disorder� and �split-mind disorder� available on the internet were classified as related with negative images like crime and helpful or positive in dispelling the stigma. The relationship between the number of anti-stigma newspaper articles and newspaper articles of schizophrenia containing both positive and negative images was examined. In addition, using Naver, a major internet search engine in Korea, we investigated the total number of internet searches of both old and new name of schizophrenia by gender differences. Finally, the frequency of the visits of mental health services of patients with schizophrenia was measured using the Korean Healthcare Bigdata Hub (http://opendata.hira.or.kr/home.do#none) for 14 months and the correlation between the frequency of the visits and the above big data was examined. The data were analyzed using the SPSS/WIN 24.0. Pearson correlation coefficients were used to analyze correlations. <h4>Results</h4> The amounts of newspaper articles containing anti-stigma of schizophrenia were correlated with the amounts of newspaper articles containing negative images like crime of the new name (attunement disorder) of schizophrenia (r=0.528, p<0.01), which was greater than the amounts of newspaper articles containing the old name (split-mind disorder) of schizophrenia (r=0.300, p<0.01). We also found that a strong positive correlation between the number of articles about �attunement disorder� and search frequency about the term on the internet. In addition, the search frequency was more highly related to the number of articles containing negative images of the illness (e.g., related crimes, r = 0.910, p<0.01) than that of articles providing positive aspects of the illness (e.g., dispelling stigma, r = 0.423, p<0.01). There was no significant correlation between the number of schizophrenia-related newspaper articles in previous month and the visits of mental health services of patients with schizophrenia in next month. There were no gender differences in internet searches. The correlation between the internet search frequency for �attunement disorder� in the previous month and the visits of the mental health services of patients with schizophrenia (r = 0.185, p>0.05) in next month was larger than the correlation of �split-mind disorder� searches with mental health services utilization (r = 0.082, p>0.05). <h4>Discussion</h4> �Attunement disorder� rather than �split-mind disorder� was appeared more frequently in newspaper articles of the anti-stigma characteristics. �Attunement disorder� seems to be more useful for anti-stigma campaign. Renaming schizophrenia didn�t seem to affect the visiting frequency of mental health services. There was statistical limitation which was originated from the lack of numbers of patient�s information. It was because Korean Bigdata Hub provided patients information just for 14 months as monthly data. Also, it should be considered that the time period, the kinds of mental disorders and the search engine we investigated were limited. Future research needs to overcome these limitations.","kes, hji",0.0,0,0,2,0.0,,

Because of its potential as a support tool for CNS tumor diagnosis, Infinium MethylationEPIC BeadChip analysis was readily implemented and �routinely� performed on pediatric CNS tumor samples in the PMC. AIM: To identify the challenges and opportunities of methylation profiling as a support tool for the diagnosis of pediatric CNS tumors. PATIENTS AND <h4>METHODS</h4> We have now analyzed >150 pediatric (formalin-fixed/paraffin-embedded) CNS tumor samples using methylation profiling and matched the profiles with the �Heidelberg database� (https://www.molecularneuropathology.org/mnp). <h4>RESULTS</h4> In > 90% of analyzed cases, the suggested methylation class corresponded very well with the pathological (histological +/- molecular) diagnosis. In some other cases, the suggested methylation class was not very helpful because the reliability score of the test was (too) low, or because the suggested class not adequately reflected the actual presence of a tumor (e.g. �reactive/inflammatory changes�) or was not (yet) as precise as desired (e.g. �diffuse glioma/glioblastoma, IDH-wildtype, midline type (but not H3-mutant)�). However, in many other cases the tool was very helpful for reaching a more precise diagnosis (esp. so for medulloblastomas, ependymomas) or directed towards the right diagnosis. <h4>CONCLUSIONS</h4> Methylation profiling is a very powerful tool to confirm, fine-tune and/or direct pediatric CNS tumor diagnostics. However, it is crucial to interpret this new level of information in the clinical, radiological and pathological context.","kes, hji",0.0,0,0,2,0.0,,not about the resource

A total of 590 DNA 600 Duroc finishing pigs (BW=75.7 + 1.0 kg) were blocked by weight and sex and allocated across two dietary treatments with 6 replications per treatment and 21 to 26 pigs per pen. Dietary treatments were: barrow (B) diets with and without LF and gilt (G) diets with and without LF. Diets were formulated to split-sex requirements (CON) for each period and LF diets were control diets + 0.125% LF. The experiment was 44-d where d 0 was 98-d post-wean. All data were analyzed using the MIXED procedure of SAS as a randomized complete block design as a 2 x 2 (diet x sex) factorial arrangement. Pen served as the experimental unit. Overall (d 0-44), the B gained more weight (P = 0.0282) and consumed more feed (P > 0.10) in ADFI. There was no diet x sex interaction (P > 0.10) for ADG. There was a tendency for an interaction (P = 0.0545) for ADFI, where LF B consumed more feed compared to CON B and CON G consumed more feed compared to LF G. There was an interaction for G:F (P = 0.0028) where G on LF had higher G:F compared to G on CON whereas G:F for B was not different to B on LF. In conclusion, LF improved ADG and G:F, but did so differently for G and B.  http://www.conferenceharvester.com/","kes, hji",0.0,0,0,2,0.0,,
PMC6666854,"PSIV-13 Basal endogenous loss, standardized total tract digestibility, and retention of Ca in sows change throughout gestation, but microbial phytase reduces basal endogenous loss of Ca by gestating sows","Abstract The objective was to test the hypothesis that standardized total tract digestibility (STTD) of Ca and Ca and P retention and the response to microbial phytase in diets fed to sows are constant throughout gestation. Thirty-six sows (parity = 3.3) were allotted to 4 diets on d 7 post-breeding. Two corn-based diets in which calcium carbonate was the sole source of Ca and 2 Ca-free diets were formulated without or with phytase (500 units per kg). Sows were housed individually in metabolism crates during early-gestation, mid-gestation, and late-gestation, and feces and urine were quantitatively collected. Data were analyzed by repeated measures using a model that included phytase, period of gestation, and the interaction between phytase and period as fixed effects, and block and replicate as random effects. Interactions between period and phytase were not observed. The basal endogenous loss (BEL) of Ca was greater (P < 0.05) in early-gestation than in mid- and late-gestation, but phytase reduced (P = 0.002) BEL of Ca and tended (P = 0.099) to increase apparent total tract digestibility (ATTD) of P in the Ca-free diet. Phytase did not affect ATTD of DM, STTD of Ca, ATTD of P, or Ca and P retention in sows fed the diet containing calcium carbonate (Table 1). The ATTD of DM was not affected by period, but Ca retention and ATTD of Ca and P were least (P < 0.05) in mid-gestation, followed by early- and late-gestation, and the STTD of Ca in mid-gestation was also reduced (P < 0.05) compared with early- or late-gestation. Phosphorus retention was greater (P < 0.05) in late-gestation than in the earlier periods. In conclusion, BEL of Ca, STTD of Ca, ATTD of P, and Ca and P retention in sows change throughout gestation regardless of use of phytase.  http://www.conferenceharvester.com/","kes, hji",0.0,0,0,2,0.0,,

Describing the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on HIV care in Latin America,"Abstract <h4>Background</h4> The effects of the COVID-19 pandemic on people living with HIV (PWH) are unknown. Beyond SARS-CoV-2 co-infection, the pandemic may have devastating consequences for HIV care delivery. Understanding these is crucial as reduced antiretroviral therapy (ART) availability alone could lead to =500,000 AIDS-related deaths in 2020�2021. With Latin America now a focal point in the pandemic, we sought to describe the impact of COVID-19 on HIV care at Latin American clinical sites. <h4>Methods</h4> Caribbean, Central and South America network for HIV epidemiology (CCASAnet) and additional Brazilian HIV care sites in Argentina, Brazil, Chile, Haiti, Honduras, Mexico, and Peru were included. An electronic survey of COVID-19 effects on HIV clinic operations was administered in Spanish or English via phone and email, April 28-June 2, 2020. We also compared national COVID-19 case, mortality, and policy data from public sources. <h4>Results</h4> Brazil�s and Mexico�s epidemics appear most pronounced, with >10,000 confirmed COVID-19-related deaths (Figure 1); countries implemented �social distancing� policies at different times after initial cases, with Haiti earliest and Mexico latest (Figure 2). Nearly all 13 sites reported decreased hours and providers for HIV care. Twelve of 13 reported increased use of telehealth, suspension/postponements of routine HIV appointments, and/or suspension of HIV research. Eleven of 13 reported initiation of new COVID-19 research but suspension of community HIV testing, and nearly half provided additional ART supplies. Nearly 70% reported impacts on HIV viral load testing and nearly 40% reported personal protective equipment stock-outs (Table). All 13 sites experienced changes in resources/services in tandem with national policies; there was wide variation, however, in the number of economic and health supports implemented thus far (e.g., quarantines, tax deferrals, interest rate reductions, etc.), from 172 COVID-19-related policies in Brazil to only 30 in Mexico.

PMC7989604,"112 Outcomes and Clinical Characteristics of COVID-19 Disease in the Frail, Elderly Population of Tayside","Abstract <h4>Introduction</h4> With advancing age, frailty, multi-morbidity and need for care, elderly patients are some of the most vulnerable to Covid-19 disease. In NHS Tayside, a dedicated Covid-19 Medicine for the Elderly (MFE) Team was formed to care for patients identified as frail and likely to benefit from comprehensive geriatric assessment. <h4>Methods</h4> All Covid-19 patients meeting frailty criteria1, cared for by the Covid-19 MFE Team were identified. Data on outcomes and clinical characteristics for all (140) patients admitted during the first pandemic wave (March�July 2020) was collected using electronic patient records and analysed. <h4>Results</h4> Patients were predominantly male (58.6%). Ages ranged from 65�99�years, with 43.6% aged =85�years. 82.1% had one or more of cough, fever and anosmia on admission fitting Covid-19 case definition 2. Lymphopenia was present in 92.1%. Of note, 26.5% of patients had a normal or unchanged chest x-ray report, with only 10.2% showing bilateral peripheral infiltrates. 28-day mortality was 37.1% with Covid-19 Disease listed as primary cause of death in 90.4%. <h4>Conclusion(s)</h4> Entering further �waves� of infection, it is vital that we understand the clinical presentation and course of Covid-19 disease in elderly patients. Our data highlights that any Covid-19 symptom, even in isolation, should raise suspicion of disease. Chest x-rays should not be used alone as a diagnostic tool. The presence of lymphopenia should raise suspicion of Covid-19 infection. In developing an understanding of how elderly patients with Covid-19 present, we can ensure early identification and initiation of appropriate infection control measures. <h4>References</h4> 1.

PMC8054692,"A Spatial Web Application to Explore the Interactions between Human Mobility, Government Policies, and COVID-19 Cases","Reports of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) cases began in December 2019. Soon after, the virus had spread around the world and became a pandemic. Social restrictions, quarantines, and other governmental policies in response to the pandemic altered normal operations across the world. One area significantly affected is human mobility. Typical movement patterns have been hindered by the pandemic. But inversely, mobility patterns can influence patterns of the virus. With this in mind, we created an interactive web application to visualize in near-real time the relationship between the COVID-19 pandemic and human mobility, as well as the impact of governmental policies at different spatial scales. The web application allows users to select a country at the global scale or a state or county for the USA and then displays a corresponding plot that compares human mobility to COVID-19 cases across time for the location, as well as to policy data. The application is useful for quickly revealing insightful patterns. First, the initial impact of the COVID-19 pandemic was a rather sudden decrease in mobility. Second, a relationship exists between mobility and COVID-19 offset by a lag, but that lag is not consistent over space or time. Third, spatial autocorrelation of relationship is apparent, meaning locations near each other share similar patterns. Overall, the application is a useful data visualization tool that helps uncover patterns that might otherwise go unnoticed.

PMC8090191,Study of Patients’ Characteristics and Mutual Impact Between Covid-19 and Hyperglycemia at a Community Hospital in Central Brooklyn,"Abstract Background: Studies have shown that poorly-controlled hyperglycemia worsens the outcomes in patients with COVID-19 (C-19) and C-19 may damage pancreatic islets via ACE2 receptors causing acute hyperglycemia. The major population we serve at Kingsbrook Jewish Medical Center (KJMC) are underprivileged with many of them having multiple comorbidities. Methods: This is a retrospective study wherein patients, admitted from February 2020 to April 2020 with hyperglycemia, were selected and divided into 2 groups based on presence or absence of C-19. Data include demographics, comorbidities, blood glucose level, serum osmolality, serum bicarbonate, anion gap, acute kidney injury (AKI), serum creatinine, ICU admission, length of stay (LOS) and mortality. Data were analyzed using descriptive study and T-test. Results: 100 patients were included in the C-19 group (CG) and 88 patients were included in the Non C-19 group (NCG). Major comorbidities were similar in both groups including HTN, DM, CKD followed by ESRD. Mean age of patients (years) was 65.68 in CG and 61.17 in NCG. 61% were male in CG and 53.41% were male in NCG. 16% and 9% developed DKA and HHS in CG, and 13.64% and 6.82% developed DKA and HHS in NCG respectively. 15% in CG had combined DKA & HHS and 3.41% had same in NCG. Mean blood glucose level (mg/dl) was 541.6 in CG and 460.0 in NCG (p=0.03). Mean serum osmolality (mOsm/kg) was 335.7 (SD�41.01) in CG and 317.1 (SD�30.54) in NCG (p=0.01). Mean serum bicarbonate (mEq/L) was 17.73 (SD�6.31) in CG and 21.46 (SD�5.94) in NCG (p<0.0001). Mean anion gap was 17.93 (SD�7.6) in CG and 13.10 (SD�7.2) in NCG (p<0.0001). 56% in CG and 37% in NCG developed AKI respectively (p=0.01). Mean serum creatinine (mg/dl) was 4.22 in CG and 1.65 in NCG (p=0.004). 55% of CG were admitted to ICU and 34% of NCG were admitted to ICU (p=0.003). Median LOS (days) in discharged patients was 8 in CG and 5 in NCG (p=0.02). Mortality was 40% in CG and 3.41% in NCG (p<0.0001). 12 patients in CG and 2 patients in NCG developed new-onset diabetes. In the subset of DKA, interestingly, mean age (years) was 61.63 (SD�17.73) in CG and 39.67 in NCG (SD�13.39) (p=0.001). Conclusion: In our study, patients in the CG carry worse laboratory parameters, unfavorable clinical outcomes and strikingly higher mortality. We discovered increased incidence of new-onset diabetes and elderly DKA in CG. In an inner city population like ours, the burden of DM with significant social and health care disparities is quite severe. Diabetic patients with concurrent C-19 infection can have particularly negative outcomes and C-19 possibly damages the pancreatic islets resulting in acute hyperglycemic crisis. Further research on larger population is required.
